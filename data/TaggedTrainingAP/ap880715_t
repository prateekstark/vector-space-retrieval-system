<HEAD>Fight Wimpdom, Abolish Vice Presidency, Professor Says</HEAD>

 The vice presidency converts respectable politicians into champagne-sipping wimps and ought to be abolished, a political scientist says. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> were examples of vigorous congressmen who became victims of a job that has little authority. <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON>, an associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, also said the office is outmoded because the founding fathers conceived of the vice presidency as an advisory post Yet presidents today have plenty of advisers, he said. Worst of all, <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> said, is the effect the vice presidency has on the people who hold the office. `` The vice presidency turns a vigorous, robust individual into a wimp,'' he said. `` After a few years as vice president, even a previously vigorous and creative political leader turns into a wishy-washy, mealy-mouthed sycophant.'' `` Vice presidents have always been wimps. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> were all wimpy vice presidents,'' he said. `` In order to do the job as vice president, they must play the role of a meek and humble servant, a presidential loyalist, a defender of the president's position,'' he said. The country could easily turn to the secretary of state or the speaker of the House of Representatives for a successor if a president were to die in office, he said. The secretary of state also could perform many of the vice president's functions, he said. `` The secretary of state can sip champagne at diplomatic parties and look somber and dignified at state funerals,'' <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> said. `` The vice president is eminently dispensable.''

<HEAD>Police Arrest Lebanese Gunman After Standoff At Libyan Embassy</HEAD>

 Police ended a nearly 12-hour standoff with an armed Lebanese man barricaded in the Libyan Embassy by rushing in and grabbing the gunman after he had fallen asleep, officials said. No shots were fired in the incident Thursday, and a handful of Libyan embassy employees who had been trapped on the top floors were not injured, police said. Police identified the man as <PERSON> El-Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON>, 22, and said he had escaped from a prison in <LOCATION> Goettingen </LOCATION> on July 8 along with a <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> accomplice who has since been recaptured. <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON> was serving a three-year prison term for assault, police said. For nearly 12 hours police negotiated with <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON>, who pulled out a pistol inside the embassy's first-floor reception room after he was denied a visa for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Embassy employees were able to flee the building quickly or run to the upper floors, leaving <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON> by himself, police said. `` He had become very weak since his escape and looked exhausted during the negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> police team that captured <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>'s team was able to watch <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON> by making use of a video camera that is a normal part of embassy security. At about 9:15 p.m., police noticed <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON> had fallen asleep and they rushed him, <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. `` Finally, he just fell asleep from exhaustion,'' said <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>. `` He did not offer us any resistance.'' Police said they did not know where <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON> got the pistol. <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON> was taken to a local hospital for examination, officials said. A team of police officers negotiated with the gunman for almost 12 hours by telephone as well as through a metal-barred door at the entrance to the structure. `` He demanded that he not be returned to prison. He said he wanted to go to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> because the Libyans always help the Lebanese,'' said <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>. Police spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Classen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. But he said <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> police did not know how long <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON> had lived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, whether he had any relatives in this country or know any other details about the man other than his prison record. <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON> had been at the prison in <LOCATION> Goettingen </LOCATION> for about 18 months, <PERSON> Classen </PERSON> said. Shortly after the standoff began, heavily armed police officers wearing combat gear climbed through a second-story window into the embassy, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Libyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. Those officers guarded access to the upper floors of the five-story building in case <PERSON> Edelbi </PERSON> tried to take hostages from among the employees on the higher floors, <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukhries </PERSON>, head of the embassy, had given police permission to enter the building, <PERSON> Classen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bukhries </PERSON> was able to escape through a side door shortly after the standoff began. Police sealed off the area after embassy employees signaled an alarm shortly before 10 a.m.

 As <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made his way around <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this week, he fell further and further behind schedule, leaving thousands of people who had been invited to see him waiting for hours _ sometimes in vain. The Soviet leader arrived in the western port city of <LOCATION> Sczcecin </LOCATION> on Wednesday already an hour behind schedule, and by the time he reached his first scheduled event, a speech at a shipyard, he was two hours late. Polish authorities, anxious to ensure all went smoothly for their Soviet visitor, had seated the workers nearly two hours ahead of time. So when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> finally arrived, the 3,000 people in the audience were squirming after sitting practically silent on backless wooden benches for four hours. Organizers of the trip kept adding events to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s schedule, including a visit to a private farm on his way to the airport to return to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> It was nearly midnight when the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief arrived back in the capital, just about four hours late. The delay forced cancellation of a special chamber music concert that had been arranged for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, in a palace on the outskirts of the capital. Although most of the unannounced stops had been arranged in advance, with state-run television often set up to record the events, Polish government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> attributed the delays to what he called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s extraordinary popularity among the Polish people. Never before, he said, had a visitor drawn such crowds or generated so much `` spontaneous joy.'' But at all those events reporters were permitted to witness, the crowds were screened in advance, and Polish security often checked peoples' invitations against their identification cards before permitting them within sight of the Soviet leader.

<HEAD>Few Controls On Ingredients, FDA Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans have indicated they would like to see more federal regulation of the $ 17 billion-a-year cosmetic industry, which currently lacks stringent controls, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiermann </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s division of cosmetic technology, said people are often surprised to learn that cosmetics, which usually contain chemicals, have so few federal guidelines. <PERSON> Eiermann </PERSON> made his comments in a telephone interview Thursday after a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee heard testimony about the potential danger of some of the chemicals in cosmetics. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., chairman of the small business panel, said some of the chemicals in cosmetics can cause cancer, birth defects, central nervous disorders, skin and eye irritations and allergic reactions <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> promised to have additional hearings in the fall to weigh whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should take action to enforce additional testing and labeling of cosmetics. About 8,000 chemicals are used in cosmetics and perfume. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> does not have the authority to test cosmetics for safety before they are sold, and can not require manufacturers to provide test data on a product's safety. The only actions <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> can take are to seize contaminated products and to ask manufacturers to change their advertising claims, he said. Retail products sold to consumers must be labeled as to contents, but that regulation does not apply to products sold to business establishments, such as hair styling salons. <PERSON> Eiermann </PERSON> said it is <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' responsibility to decide whether Americans want cosmetics to be subject to the same standards applied to food and drugs. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> did a food survey in the 1970s and included questions about cosmetics. `` There is a preponderance of the population ... they think the products should be regulated,'' he said. Results of the study were never published because they were part of the broader survey, he said. The Cosmetic, Toiletry and <ORGANIZATION> Fragrance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group that represents the industry, said cosmetic companies are committed to safety. `` Because of this commitment, personal care products are among the safest of any consumer products and are used confidently by millions of persons on a daily basis,'' it said in a statement The industry has a program of self-regulation that involves testing ingredients, the statement said. <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should pass legislation requiring that all cosmetic products contain ingredient labels. Secondly, she said, more studies need to be done to determine the long-term effects on people who use the chemicals. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cone </PERSON>, chief of the occupational health clinic at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take steps to warn consumers and beauticians about any possible health hazards in cosmetics. He suggested that products contain detailed labels that clearly spell out the nature of any chemicals in the cosmetics and explain possible health hazards. Moreover, the government should collect better information about the chemicals and their effects and remove any that are deemed dangerous, <PERSON> Cone </PERSON> said.

 At least 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> members, some carrying a casket to symbolize the burial of apartheid, prayed and demonstrated before the South African Embassy to protest that nation's system of racial discrimination. Raising their fists and chanting `` let our people go,'' the demonstrators lifted the gray casket before the embassy entrance, as <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> led the crowd Thursday in a series of prayers that `` hearts might be changed.'' Hooks prayed that `` those white folk in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, that call themselves Christians, may start acting like <PERSON> Christians </PERSON> and recognize that they are their brother's keeper ... that we are all one blood.'' `` We come here today in the spirit of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> ... to say that we wo n't be satisfied until the walls of segregation, apartheid and oppression are brought low in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Guess </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> communications director. `` We come today praying that our own pharaoh, who sits at 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, will hear these voices -LRB- and realize that -RRB- we can not exist in this world, half slave and half free,'' Guess prayed, referring to the White House address. Hooks then pointed to the casket and pronounced sentence on the policies of apartheid, segregation, hatred, racial discrmination, unjust treatment and inequality. He led the crowd in the closing words over the coffin, saying, `` dust to dust, ashes to ashes _ apartheid you'll never rise again!'' The coffin was placed in a white hearse as the demonstrators sang `` Oh, Freedom,'' a song from the civil rights movement. The half-hour march was the culmination of South Africa Day at the 79th annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People.

 The nation's largest private television stations began limiting coverage of guerrilla violence in a bid to encourage peace, and the government prolonged a state of emergency to combat the rebels. Also Thursday, Maoist rebels from the group known as Shining Path shot to death the city administrator of <LOCATION> Chincha </LOCATION>, 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, police said. Television coverage of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s eight-year rebel insurgency had become a battle ground among stations in ratings wars, with some channels dedicating up to 15 minutes a night to violent footage. `` The accord of a minute'' was agreed to by <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> channels 2, 4, 5 and 9 _ most of the city's stations. It calls for the time alloted to local news reports of violence held to 60 seconds per broadcast. Channel 5 press director <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> said the goal of the self-imposed pact was to contribute to national pacification. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> prolonged a state of emergency for two months in the coastal capital of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and parts of six other states in the <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle. The announcement was made in a decree in the official gazette <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peruano </LOCATION>. Police said three Shining Path guerrilla gunmen killed administrator <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Casas </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s center-left <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, near his <LOCATION> Chincha </LOCATION> home and escaped before authorities arrived. The official was leaving home for work. The assassination was carried out like dozens of others by the rebel band against government and party officials. But most of the more than 10,000 people slain during the insurgency have been highland peasants caught in the fighting between guerrillas and government forces. The state of emergency was first imposed in highland <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> two years after the Shining Path, inspired by the late <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Zedong </PERSON>, launched its insurgency there in 1980 to topple <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government and install Marxist rule. A state of emergency suspends citizens' rights to meet publicly and travel freely, while permitting government forces to conduct searches without warrants and hold suspects for long periods before filing charges.

<HEAD>Tax Bill Gives Breaks to Mail Carriers, Pistachio Growers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pistachio growers, mail carriers and freelance writers are in for tax breaks under a bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Some farmers, moonlighters and pipe smokers will help pick up the tab. After a month of off-and-on work behind closed doors, the committee on Thursday voted 33-3 for a package providing $ 7.1 billion in specialized tax relief over the next three years. Because of budget restrictions the bill also carries the tax increases to pay for the cuts. The bill originally was designed solely to correct hundreds of errors that showed up in the landmark tax overhaul enacted in 1986. But since this is the only tax bill with a chance of passing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year, committee members ended up adding numerous amendments extending some expiring tax benefits and dozens of others providing relief to specialized groups of taxpayers. For example, the bill would allow an 80 percent tax deduction for contributions to college athletic scholarship funds when such `` gifts'' guarantee a fan the privilege of buying a game ticket. Because the bill would raise other taxes on some people, there is enough controversy associated with it to make enactment far less than certain. For one thing, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes some of the increases. Too, there is some doubt that Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, will interrupt his vice presidential campaign to handle a bill that raises taxes on anybody. Some of the dozens of provisions in the bill would: _ Allow rural mail carriers to deduct 33.75 cents for each mile a personal car is driven on a mail route; most people are allowed just 22.5 cents a mile for business-related mileage _ Give certain producers of pistachio nuts a break on how they account for production costs _ Exempt freelance writers, artists and photographers from a new requirement that they deduct expenses of an endeavor only after it starts producing income _ Impose a tax of $ 2.67 per pound of pipe tobacco; that is equivalent to the existing 16-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes _ Tighten depreciation provisions for single-purpose farm structures, such as poultry houses, and farm machinery _ Prohibit any person with a home-based business -LRB- including moonlighters -RRB- from deducting any part of the base monthly telephone charge as a business expense _ Renew at a reduced level the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance Only $ 1,500 of such aid per year could avoid tax, down from $ 5,250. _ Extend several expiring provisions, including credits for research and experimentation and for owners of low-income rental housing and a tax exemption for bonds used to help lower-income families buy their first home _ Relieve farmers from a 1987 requirement that they pay tax on off-road diesel fuel and then apply for a refund _ Allow owners of mutual fund shares to deduct certain fund expenses without regard to the usual 2 percent floor under miscellaneous deductions _ Remove some tax benefits from single-premium life insurance policies _ Raise taxes on various corporations, including those that own parts of other corporations and defense contractors _ Assure that fellowships created to honor the memory of Challenger astronaut <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> are tax-free so long as the recipient teacher uses the money for academic improvement _ Permit operators of offshore or <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil rigs and of some commercial vessels -LRB- but not luxury liners -RRB- to deduct the full cost of meals provided to employees; most business may deduct only 80 percent _ Allow a surviving spouse to defer taxation on certain profits from the sale of a principal home, just as though the spouse had not died Present law denies such a break if a spouse dies after a home is sold and before a new one is built.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans say they'll `` make no effort'' to wage a floor fight for <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON>, a conservative appellate court nominee whose writings were cited as too extreme to win Democratic backing. In a vote that had similarities to the rejection last year of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, the Democratic-led <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 8-6 along party lines Thursday to recommend <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejection of <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON>. The professor of constitutional law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nominee for the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, covering nine Western states. Like <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON> wrote often on the law, and _ like <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> _ his views often were contrary to precedents set by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, especially on civil rights and civil liberties. But while senators decided a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee deserved a full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote, even <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON>'s supporters said no such effort would be made for him. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, whose motion to report the nomination without recommendation failed on a 7-7 tie, said afterwards that Republicans `` will make no effort to take it to the floor. It's obvious that it's over.'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, R-Utah and another <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON> supporter, agreed that there would be no floor fight. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>. first voted for rejection, but then sided with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> no-recommendation motion Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., who offered the motion to reject <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON>, criticized the nominee's almost total lack of experience before federal courts _ he had one case three decades ago _ and said the nominee practiced `` judicial activism in the extreme. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., agreed that <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON>'s writings were `` extreme'' but voted for him anyway, arguing a law professor should have freedom to write what he chooses <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, who opposed <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, said he would be more concerned about <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON>'s views if he were a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee. An appellate court candidate would have no choice but to follow <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings, he said _ a point <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON> made in two confirmation hearings. <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON> wrote that prayer in schools could be constitutional, although the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has said otherwise. He contended that equal weight should be given to property rights and human rights. He said framers of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees basic freedoms, never intended its scope to be as broad as that defined by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON> also disagreed with the high court's reasoning in its 1954 decision outlawing school segregation, although he agreed with the result. The landmark ruling, <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON> said, should have been based on the right of black students to travel to the schools of their choice. His critics said this would have left students at the schoolhouse door, without guaranteeing a seat inside. <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON>, 63, was only the second judicial nominee to be rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since the Democrats regained control in January 1987. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> was the first. Although the two men disagreed on some areas of the law, both wrote often from their positions as law school scholars. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> went on to become a federal appellate judge, although he resigned after his defeat for the high court. <PERSON> Siegan </PERSON>, after a state court practice, went on to become a professor. His lack of federal court experience was cited by Democrats opposing him. `` He has n't handled a case since I was 12 years old _ 36 years ago,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> has jurisdiction over <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mariana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>.

The measure was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where there could be floor action before mid-August. The decision by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to tap <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate heightens prospects for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of the legislation, in the view of some Democrats. In related action, a legislative blueprint for implementing the U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement won approval Thursday from the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The plan also cleared the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Tariffs between the two nations would be phased out over the next 10 years under the agreement. Under special procedures reserved for international trade pacts, the administration will now introduce implementing legislation that follows closely the blueprint drawn up by the two committees. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guarantees in turn that the legislation gets speeded up consideration, with amendments ruled out. Administration officials promised the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the legislation would not include subsidies for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> uranium industry, which had been delaying action by the two committees. Both <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., balked at the uranium subsidy plan Other squabbles also were settled and officials said the path appeared clear for approval of the agreement and the bill. `` We've set an example for the entire world on what can be accomplished with free trade,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` This is a historic moment.'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> issued a statement saying the lawmakers had `` reached agreement among ourselves and with the administration on the details of the implementing legislation.'' `` I believe that this consultative process has developed a sound, well crafted implementing bill, which balances all interests,'' he said. `` It fully carries out our obligations under the agreement but also protects the legitimate intrerests of those few industries concerned about possible adverse effects on their current business dealings,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet teams monitoring compliance with the new medium-range missile treaty have found no violations of the pact so far, says Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, head of the American inspection contingent. `` There have been no difficulties,'' <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, the chief of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, headed a team on the first round of American on-site visits to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the beginning of this month, and was expected to begin the second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> round over the weekend. Four Soviet teams of 10 people arrived Thursday evening aboard a special Ilyushin-62 at <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and were to begin their second round of inspections today or Saturday. The sites the Soviets were expected to visit were a <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant near <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Redstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>; and possibily the <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet inspectors were a little wary at first, said <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, the process has gone smoothly since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> exchanged articles of ratification in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on June 1 and the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty went into effect. During a 60-day period of `` baseline inspections,'' the Soviets are visiting 30 sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> and his team are inspecting 133 sites in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, to determine the accuracy of data exchanged by the two sides. Under the treaty, which calls for elimination of all superpower missiles with ranges of 340 miles to 3,000 miles over about three years, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is to destroy about 6,000 items, consisting of missiles and related components, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to destroy 2,000 items, <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> said. With inspections about 25 percent complete, said <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, `` the count has been exactly on.'' `` Inspectors tend to be congenitally suspicious, which is probably a healthy attitude,'' he said. `` Both sides are wary that the other will be concealing or hiding items. That has not been the case on either side.'' The on-site inspectors are confined to strictly defined areas and do not have the right to roam through woods or caves looking for hidden missiles. `` There are other sources that hopefully will give us the confidence there is not something'' in areas inspectors can not visit, said <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, alluding to satellites which take photographs and collect electronic intelligence. `` It is too early in the life of this treaty to be philosophic or to make grand pronouncements,'' he added. But <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, who has served twice as military attache in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and once in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, said `` there are some dramatic differences in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from when I was there, leaving for the last time in 1983, and the relationship I had with the Group of Soviet Forces in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from'83 to'86.'' <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1985 when <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldiers fatally shot Maj. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> while the soldier visited <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and `` clearly there was a considerable tension in our relationship. All of that is gone now.'' The Soviets, under severe pressure from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, apologized last month for shooting <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Gap Grows Between Religious `Believers and Belongers'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The number of Americans who believe in the divinity of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> has increased in the last decade, but a smaller percentage belong to organized churches, according to a new Gallup Poll. `` The churches of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have made no headway in narrowing the gap between religious belief and church involvement, between believers and belongers,'' said the polling organization's co-chairman, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallup </PERSON>, in previewing the survey results Thursday The nationwide survey, called `` The Unchurched American,'' found that 84 percent of those surveyed believe <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> is either God or the son of God, compared with 78 percent in a similar 1978 Gallup Poll. The number of survey respondents declaring they were `` committed to Jesus Christ'' increased from 60 percent to 66 percent. Forty-four percent of respondents were classified as `` unchurched'' because they have not attended regular services in six months, compared with 40 percent of those polled a decade ago. The survey projects that 61 million American adults did not belong to any church in 1978, with the number increasing to 78 million today. While churchgoers tend to have stronger beliefs than those who do not attend, the survey found considerable `` faith'' among the unchurched, <PERSON> Gallup </PERSON> said at a news conference. The poll showed that 72 percent of those who do not attend church believe in Christ, 77 percent believe in God, 63 percent believe the Bible is inspired, 58 percent believe in an afterlife and 25 percent say they have had a `` religious experience.'' The $ 163,000 study, based on in-person interviews with 2,556 adults, was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, for 22 major religious organizations and is to be distributed at a National Festival of Evangelism in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Aug. 4-7. Gallup said the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, making the 10-year change in results on church participation and religious belief statistically significant. `` One might maintain that churches have done well to keep slippage at a minimum in view of the continued high mobility among Americans during the last decade, the distractions of modern life, and the apparent growing appeal of cults and non-traditional religious movements,'' Gallup said. The percentage of all respondents who said they believe that most churches are too concerned with organizational rather than spiritual issues has grown from 51 percent in 1978 to 59 percent in the new survey. And, 41 percent said they believe churches are not concerned enough about social justice, compared to 35 percent in the previous survey. Gallup said the survey found more criticism of churches from those who attend than those who do not, but he did not give details. Complete survey results are to be released at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> convention. There was no significant change over the 10-year period in the view held by more than three-fourths of those surveyed that a person can be a good Christian or Jew without attending a church or synagogue. In both surveys, about 80 percent also said they believe that a person `` should arrive at his or her religious beliefs independent of any church or synagogue.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> conference, said the survey results showed little differences in opinions between Protestants and Catholics. He said it was not possible to break down the results by denominations because the individual samplings were not large enough. He said religious leaders have yet to analyze the survey results but they seem to indicate that while church membership has sagged, Americans are `` deeply religious and the churches have a tremendous opportunity to reach out.'' `` Many times we churches are only concerned about our needs and become self-centered and ingrown,'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> said. The poll interviewed more blacks and Hispanics than the percentages existing in the general population in order to find if there were any significant differences in responses by race, <PERSON> Gallup </PERSON> said. It found no relationship between race and church status or religious values, he said, but more black respondents said they had `` real religious experiences,'' believed more strongly in personal freedom, and were critical of churches for inadequate commitment to social justice.

<HEAD>Sighs of Relief by Delegates and Nation as Surveys Come to an End</HEAD>

 The political survey season is coming mercifully to an end for the 6,438 Democratic and Republican convention delegates who have had to endure 1,001 questions from the news media. And so, too, for the rest of us who've suffered the cumulative results. Is there a collective national amen? The delegates, chosen by their fellow party members to pick candidates for president and vice president, were telephoned, polled, interviewed, prodded, bothered, analyzed, classified, categorized, pigeonholed, sorted, shuffled and mostly picked clean for their opinions by newspapers, wire services, radio and television. Then they were dissected by age, sex, race, voting record, ethnicity, religion, region, income, education, height, weight and pet ownership. As in, tall, red-haired female college graduates who own <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> can be counted for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Or, perhaps, the other way around. It was a Herculean task, draining considerable media talent, for there are 4,161 delegates to next week's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> and 2,277 to next month's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> bash in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The survey effort, which started with the selection of the first <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Republican delegates in January, cries out for a summing up. What made you hate surveys? How many calls did you get? How much time did you spend on them? Whose survey did you like best, whose least and what was the dumbest question you were asked, present company excepted? `` I think questions about my race, religion and sex would be illegal if the government asked them,'' said Republican delegate <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, the top aide to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> governor <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` If we in government asked those questions they would be considered insulting or suspect.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> handled survey questions for his boss, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>. `` Surveys have ranged from one paragraph to what look like <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> grand inquisitions,'' was his answer to the survey of surveys. The longest, he said, was the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times which spread its 132 questions over 16 pages and `` you virtually need a Ph.D. and two weeks time to answer that survey.'' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> was asked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' strongest point. `` His record as governor.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' weakest point? `` His record as governor,'' said <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>. Of such stuff are trends discerned. `` There must be at least 50 surveys,'' said <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pajcic </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegate. `` It seems to me there is more inefficiency in the media than there is in government.'' Some people do exaggerate. `` There were too many surveys,'' groused <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> state Democratic party vice chairman. `` You get some that are 15 and 20 minutes long. That's crazy.'' <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Covilli </PERSON>, 61, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was bothered by the 20 or so interviewers who would n't accept her insistence on being uncommitted. `` Who's your choice? Who's your choice?'' she mimicked. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Representative <PERSON> Monique </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate, was irritated by the `` what-if'' questions about vice presidential possibilities. `` Finally, I just told one guy: Put down <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> every time you get to that question.'' Delegate <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Canino </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat who works for the state welfare department, was reluctant to answer questions. Then she was n't crazy about question No. 1, her age. Then she wanted to know if the questions had been cleared by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Then she hung up. Congressman <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, accustomed to interviews, was willing to answer questions until he found out it was a survey. `` I'm not doing any of these,'' he said and hung up. Some delegates, it must be said, were flattered by the attention and said things like `` Thank you for asking my opinion.'' The survey of surveys failed to ask whether it was their first interview or the 15th. As for the dumbest question, there were several candidates. `` How much money I plan to spend in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a super delegate from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` What was it in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> that I wanted to see more than anything before I left,'' said <PERSON> Monique </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the indomitable <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate. Her reply: `` I told them, ` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as the vice president or the president.'''

 Eight years after <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in defeat and despair, his long political exile is coming to an end here in his native <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. No longer is he shunned by the Democratic establishment or scorned as the hapless leader who turned over the keys of the White House to Republican <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. With the Democratic convention threatened by discord, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to mediate his high-profile differences with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He has earned respect of all of us,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> explained. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he wants <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to play `` a real role'' in settling the differences. `` He understands the equation,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> will deliver an opening-night speech before the Democratic convention on Monday. He is hosting receptions for the media, former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members and other dignitaries. And, the Carter Presidential Center will be the site for many convention-related activities, such as forums on domestic and foreign policy issues. At long last, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> is an undisputed elder statesman of the party. Democratic chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said Americans have changed their opinion about <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> after `` eight years of three-by-five cards and hands-off government'' under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` People understand the sincerity and the seriousness of purpose and the enlightment of values and views that President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> brought to his administration,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. `` And I think he will be greeted and welcomed at the Democratic convention as he should be _ just as a president whose roots were planted and nutured here in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> but who made a great contribution to values around the globe,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. Those must be sweet words to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, particularly since they come from a man who wanted to see Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., not <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee for president in 1980 It has n't been easy for <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> turned him out of office in 1980, humiliating him with a 44-state sweep. Even after losing the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> remained a favorite target of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Republicans, blamed for the sagging economy and ridiculed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for talking about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` malaise.'' For a long while, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was remembered as the president who left American hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the leader who authorized a rescue attempt that ended in failure in the desert. He presided over a nation that waited in long lines for gasoline and had to pay double-digit interest rates for loans. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has had his setbacks, too: 242 servicemen killed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, record budget deficits, the Iran-Contra scandal and, most recently, the picture of an American warship shooting down a civilian airliner over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, killing 290 people. Perhaps these events have softened the Republican-promoted image of <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as inept. On the campaign trail, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, certain to be the Republican presidential nominee, is likely to pass over <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and talk about `` <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> Democrats.'' A relationship with <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has proven not to be a political liability, as evidenced by the election successes of former administration members such as <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s secretary of transportation, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who won a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador who now is mayor of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Though <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s name is not frequently invoked by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, all of the Democrats who ran for president _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> included _ made a pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to pay respects this year. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s success is in marked contrast to that of another former president, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Fourteen years after <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> resigned in disgrace, he still avoids the Republican presidential conventions and plays only a backstage role in offering occasional advice to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

 Black leaders say it is urgent that Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> heal his rift with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the man he defeated, and they predict next week's party convention could be `` on the wild and ragged side.'' `` There has to be a real healing process set in motion,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, adding that he would try to play a role in reconciling the two sides in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` I'm concerned that the black community not feel that in snubbing Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has snubbed them,'' Hooks said. `` Up to now the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign has been healthy for the Democratic party, and I see no reason why it should n't continue to be healthy,'' said <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. Black members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> planned a series of meetings for this weekend and early next week aimed at reconciling the party's split factions. Sessions were being set first with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to develop a unified strategy, then with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or his top aide, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>. `` Clearly the way <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was dealt with, on a personal basis, looms as a monumental issue,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` It speaks to how black people are perceived in this election He is the personification of the hopes of millions of people. Whether Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> understands that or not is something that remains to be seen.'' <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> said the snub gives the appearance that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is courting conservatives who have been fickle to the Democratic party and taking for granted the black voters who have been its most loyal supporters. Several black leaders said they expect the path to reconciliation to be rocky, and Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill., vowed to stage several protests, including a Monday march from the grave of slain civil rights leader Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to the Omni convention center `` I think there's going to be a lot of confusion down in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a lot of pain down there,'' <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> said. Added Hooks: `` It will be a little on the wild and ragged side. But we'll leave there together.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his supporters were stung by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for the vice presidential spot on the Democratic ticket, and the hurt was compounded when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> first learned about the choice from reporters rather than directly from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Wednesday to try to mend the damage, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Thursday he had asked former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to mediate between the two camps. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said he got an apology from a top <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide but no apology from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He said he was n't seeking one, though. The lawmakers said their concerns extended beyond the personal tiff to the appearance that issues of concern to blacks were being given short shrift. `` We are trying to salvage this,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledging that there is a wide range of intensity about the matter among the 23 black House members who make up the caucus. `` We are practical politicians.'' Some caucus members said they recognized the danger to their political standing if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appears to be going to the convention purely as a spoiler, and <PERSON> Young </PERSON> hinted that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should be ready to compromise. `` This party has elected <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as its nominee,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` His primary responsibility is to bring victory. He ca n't do anything for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or for me or the cities unless he wins election.'' The black caucus was working through Rep. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>, D-Mass., to set up meetings with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp, and <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> said he expected there to be a lengthy meeting, perhaps on Tuesday `` I think it would be a very wise idea on the part of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people,'' <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> said. `` They can talk at length about problems, about issues. And if they want, they can talk about the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> thing. ... I would like very much if we could have a nice, good, normal, united convention.'' <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> said the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> `` play a very key role. We need them with us. I think most of them want this settled.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, back from a look at what he called the `` worst natural disaster since the Dust Bowl,'' is sending a team headed by Secretary of Agriculture <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> on a tour of 11 drought-stricken states from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> inspected corn and soybean fields in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on Thursday and appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to focus its attention on drought relief, putting aside partisanship and efforts to rewrite the overall farm laws. `` Politics must stop at the parched field's edge,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, paraphrasing a traditional foreign policy slogan that partisanship should stop at the water's edge. The president spoke at a luncheon in <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION> after inspecting crop damage at the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quoin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> grounds and the nearby farm of <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Krone </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` We should keep our eye on the ball,'' he told the luncheon audience. `` Drought relief should be just that, drought relief.'' Both in <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION> and at the fair grounds, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged the lawmakers to avoid amendments not relevant to the drought crisis. `` What I saw was not a pretty sight,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said after walking through the shriveled fields and viewing them from a helicopter. `` We ca n't make it rain but we can help to ease the pain, and that's what the federal government will do,'' he told state agriculture officials and farmers gathered at the fair grounds. `` From <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and right here in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, farmers face the worst natural disaster since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s,'' the president said. On Air Force One flying back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said he and his task force plan to visit 11 states, beginning next Tuesday. He listed <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. He said he would be accompanied by representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> and several other agencies. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 5.5 billion drought relief bill after adopting 10 amendments. The corresponding committee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is considering a similar bill. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> told reporters that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill appeared to be `` pretty close to the package we've been talking about.'' In <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke at a luncheon sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> WOC </ORGANIZATION> and the local chamber of commerce after taking part in 65th anniversary observances of the station, where he began his entertainment career as an announcer in the 1930s. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> WOC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he is waiting for the farm relief bill. `` I will sign it the minute it is delivered to me,'' he said.

 Nobody really expected <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to go gently into the campaign to win the White House for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s grievances against the Democrat who defeated him were inevitable. For <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, it's too soon to have them settled. Without his complaints _ notably <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' failure to give him advance word that Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would be the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee _ there would be nothing but symbolism to keep the campaign going. And <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has gone far beyond symbolism in his second campaign for the presidency. In defeat, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has risen higher in the realm of presidential politics than any black man before him. He is not ready to end his campaign quite yet. So as his convention cavalcade rolls from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on a final campaign bus tour, he is demanding a clear and influential role in the campaign and in the councils of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he'll have one. `` I want <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to be deeply involved in the campaign as a party leader,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. `` I hope and expect that he will be.'' Neither has defined the precise nature of the role or the deep involvement. Precision is difficult if not impossible anyhow. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he is not satisfied. `` We are prepared to deliberate and debate Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday,'' he said, accounting for all the business sessions of the Democratic National Convention. Lacking the vice presidential slights _ he is n't it and he was n't told of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would have had to find other issues for debate, or lapse into silence, which is not his way. Now he's even involving innocent bystanders, as in the suggestion that former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> mediate his differences with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> declined to comment on that notion. The eventual settlement will be the drama of the Democratic National Convention opening Monday, with all its decisions made in advance. Debate is one thing; delegates are another. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has more than 2,500 to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1,150. Any time delegates vote, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is in control. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s claim that the floor will be `` wide open'' on a vice presidential nomination simply is n't so, on any item of business. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needs to claim his victory and enforce his decisions without alienating the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces, doubly difficult and also crucial, because he is dealing with a black leader and a predominantly black constituency. `` Presently, I do not know the proposed strategy to win,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Thursday. `` At this point, my constituency has no place on the team.'' That constituency can not be turned on and off at will, not even by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s command. This time the unity show that is the traditional convention finale will have to be built on a base more substantive than handshakes and victory waves. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s supporters are echoing and escalating the complaint that he heard from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> choice only after it had been made public. `` It speaks to the way black people are perceived in this election,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` Whether Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> understands that or not is something that remains to be seen. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was sorry he had n't been able to contact everybody in advance, and noted that he had not reached <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, either. He has talked with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by telephone at least twice since announcing the <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> selection. The nominee-in-waiting is trying to be conciliatory without appearing to surrender control of the convention and the party he now leads. He needs <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s help _ and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> needs a continuing role in the 1988 campaign. This is, after all, only the preliminary. The real prize will be awarded on Nov. 8, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> versus Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The real test of whatever reconciliation <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reach wo n't come in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. It will come in the campaign months that follow.

<HEAD>Dukakis Turns Attention To State Budget Crunch</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 State budget problems are dogging <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the days before he travels to the Democratic National Convention to receive his party's presidential nomination. While most of his headquarters campaign staff made a wholesale move to the convention site in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent most of the day in a search for ways to deal with deficits in budgets for the current and past fiscal years. The governor and his fellow Democrats who dominate the state legislature were determined to resolve the budget problems before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> heads for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Sunday and deny Republicans an opportunity to attack the Democratic candidate's claim to be an efficient manager. `` The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> express is rolling,'' <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said during the legislative budget debate. `` You Democrats want out of here. You do n't -LRB- care -RRB- what happens to the budget.'' Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has clinched the Republican presidential nomination, already has attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for approving more than $ 100 million in new taxes as part of a budget-balancing plan. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was trying to clear his desk of state problems, he also was confronted by threats to his goal of a party convention that will reflect party unity. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, saying `` I simply want respect and responsibility,'' suggested that former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> step in and mediate differences between the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camps. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for mediation, said only that the two sides had been talking throughout the campaign and would keep doing so. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had spoken with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by telephone, but would not comment on whether he would get involved in any mediation effort. Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his aides minimized the prospect that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s displeasure over the handling of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate would endanger party unity But as he left <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on a bus caravan for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> refused to rule out the possibility of a convention challenge to the choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Later, however, after his caravan arrived in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` We hope in the next three or four days that matters will be resolved.'' And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, asked during a CBS interview if he expected a display of unity in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> that would include <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said `` I expect that you will.'' `` Democratic conventions seldom begin on a note of unity,'' said senior <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign aide <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. `` But in recent years they have ended on one.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as he has done in the past, took a tough line toward <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s complaints about his vice presidential selection process. `` Obviously in a contest like this somebody wins and somebody loses and I'm the guy who's won and it's my job to go out and pick a running mate,'' he said in the CBS interview. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> complained that he was n't notified in advance of the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and learned of it from a reporter. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman, said the nominee-to-be called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` The governor obviously made it clear that it was his own intention for the Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and all of the candidates to hear the news from no one else but the governor,'' he said. <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> declined to say whether the governor had apologized. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> termed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' gesture an `` important call and a good start'' toward healing relations, but made it clear he expects there will be a number of conversations between the two men in the days ahead. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' only public foray outside the statehouse on Thursday was a visit to two state troppers recovering from gunshot wounds suffered in a drug raid. Outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, using a police cruiser as a table, signed legislation toughening sentences for people convicted of possession of cocaine. `` We're serious about a war on drugs in this state,'' said the governor, sounding a familiar campaign theme.

<HEAD>Politics Played No Part In Bush's UN Appearance, Aides Insist</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is satisfied with his appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on the accidental <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of an Iranian airliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, but aides are reluctant to say whether he will reap political advantage. But while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his supporters insist that political considerations did not figure in his Thursday appearance, the assignment did provide the vice president with a high-profile forum. `` Any time you can go and speak forcefully about bringing peace to this part of the world, it's worth doing,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. `` He did n't do it for political reasons. I do not believe it will be harmful politically.'' After an angry 1 -LCB- - hour denunciation of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali-Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> for `` barbaric acts,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the world organization the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> felt grief for the loss of innocent lives that `` transcends political differences and boundaries. But he also condemned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for allowing a civilian airliner carrying 290 people `` to proceed on a path over a warship engaged in battle'' and said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must share responsibility for the tragedy. Coming days before Democrats convene in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to install <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as their presidential nominee, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appearance gave him high visibility in an area that he is presenting as one of his strong suits: foreign policy. Still, it was the first time that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been selected to address the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in his 7 -LCB- years as vice president, even though he served there as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador under President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in the early 1970s. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had decided to give him the assignment `` to put some real emphasis on the policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by elevating the level of representation.'' `` There's so much at stake, I'm not sure people have a heart for talking about how it helps him politically,'' said campaign press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. `` This was serious business, it was n't politics. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> more subdued in his <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> presentation than he has been in recent public appearances when he characterized the July 3 disaster as `` just an unhappy incident'' while telling audiences that `` life goes on.'' Departing from his prepared text, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned to face <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> across the semi-circular council table. Speaking in a calm voice, the vice president said: `` Of course we feel badly about it, of course we have compassion. Of course we care.'' Aides said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presentation was written by three or four White House speechwriters, with most of the ideas for its wording coming from him. The text was coordinated with both the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivered it, the aides said. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, his chief of staff, would not confirm speculation that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself had proposed the assignment to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying only that he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had worked out the arrangements. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> told reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> II after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appearance that the vice president `` feels very good about'' the way his 20-minute address to the world forum came across. It was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s last scheduled public appearance until next Wednesday, when he begins a six-day campaign swing. He has no public events planned for today, and on Saturday he leaves for a 4 -LCB- - day fishing trip at a remote, undisclosed location in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a close friend and adviser <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday also gave his first public reaction to the naming by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as former rival Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate, beyond a cryptic `` that's interesting'' on the day of the announcement. He called the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` an unusual choice'' but told reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two he did not think it would hurt him politically, even in his adopted state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a 1970 Senate race. Asked if the selection would make him campaign harder for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' 29 electoral votes, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know I certainly wo n't lighten up. `` I plan to spend a lot of time in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> anyway. I am certainly not going to take <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for granted and I will win <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' `` The race is going to be determined, as I said in 1980 and as I said in 1984, by the top of the ticket. That's what will determine it in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and elsewhere.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is predicting that he and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will triumph over Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this fall in the vice president's adopted home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But he's not claiming it will be easy. `` I think it will be close. I think it will be tough, but I think we'll win it,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said Thursday. `` Vamos a ver,'' he said _ Spanish for `` We're going to see.'' One new poll suggested that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate went down well with Texans. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pulled even with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the state after picking <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday night. Its poll of 580 registered voters on Tuesday and Wednesday found 48 percent supporting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to 44 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. With a margin of error of four percentage points, that is statistically a dead hea. Polls that were taken before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had found a big <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> deferred to his new political partner on Thursday on the matter of mending the rift with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who had lobbied for the vice presidential nomination. `` I know he -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- has a high regard for Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. I assume he'll have a meeting with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in a session with reporters from his home state. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he believed he was chosen as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate because of his legislative experience `` which exposes you to so many facets of this country of ours,'' his proven ability to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and his exposure through the years to various heads of state. A senator since 1970, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is being opposed in his re-election bid this year by Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, a Republican who has been fighting an uphill battle in the race. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is legally allowed to run for both races under a law passed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that allowed <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to run for vice president with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> could remove his name from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ballot before Sept. 6, but the Democrats could not replace him. <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> says <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s dual candidacy is unethical. If <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> wins both elections, he would have to choose one post or the other. If he gave up his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, as expected, Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> would name an interim senator and then call a special election to pick someone to complete the six-year term. Already, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> politicians were moving to stake out a possible candidacy in the event of such a special election. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobby </PERSON> said he would `` certainly seriously consider'' running if such a special election takes place. State Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> also said he'd consider a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> already had been looking at a 1990 race against Republican Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>. Among other Democrats looking to enter the fray are former Gov. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and Reps. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> also has expressed interest. On the Republican side, Reps. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> have shown interest. The 1961 special election to replace <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> drew more than 70 candidates. Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> won.

<BYLINE>Army Engineers Reject Diversion of Great Lakes Water to
Mississippi</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> says it turned down a request for emergency diversion of Great Lakes water to the drought-depleted <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> because the action would do little to help shipping. The decision was based on analysis of water flow and economic considerations, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for civil works, after testifying Thursday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> merchant marine subcommittee. `` It was not politically motivated,'' Page said. Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and other officials whose states have an economic stake in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> asked last month for an increase in water flow from the lakes to the river from 3,000 cubic feet per second to 10,000 cubic feet per second. They asked that the increased flow continue for 100 days. The officials said increasing the flow would enable barge traffic to resume movement down the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. The river's level has fallen because of the drought, and some 3,000 barges were reported stranded as a result. Barge shippers have estimated losses as a result of the stalled shipping at up to $ 60 million. But Page said increasing the outflow to 10,000 cubic feet per second would not do much to help <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> navigation, and shoals would continue to impede the flow of goods. `` We will still have flow'' on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'' through the summer, he said. `` We see in the foreseeable future based on our forecast we do n't need -LRB- increased diversion -RRB- at all.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Vonnahme </PERSON>, director of water resources for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency had no problems with the decision. `` If they feel the waters would n't do any good, then we certainly would n't want to take them out of the lake,'' he said. Great Lakes state senators praised the decision. The corps' position `` gives us more ammunition in the continuing struggle to prevent any diversion,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat. `` I have maintained that we should explore alternatives to diversion, such as lightening the loads on barges or utilizing truck or rail for transporting goods.'' Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat, said `` this decision will let us protect our water, conserve it, and use it in the proper ways in the future.'' The governors of four Great Lakes states opposed the diversion, and only <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> supported it among the leaders of the eight states surrounding the lakes. Canadian officials also protested the proposed diversion. Supporters of diversion argued the increased flow out of the lakes would have a minuscule impact on the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> but would have great benefits downriver. Opponents argued that the lakes water was needed in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION>, increasing diversion would set an unacceptable precedent, and the federal government could not increase diversion without the concurrence of all eight governors of Great Lakes states.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appears all but certain to sign a disaster bill containing payments of up to $ 100,000 for drought-stricken farmers, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman says. `` The prospects are virtual certitude that there will be a drought bill,'' Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said Thursday after the committee approved a blueprint that could cost up to $ 7 billion or even more `` We assured the president that we would stay within the budget and we will,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said after touring drought-stricken <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> cornfields with Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> that he was `` a little edgy'' about proposed amendments that flooded into the Agriculture Committees Wednesday night. But he said he stood ready to approve the basic legislation. `` I will sign it the minute it is delivered to me,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in an interview on radio station <ORGANIZATION> WOC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. He said in a speech that lawmakers should not use the bill as an excuse to rewrite farm programs. `` Drought relief should be just that, drought relief,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Partisanship should be kept out of the issue of drought relief. Politics must stop at the parched field's edge.'' The government, meanwhile, declared <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> disaster areas because of the drought, making farmers in those states eligible for emergency low-interest loans, officials from both states said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayley </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the disaster designation had been requested by the governors of the two states. Other states logged as of Thursday for official designation were: <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., said at a news conference that best-guess estimates placed the cost of aid to crop growers at around $ 5.5 billion and to livestock producers at $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion Overall drought costs, however, could be considerably higher than that, with farm analysts saying the cost of an avalanche of federal crop insurance claims alone could reach $ 1 billion. The bill would provide farmers with disaster payments capped at $ 100,000 for 65 percent of pre-drought expected earnings on crop losses in excess of 35 percent of their historical yields. And both committees are studying ways to enrich the formula a bit for the hardest hit farmers in the Grain Belt. In putting on the finishing touches, senators added special provisions that could aid key industries. One such plan would allow corn refiners who produce ethanol fuel to buy corn from federal stocks at 110 percent of the government's cost of acquisition Influenced by drought, crop prices have skyrocketed since much of the corn was acquired. Under the bill, ethanol producers could buy up to 2 million bushels each every month. Senators said the bill's costs could be offset by government savings, primarily a reduction in deficiency payments due to the drought. These payments to growers of wheat, corn, cotton, rice and a few other crops represent the difference between the value of a farmer's harvest at the market and its value at a so-called target price set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The budget calls for $ 17 billion in spending by the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for deficiency payments and price-support loans. But the market price of corn is now more than the target price and that would automatically mean a dramatic slash in program costs the market prices held for the rest of the year. Even if not, though, the cost to the government is going to be much smaller than expected. Estimates of the savings range from $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion. Many farmers, however, already have received up to 40 percent of their deficiency payments in advance and, unless rescued by legislation, will have to refund all or part at a time when they have much reduced income. The bill would allow them to keep what they have received in advance. Emergency feed programs for livestock producers would be expanded and capped at $ 50,000 for each individual, and a planned 50-cent per hundredweight cut in dairy price supports set for next year would be called off.

<HEAD>`Have a Beer For Us,' Satisfied Party Chief Tells Construction
Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The construction crews are still at work, but the hall where <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will claim his Democratic presidential nomination next week is complete enough for party officials to begin to breathe easier. Easy enough, anyway, to feel assured the whole thing will be in place by Monday's opening gavel and easy enough to bring the construction workers into the delegates' chairs Thursday for a little ceremonial ribbon-cutting. `` When you're at home watching this convention, having a Bud or whatever, have one for us,'' Democratic party chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> told the assembled workers, who were treated to plastic-wrapped sandwiches on the floor of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s Omni Coliseum. `` Do n't take for granted it was just another day's work,'' he said. `` It's a page in history.'' The towering walls of podiums, risers, camera platforms and network studios inside what is otherwise home for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team are impressive. But the built-in features are so big that the hall itself _ cramped anyway by arena standards _ seems amazingly small. In fact, the convention floor is n't big enough. More than half the 4,212 delegates will be in bleachers halfway up the side of the arena. The inside of the hall looks like nothing if not a television set. That is basically what it is. `` I approached it from that standpoint,'' said <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> television set designer who planned the convention interior. <PERSON> Lagler </PERSON> also came up with the color scheme. He says it's red, white and blue, but to others it looks like pink, gray and pale blue _ colors that the party officials say will look less harsh on television screens. `` On camera the whole thing will look red, white and blue,'' he said. `` Just squint: that's what it will look like on television.'' Some squinters, however, found the colors remained pink, gray and pale blue. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> showed off the fancy moveable podium sections. They are controlled with hydraulic lifts by a stage manager who will sit behind the speakers _ and adjust to compensate for the speaker's height. Nominee-to-be <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is five foot eight. Overhead, lights swiveled by remote control, as they will when the convention begins, and canned music poured from giant speakers that were sniffed by bomb-detecting dogs before they were lifted overhead. For delegates in seats so remote they ca n't see, giant television screens will provide a view. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, the convention's director of communications, said that while all looks pretty close to completion, there are constant demands for adjustments. `` I walked in here yesterday and thought, ` My Lord, they're not going to be ready,''' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. `` But they've done a lot in two days.'' Even as the ribbon was cut, however, television microwave receivers were still being installed above studio `` skyboxes'' that allow anchor people to look down on the whole spectacle. There was a din of resumed hammering and sawing. A workman in shorts scaled a rope ladder and crawled along a suspension system near the 12-story-high ceiling, adjusting the focus of lights to please technicians below. Just off the floor is the <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION>' office, where general manager <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> declared the hall unrecognizable. `` It's amazing,'' he said. Most of the 13,500 or so journalists wo n't even get in the hall, or will only part of the time. They're being accommodated in the vast <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, dubbed the `` Media Village.'' There's plenty of room _ but it's across the street from where the action is. Outside, scores of satellite uplink trucks were being put in place, their dish antennas pointed skyward. There's a mobile-home village of network equipment _ and the handful of trailers the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigns each will use as command posts. Back inside, <PERSON> Lagler </PERSON> was looking over his labors when one of his hard-hatted workers came up with a question: When was the meeting to discuss tearing it all down after Thursday night? `` That'll be another problem,'' <PERSON> Lagler </PERSON> said, `` getting all this out of here.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called Friday for student exchange visits with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to help ease tension and establish relations, but the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> refused to accept the proposal. Education Minister <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-shik </PERSON> proposed an exchange visit and `` pilgrimage'' in which about 1,000 students from each nation would march across the other's territory to promote peace. `` It would help restore a sense of national trust and identity among the young generation and provide a foothold for multilateral nation exchanges,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said in a nationally broadcast speech. South Korean officials, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government refused Thursday night to agree to receive a letter on Friday outlining the student exchanges. The <PERSON> North </PERSON> said the plan was pointless, they said. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on July 7 unveiled a plan to end the confrontation between the pro-Western South and the communist North by broad political, trade, cultural and humanitarian exchanges. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said the plan could lead to eventual peaceful reunification. But <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> rejected the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> proposal as pointless. `` This is nothing new and not worth examination,'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said in a July 11 statement. The two Koreas have no relations and the border is sealed. The two nations technically are still at war since no peace treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953. Both governments say they want reunfication, but on their terms. Each side insists it is the only legitimate Korean government and most observers doubt there will be any dramatic change in relations. The education minister proposed the two sides hold talks by the end of July on a plan to allow about 1,000 students from each nation to march sometime this year. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> had said in June that he would call for student exchange visits with the North. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said no need exists for government involvement and student exchanges and meetings should be independent. Its position is designed to support radicals in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, even though any <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> student delegation would be under strict <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> control. South Korean students would march from the border across <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paektu </LOCATION> on the Chinese border. North Korean students would march across the south to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halla </LOCATION> on the southern island of <LOCATION> Cheju </LOCATION>. The march could clear the way for sports events between colleges in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> involving about 200 students, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said. The first sports event would be in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in October, followed by a second sports meet in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> next April, he said. If the first exchanges are a success, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said they could be expanded to cultural and artistic exchanges and tours by students from both nations. The <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government issued the call for improved relations after South Korean radical students demanded immediate reunification. The government used riot police to stop thousands of students marching to the border June 10 for talks with North Korean student delegates. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s administration was caught offguard on the issue as people debated reunification. It has since attempted to catch up on the issue. But <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s proposals were similar or identical to past iniatives by both governments since 1971 on improving relations. All failed to produce results. The two Koreas arranged small-scale family reunification visits and cultural exchanges in 1985. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which has staged a number of attacks on the South over the years, is demanding to act as co-host at the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> this September. Olympic authorities rejected the demand and the <PERSON> North </PERSON> said it will boycott the games. The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet forces that ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. The North invaded the South in 1950 and set off the three-year Korean War. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations fought for the South under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> flag, opposed later in the conflict by Chinese forces.

<HEAD>Parents Wrongly Assume Bathtubs Safe For Unattended Toddlers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many parents incorrectly assume it's safe to leave babies older than 9 months alone in the bathtub, says a study that found old people and children face a similar risk of drowning in tubs and swimming pools. Doctors should remind parents `` that the bathtub is still a potentially lethal place and that the child should not be left alone even for brief periods,'' the researchers wrote in today's issue of the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` We're recommending parents just let the phone or doorbell ring, or wrap the child in a towel and take them with them,'' said study co-author Dr. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Alkon </PERSON>, a pediatrician at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Researchers also found that 89 percent of all <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> drowning victims age 2 to 3 died in private swimming pools. They said that figure underscores the hazard of pools without self-latching fences and pools where house walls with doors serve as one side of the fence. More surprising is that `` we may not have appreciated it is n't just toddlers and infants for whom swimming pools and bathtubs are a hazard,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON>, an epidemiologist at the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> `` These represent potential drowning sites for the elderly.'' <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON> conducted the study with <PERSON> Alkon </PERSON>, the county's medical director for public health programs, and <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, a county epidemiologist. They analyzed coroner's records of 1,587 drowning deaths in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> from 1976 through 1984. The study found that 44.5 percent of the drownings occurred in private pools and 15.6 percent in bathtubs. But among children who drowned before age 2, 55 percent died in private pools and 25 percent in bathtubs. Among people who drowned after their 70th birthday, 50 percent died in private pools and 36 percent in bathtubs. `` It was a surprise,'' said <PERSON> Alkon </PERSON>. `` It does suggest that maybe the elderly should think about having somebody around when they're swimming'' and perhaps when bathing A review of death certificates from the two years covered by the study found that, of bathtub drowning victims younger than 2, none were younger than 9 months. `` Parents begin to think it's safe at about 9 months, and it clearly is n't,'' <PERSON> Alkon </PERSON> said. About 5,300 people drown annually in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and there are up to three times as many near-drownings, <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON> said by phone from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. One-third of near-drownings result in moderate to severe brain damage, Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> wrote in an accompanying editorial, which said pool deaths have made drowning `` an accident of affluence.'' <PERSON> Alkon </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION><LOCATION> ' </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s drowning rate is lower than the national average, probably because the county has relatively few lakes and rivers. County and national rates have dropped in recent years for unknown reasons, they said. <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON> blamed <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s inadequate enforcement of pool-fencing laws, its warm climate and numerous pools for the fact that 44.5 percent of its drownings occurred in pools, 4 -LCB- times the national average. <PERSON> Alkon </PERSON> said enforcement has been much more vigorous since 1984. The study shows drowning prevention programs must focus on the pattern of drowning in each local area, <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON> said. For example, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s high proportion of pool drownings contrasts with studies showing 70 percent of drownings in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> occur in lakes, rivers and other freshwater bodies, he said. In addition to the 15.6 percent of county drownings in bathtubs, 17 percent occurred in the ocean, 11 percent in freshwater lakes or streams, 3.8 percent in public pools, 2.1 percent in reservoirs, 2 percent in hot tubs and 4 percent in other sites, including basins and toilets.

 A Cabinet minister was hit by a rock Thursday when his car was stoned as he drove through the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, where the army imposed or mantained curfews on several towns and refugee camps. The military administration in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> meanwhile ordered closed all eight Palestinian schools in <LOCATION> Qalqiliya </LOCATION> and 15 schools in nearby <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> until the end of the school year following student riots, the army said. The army reopened 800 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools on Monday for the first time in a week. The schools were closed because the army views them as a focal point of the 7-month-old Palestinian uprising in which 222 Palestinians and four Israelis have died. <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, a minister without portfolio, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that when his car was stoned near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, `` One stone went inside and hit me. But we are strong people, and therefore we threw out the stone and continued to drive.'' He said it was the third time his car came under Palestinian attack in the occupied lands. `` I think that the government could have done more original and aggressive things, and in time, so we would not witness these riots for such a long time,'' the right-wing minister added. The army clamped a curfew on <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Yabrud </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> after a student protest broke out in the village, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. It said <LOCATION> Anabta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahur </LOCATION> villages; the western part of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, and <PERSON> Askar </PERSON> and Aida refugee camps were also under curfew. The army also imposed a curfew on <LOCATION> Qalqiliya </LOCATION>, where a 12-year-old boy from the Jewish settlement <PERSON> Ginot </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> was struck in the head by a rock Wednesday night. The boy was uncsoncious for hours but was reported in good condition Thursday. Dozens of enraged Jewish settlers tried to enter <LOCATION> Qalqiliya </LOCATION> after the attack but were turned away by soldiers, the army said. The army was investigating reports that windows of three Arab-owned cars there were smashed. Leaders of the Palestinian uprising have called on residents of the occupied territories, which were taken by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Six-Day War, to give Palestinian schools nationalistic names. In the biblical <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nativity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> became <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> is now called <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. In east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police arrested a 16-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> caught throwing an empty bottle at an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> bus, one of about six such incidents in the city Thursday morning. No one was hurt, a police spokesman said. In central <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a small bomb apparently planted by Palestinian militants exploded just outside <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, but caused no casualties or damage, police said. In <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, a district court sentenced an Israeli Arab, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Araba </LOCATION> village, to 15 months in prison and 18 months suspended sentence after finding him guilty of erecting a roadblock and raising outlawed flags of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Police in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said Moslem guerrillas fired nine rockets into an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military outpost near <LOCATION> Marjeyoun </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before dawn on Thursday. They said the attack was in the eastern sector of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone, but that no casualty report was available. The police said that hours later, about 40 Israeli troops in seven armored personnel carriers advanced into <PERSON> Jabal </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Dahr </PERSON>, a mountainous area north of the security zone, and strafed the area with machine-gun fire. They said three guerrillas were killed Wednesday when Israeli soldiers and allied Lebanese militiamen of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> clashed with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters in <LOCATION> Libbaya </LOCATION>, two miles from <PERSON> Jabal </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Dahr </PERSON>. The police said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjaiji </PERSON>, commander of the pro-Iranian, <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> organization in <LOCATION> southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was among those killed. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said it lost one soldier in the search-and-destroy mission Wednesday.

 The persistent Veterans' Peace Convoy went through one <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> customs station Thursday after crossing the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> with 14 trucks and a school bus in defiance of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` They're on their way south,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group that opposes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. Convoy members were later delayed for a time at a secondary customs area after Mexican authorities discovered firecrackers in one of the vehicles, an official said. The firecrackers, which were left over from the Fourth of July, were disposed of and were n't the main cause of the delay, said <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, a convoy spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Convoy organizers spent much of the day arranging for escorts to accompany the trucks to the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> border, which are required of any imports being taken through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in unsealed trucks, she said. Non-convoy trucks passing through the customs station also were required to arrange for escorts, she added. The convoy paid about $ 650 for two guards Thursday evening and headed for <LOCATION> Saltillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, about 3 -LCB- hours away. On at least three separate occasions, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has blocked the group's trucks from leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, contending that taking the vehicles to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would violate a 3-year-old trade embargo. The government maintains the food and medical supplies qualify as humanitarian aid exempt from the Nicaraguan Trade Control Regulations, but that the vehicles are not humanitarian aid. Convoy members disagree. Eight `` convoyistas'' were arrested Saturday in a tense confrontation with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials, <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents and <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> police after <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> refused to let the convoy cross the border. One of the eight was rearrested early Monday and charged with blocking traffic at the same bridge when Customs again refused to let him cross. Later Monday, however, the group said it started crossing vehicles and finally drove the last one across Wednesday. The group said the first 11 passed without question, while the last four were told to provide personal and vehicle identification. `` A very funny thing that happened was that different officials, police and border and treasury officials ran into us in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> and different places and advised us to go one at a time late at night,'' said convoy spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. `` And so we tried it and it worked.'' `` They ` mace' us, they arrest us, they break our windows, they impound our vehicles _ and then all of a sudden they let us pass,'' said convoy coordinator <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said he drove `` Pathfinder,'' the lead convoy vehicle, directly past <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials and paid his 75-cent bridge toll at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday. The truck was involved with all three incidents at which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs has blocked the group's exit. Customs spokeswoman <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Torre </PERSON> said Thursday that the convoy had crossed into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> without the knowledge or approval of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, and that the group still faces possible prosecution if it does not return the vehicles within 30 days. Violating the Nicaraguan Trade Control Regulations could mean fines of up to $ 50,000 and up to 10 years in prison. Some of the vehicles bear signs and brightly painted slogans, including a multicolored school bus emblazoned with, `` Veterans Peace Convoy to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' and `` Bikes, Not Bombs.'' Ms. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Torre </PERSON> said the government's policy toward the convoy had not changed. Last month, a convoy attempt to cross with 38 vehicles and 106 people was blocked by customs officials who stood in the roadway and temporarily detained four of the group's trucks. The activists then drove to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, tried unsuccessfully to meet with federal officials and returned to <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> last Friday. The convoy is sending some 300 tons of supplies by ship. About 10 tons of supplies were loaded on the vehicles when the group arrived in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> last week for its second attempt at crossing the border.

Asked by the judge to give a date for his trip, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> first said he could not remember but later said it could have been in 1985. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has said he spent two years as a fighter with the Amal militia in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, but has repeatedly denied being a member of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a radical, Iran-backed Shiite Moslem group in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The group is believed to be an umbrella organization for kidnappers holding foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. One of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s brothers, <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON>, is <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s security chief The <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner was hijacked in June 1985 on a flight from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, was shot and killed after the hijackers forced the plane to land in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage during the 17-day ordeal. A court document introduced Thursday also indicated that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was being sought on a murder charge in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1983. The document, read by Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON>, gave no details. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said he was not aware of the charges. The document was obtained after West German federal investigators asked authorities in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for assistance in their investigation of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s defense attorneys questioned the value of the document as evidence, saying it was an unsigned telex with few details. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> also said that he smuggled explosives into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because he was afraid of `` committing a sin'' against <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>. `` I did not say no because I'm a Moslem and its my duty to obey those who are wiser,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said, referring to a man he said ordered him to smuggle liquid explosives into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The Koran says obey Allah, obey the prophet and obey those who give you orders. I was afraid of committing a sin if I did not accept.'' He refused to identify the man who ordered him to smuggle the explosives. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admitted bringing explosives into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on two occasions. He was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport in January 1987 when liquid explosives were found in his luggage, but he said he had succeeded in smuggling another shipment a few weeks earlier. In other testimony, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said he fought in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces and took part in street battles in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> against `` government soldiers'' and Christian Phalangist militiamen in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> between 1984 and 1987. He said he had been wounded in the arm by a bullet in streeting fighting in 1985, but could not remember if his arm was still in a cast in June, when the hijacking took place. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has testified that he was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia from 1980 to 1982. He said he also took part in fighting during that period. He arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> late in 1982 and applied for political asylum, but returned to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in November 1984 after his request was turned down. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last year rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s extradition A <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court sentenced one of his brothers, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, to 13 years in prison in April for the January 1987 kidnappings of two West Germans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an attempt to gain <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s freedom.

 A nursing-home worker indicted on charges he raped nine elementary-school girls now claims he has assaulted as many as 60 children in the last nine years, a spokeswoman for the county prosecutor said Thursday. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 22, is `` one of the greater threats to female children in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> who has ever lived,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolan </PERSON> in ordering <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> held without bond. `` We told the judge that in the course of his confession, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said that he could have assaulted or raped 50 or 60 girls since the age of 13,'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> of the state's attorney's office said Thursday. `` If any person should be held without bail, it's him,'' <PERSON> Bolan </PERSON> said at a hearing Wednesday for <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> admitted raping eight of the girls aged 6 to 9 who were cited in the indictment and possibly the ninth, said <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>. `` He ca n't remember all his victims,'' she said. There was no comment Thursday from <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Towles </PERSON>. The telephone at his office went unanswered. The prosecutor's office announced <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s indictment Wednesday on nine counts of criminal sexual assault, as well as on counts of aggravated unawful restraint and armed violence. According to the indictment, the nine victims were assaulted on the South Side between January and June 24. They were forced into abandoned buildings and raped after being threatened with death if they did not cooperate, prosecutors said. A knife and brass knuckles were brandished in one of the attacks, Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said police recovered brass knuckles from <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s home. He was arrested July 6 after a 9-year-old raped in April identified him on the street while she rode in a car with her mother. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told police he worked as an orderly for Avenue Care Center, a South Side nursing home. A woman who answered the phone there Thursday said an orderly by that name had not been to work in several days. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s arraignment was scheduled for Aug. 4.

<HEAD>Pasta Resistance: Italy Loses Its Noodle Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The land of pure pasta and taut tortellini is afraid that Italians wo n't be using the old noodle anymore. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the mecca of macaroni since the days of <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON>, is bracing for what purists say will be an invasion of rubbery ravioli, squishy spaghetti and, heaven forbid, limp linguine. `` In the coming weeks, Italians will have to say goodbye to their beloved firm pasta,'' said the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> lost its bid to maintain its so-called `` pasta purity'' law, a 1967 rule requiring all pasta sold in the country to contain durum wheat, which is firmer and more expensive than other varieties of wheat. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> could not use the law to block pasta imports from the other 11 Common Market nations, even though <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> still can compel its own pasta makers to use durum wheat. `` That flavorful and firm macaroni, the product of our able pasta makers, will be challenged, and maybe even replaced, by the gluey and insipid pasta from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> moaned. Italians have been eating pasta for at least 700 years and claim it was brought to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON>. It is always cooked `` al dente,'' or firm. `` We have a profound respect for pasta,'' said <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Menconi </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pasta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Makers </ORGANIZATION>. `` Go to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and eat their pasta,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` It practically melts on the plate. Our pasta is alive on the plate.'' Italian pasta makers insist the issue was not one of trade barriers. `` This is a question of protecting the consumer,'' said <PERSON> Albino </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganaspini </PERSON>, the spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Barilla </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest pasta producer with an output of 450,000 tons a year. Italian firms produce about 1.8 million tons of pasta a year, and the average Italian gulps down about 55 pounds of noodles annually. <PERSON> Ganaspini </PERSON> said imported pasta could cost up to 30 percent less than the kind made with durum wheat, but predicted few Italian customers would lower their standards. The pasta case was brought to the Common Market's court by West German pasta producer <PERSON> Drei </PERSON> <PERSON> Glocken </PERSON> after an Italian court sought to block the company's export of pasta made with a wheat blend. The court's decision was based partly on a similar case in March 1987, when it ruled that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s beer purity law violated <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> free trade rules. The German rule had banned beers that did not contain the four `` pure'' ingredients: hops, yeast, malt and water. Despite the presence of the cheaper foreign beers, West Germans have remained loyal to their pure domestic brews. Will Italians stick to their pure pasta or go for the new wave of noodle? `` Sure I'd buy it, because it's cheaper,'' said <PERSON> Orsolina </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrini </PERSON>, a Roman seamstress. But <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecarelli </PERSON>, owner of a pasta shop in central <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> founded by his grandmother, said Italians will not mind paying more for the purer pasta. `` When we eat pasta it is with a certain amount of religiosity,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mystery Woman Getting Facelift After 1,700 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ZIPPORI, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Like <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, the mystery woman has dark hair, soft brown eyes with a come-hither look and full red lips with a faintly amused expression. But after 1,700 years, she is getting a facelift. `` The greatness of this woman is that she speaks to you from beyond time,'' said <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Netzer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, co-director of a project to move and preserve the woman's portrait in a 4th century mosaic on the floor of a Roman villa. On Thursday, archaeologists began the arduous task of lifting the 430-square-foot mosaic, rolling it up strip by strip and moving it 125 miles south to the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The woman's beauty and ambiguous expression have prompted a comparison a famous <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> painting, the <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, which hangs in the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` It's the eyes. They follow you. There is nothing like her in contemporary Roman art,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, an archaeologist from <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, who is directing the project with his wife, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>. The scholars still do n't know whether the woman was a real person or an artist's concept of ideal beauty. They say she could be a famous actress from the nearby theater, a woman the artist loved or a depiction of Aphrodite, the ancient goddess of love. `` Maybe she was supposed to be Aphrodite, but maybe she was a real live person as well,'' said <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>. One clue to the woman's identity may be in the building itself, which <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> speculates might have been an inn housing visiting actors for the 3,000-seat theater next door. Brackets on the floor indicate three couches were placed around the mosaic and that the room was used for dining, maybe even as an after-theater restaurant. The border of the mosaic contains theater masks and the theme of the panels is connected to the god <PERSON> Dionysis </PERSON>, who was associated with the theater. So the mystery woman might have been an actress, an <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of her day. `` The betting is 2-to-1 that she was a real person,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, 20, one of about 100 American students and volunteers helping on the dig. The portrait and other panels of the mosaic are done in tiny, naturally colored stones that <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said were laid down over a watercolor blueprint painted by the artist. The state of preservation as well as the subtle artistry are remarkable. For example, there was still a blush of color on the cheeks when the portrait was daubed with a wet sponge. The task of giving the mosaic a facelift has fallen to Dodo Shenhav, an <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> expert who compares raising the 18-by-24-foot mosaic to surgery. <PERSON> Shenhav </PERSON>, whose past challenges have included removing the Dead Sea Scrolls from sealed ceramic jars, said the operation will involve fixing a water soluble glue to the mosaic and covering it with burlap and additional glue. Once the seal is fixed, workers chisel under the stone carpet and roll it up in a half-dozen strips. The pace is expected to be slow, and <PERSON> Shenhav </PERSON> said it could take two to three weeks. <LOCATION> Sepphoris </LOCATION>, site of the modern-day cooperative farm of <LOCATION> Zippori </LOCATION>, was the capital of the <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> province of Roman Palestine. It was a cosmopolitan city, one of the few places where Jews, pagans and Christians lived in harmony. The mosaic is contemporary with Rabbi <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanassi </PERSON>, who codified the Jewish law of the <ORGANIZATION> Mishna </ORGANIZATION> in the city about A.D. 220. The city, only four miles from <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>, is also sacred to Christians as the birthplace of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The city, which had a population of 20,000 in Roman times, was devastated by an earthquake in 363. The tremors brought down the villa in which the mosaic was located and the rubble helped preserve the mosaic.

 Eight years after <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in defeat and despair, his long political exile is coming to an end here in his native <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. No longer is he shunned by the Democratic establishment or scorned as the hapless leader who turned over the keys of the White House to Republican <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. With the Democratic convention threatened by discord, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to mediate his high-profile differences with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He has earned respect of all of us,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> explained. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he wants <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to play `` a real role'' in settling the differences. `` He understands the equation,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> will deliver an opening-night speech before the Democratic convention on Monday. He is hosting receptions for the media, former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members and other dignitaries. And, the Carter Presidential Center will be the site for many convention-related activities, such as forums on domestic and foreign policy issues. At long last, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> is an undisputed elder statesman of the party. Democratic chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said Americans have changed their opinion about <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> after `` eight years of three-by-five cards and hands-off government'' under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` People understand the sincerity and the seriousness of purpose and the enlightment of values and views that President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> brought to his administration,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. `` And I think he will be greeted and welcomed at the Democratic convention as he should be _ just as a president whose roots were planted and nurtured here in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> but who made a great contribution to values around the globe,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. Those must be sweet words to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, particularly since they come from a man who wanted to see Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., not <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee for president in 1980 It has n't been easy for <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> turned him out of office in 1980, humiliating him with a 44-state sweep. Even after losing the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> remained a favorite target of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Republicans, blamed for the sagging economy and ridiculed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for talking about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` malaise.'' For a long while, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was remembered as the president who left American hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the leader who authorized a rescue attempt that ended in failure in the desert. He presided over a nation that waited in long lines for gasoline and had to pay double-digit interest rates for loans. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has had his setbacks, too: 242 servicemen killed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, record budget deficits, the Iran-Contra scandal and, most recently, the picture of an American warship shooting down a civilian airliner over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, killing 290 people. Perhaps these events have softened the Republican-promoted image of <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as inept. On the campaign trail, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, certain to be the Republican presidential nominee, is likely to pass over <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and talk about `` <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> Democrats.'' A relationship with <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has proven not to be a political liability, as evidenced by the election successes of former administration members such as <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s secretary of transportation, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who won a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador who now is mayor of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Though <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s name is not frequently invoked by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, all of the Democrats who ran for president _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> included _ made a pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to pay respects this year. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s success is in marked contrast to that of another former president, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Fourteen years after <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> resigned in disgrace, he still avoids the Republican presidential conventions and plays only a backstage role in offering occasional advice to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Sandinista Crackdown Spurs Dissidents, Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leftist Sandinista government's violent crackdown on its critics has backfired and given new momentum to opponents, dissidents say `` These actions are going to strengthen the attitude of the common people who do n't want this regime,'' said <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> labor minister and the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is the start of the opposition moving from words to actions.'' Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said that any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to resume arms shipments to the Contra rebels would revive a war in which a truce was declared months ago. `` We hope they -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- do not commit this madness, since it would be newly legitimizing'' the civil war, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Thursday on state-run Voice of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> radio. During the crackdown this week, the government broke up a demonstration, closed independent news outlets and expelled the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador. The fallout continued Thursday, when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 385-18 to condemn <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government for `` brutal suppression of basic human rights.'' A similar resolution was passed Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. That measure included the possibility of military aid to the Contras if present Sandinista policy does not become more democratic. `` It's tremendously interventionist and illegal,'' Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution. `` We call this imperialism.'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> defended the crackdown as a response to growing threats from the Contras and from attempts to destabilize the government. `` We ca n't take this with our arms folded,'' he said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` What country in the world would n't take measures?'' On Sunday, government troops used tear gas and truncheons to crush a demonstration by 100,000 people in <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The government said 31 demontrators were sentenced to six-month jail terms on Thursday for violating public security laws. Five others received the same sentences on Wednesday. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> expelled <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven diplomats, charging them with crimes against the Nicaraguan people and saying they authored a destabilization plan that included the Sunday march. At the same time, the government closed the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station and suspended for 15 days the only opposition newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>. `` The free press was used as part of the destabilization plan,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> repeatedly attacked the government. The newspaper had backed the Sandinistas when they came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war that deposed the dictatorship of <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. The Sandinistas and the Contras negotiated a truce in March and agreed to discuss a permanent end to their 7-year-old civil war. But a series of high-level talks collapsed without agreement on June 9. In recent weeks there has been a sharp increase in the number of Contra attacks reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. At least eight civilians and several dozen soldiers have been killed in ambushes. A source in <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> said Thursday that Contra leaders planned to meet there this weekend to reorganize the rebel organization and select new leadership. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. The rebel group has been plagued by internal disputes between moderates and hardliners and a lack of cash since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid was cut off earlier this year. Opposition political groups inside the country, however, said the government crackdown has fueled the anti-Sandinista movement. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> reacted harshly because `` they can not stand the tremendous opposition that is gaining momentum.'' The often fragmented political opposition showed more unity on Sunday than ever before in striking out against the battered economy.

<HEAD>Many Cancer Screening Practices Not Used Enough, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans have failed to use several effective cancer screening techniques often enough, possibly because of a lack of publicity and the reluctance of some doctors to recommend them, researchers say. However, two well-known tests, Pap Smears and breast exams, are widely used, the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday in its preliminary findings in a 1987 National Health Interview Survey on cancer control. The survey asked people about the six major tests recommended for early detection of cancer in their age and sex groups. Results point to work that needs to be done in spreading the word about some recommended tests, the Atlanta-based agency said. `` Efforts to increase the -LRB- routine -RRB- use of these screening tests must include educating the public,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` This practice permits the early detection of disease when treatment is most effective _ that is, before symptoms occur.'' For instance, while 97 percent of those surveyed had heard of Pap Smears, only 68 percent of survey respondents had heard of proctoscopy, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> report said, citing results from 5,723 interviews over the survey's first three months. The six tests are annual Pap Smears for women 18 and up _ and earlier if sexually active _ to check for cervical cancer; regular breast exams and mammograms for women 40 and over for breast cancer; and the three checks for colon or rectum cancer: periodic digital rectal exams for people 40 and over, yearly blood-stool exams for those 50 and over, and proctoscopic exams every three to five years for those 50 and over. Only 3 percent of the women 18 and over had never heard of Pap Smears and 8 percent of the women 40 and over had never heard of breast exams. But findings were much lower for the other tests. Seventeen percent of those who should have such tests had never heard of mammography, 20 percent had never heard of digital rectal exams, 17 percent had never heard of blood-stool exams and 32 percent had never heard of proctoscopic exams. Furthermore, for every test except Pap Smears and breast exams, between 19 percent and 45 percent of those surveyed who had heard of the test had never had one. In contrast, 94 percent of women who had heard of Pap smears have had one, and 92 percent of women who know about breast examination have had it. `` With the exception of the Pap Smear and physical breast examination, cancer screening procedures are underutilized in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> concluded. `` It might simply be a lack of publicity,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a fellow in cancer prevention and control at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburbs. `` Some research indicates that some physicians are n't recommending them.'' That, she said, could be due in part to early concerns about the radiation involved in mammograms. Newer-model machines emit much less radiation, `` so now that fear can be pretty much put away,'' she said. Also, she noted that Pap Smears and physical breast exam techniques have been in use longer than some of the other tests. The survey results also found discrepancies between blacks and whites in knowledge of the tests. For instance, while 15 percent of white women over 40 had never heard of mammography, 30 percent of black women over 40 never had. While 29 percent of white respondents over 40 had never heard of proctoscopy, the figure for blacks was 55 percent. Researchers `` definitely'' believe the racial differences are tied to education levels and socioeconomic status, Ms. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. The findings were for January-March 1987. At the end of this year, researchers hope to release the results from the complete 12-month survey.

<HEAD>Government Bans Mandela Birthday Concert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government banned a birthday concert for <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> because it is terrified of any event that honors the jailed black leader, anti-apartheid activists said. Activists had hoped to the pop music show would be the highlight of celebrations marking <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s 70th birthday. But <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON>, an activist who coordinated arrangements for the `` Concert for Peace,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> told organizers Thursday that the show would be scrapped. The day-long concert was to feature some of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s top black musicians and take place near the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. It was scheduled for Sunday, the day before <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s birthday. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is probably the most popular leader among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s disenfranchised black majority <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON> said the government declined to give reasons for the ban. `` The only possible conclusion is that the South African government is terrified of the concept of the Mandela celebration,'' <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON> said. The organizers had anticipated a crowd of 25,000 people at the concert and planned to donate the proceeds to charities. They had arranged to hire a private security firm to ensure that no disturbances occurred. Police last week arrested several people organizing a separate Mandela birthday celebration in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Activists fear that event will also be banned, but the government has made no announcement. Activists said at a news conference after the arrests that they were determined to find a way to honor <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. `` In spite of all the intimidation, in spite of the obvious fear of the government, our decision is clear: we will celebrate,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> of Reformed Churches. `` If we can not come together in our streets and halls,'' he said, `` we will celebrate in our homes and churches, but we will make sure <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s birthday does not go by unnoticed.'' Police refused comment on a South African <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> report that officers raided offices of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> anti-apartheid organizations Wednesday, confiscating posters advertising <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s birthday `` The police were looking for documents and posters they could submit to a magistrate as part of their argument for having the Mandela birthday celebrations banned,'' the church council said. `` We fail to conceptualize how the celebration of Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s birthday with song and dance can constitute a threat. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has been jailed since 1962 and received a life sentence in 1964 after being convicted of plotting a sabotage campaign to overthrow white-minority rule. When arrested, he was leader of the guerrilla wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Surveys indicate <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> probably would be elected president if blacks could vote in national elections. His release from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> has been sought in a prolonged international campaign. But the government has said it will not free him until he publicly renounces violence. He has rejected the condition unless the government lifts its ban on the guerrilla group and dismantles apartheid. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 A woman who gave birth in an airliner restroom, then left her newborn daughter stuffed beneath a sink is `` very remorseful'' and wants the child back, the woman's lawyer said <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Locasto </PERSON>, 24, surrendered to authorities early Thursday and pleaded innocent to felony child endangerment charges. She left the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail arm-in-arm with her husband after posting bail of $ 50,000. Locasto, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> resident and the mother of two toddlers, faces up to six years in prison if convicted. The blue-eyed, brown-haired baby was in good condition at <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, which has received hundreds of calls from people offering to adopt the 8-pound, 9-ounce infant, spokeswoman <PERSON> Traci </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials took temporary custody of the child, dubbed <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> by a hospital nurse, after the infant was found swathed in bloody towels, crying beneath a sink on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 on Wednesday. The jetliner had just completed Flight 35 from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The child was believed to have been under the sink for six hours. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Locasto </PERSON>, 26, was unaware his wife was pregnant or had given birth aboard the plane, investigators said. Flight attendants told investigators that as the jetliner crew was preparing for takeoff from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, a female passenger asked to use the bathroom. The flight was delayed for a half-hour as flight attendants knocked on the restroom door, urging the woman to come out so the trip could begin. The woman finally emerged and joined her husband and their two children, investigators said. Flight attendants found the bathroom splattered with blood, but sealed it off in the belief the woman had an extreme case of diarrhea. It remained locked until after the plane landed. About 20 minutes after the plane landed Wednesday morning at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, a cleaning crew found the infant crying amid a pile of blood-soaked towels under the sink. The Locastos left the airplane with other passengers. After the flight, blood was found on one of the Locastos' airplane seats Using a passenger list, sheriff's detectives contacted the Locastos' relatives on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, and they in turn called relatives the couple were visiting in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Altos </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Locasto </PERSON> surrendered Thursday after her husband called sheriff's detectives None of the relatives were aware the woman was pregnant, said sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON>. `` I am confident she did not plan to have the child on the plane,'' her attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, said after she appeared in court in an orange jail jumpsuit. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> described his client as `` very remorseful, very distraught,'' adding she told him she wants to keep the baby. He refused to discuss the case further or reveal details of <LOCATION> Locasto </LOCATION>'s background Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagstaffe </PERSON> said he did not know why she left the child on the airplane, and would not say whether <PERSON> Locasto </PERSON> has a criminal record or a history of mental or other problems. A court hearing Monday will determine whether county officials should be given permanment custody of the infant. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> was placed in the custody of the Children's Protective Services section of the county <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> after being found. Little else was known about the Locastos, who were described by their <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> neighbors as a reclusive family. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> reported that the couple married in April 1986, and moved to a quiet <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> neighborhood two years ago. The woman's husband reportedly operates a limousine business. `` They're regarded as loners,'' an unidentified neighbor told the newspaper `` Particularly, her.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the only obstetrician-gynecologist in two poor counties with high infant mortality rates, just `` worked himself to death,'' one of his nurses said after he died while performing surgery. His son, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a third-year medical student, watched helplessly as <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> suffered a massive heart attack Wednesday at <LOCATION> Bullock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` He never turned patients down _ no matter what their financial status,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, recalling times when his father received $ 5 a month from a patient trying to pay off a medical bill. The elder <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 54, had been delivering 60 to 80 babies a month in <LOCATION> Bullock </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> counties, which have some of the nation's highest infant mortality rates, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think there were times when, for a period of several weeks, he was on call constantly,'' said hospital administrator <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Brookhart </PERSON>, adding that he was amazed at <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' heavy workload. `` I asked him how he was able to keep such a schedule. He would shrug and say, ` You get used to it.''' Because of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' death, obstetrics patients will have to be referred to <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> hospitals 40 miles away, <PERSON> Brookhart </PERSON> said. Finding a replacement to serve the two counties will be difficult. `` It's a very medically needy and also a medically risky and underinsured population,'' he said, adding that most obstetricians prefer to share their practices and workloads with a partner. `` We're a small, rural community. I do n't think we can support two obstetricians. And I do n't think we're going to find another obstetrician who is willing to work this whole area by himself.'' Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> obstetrician who studied under <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, said he influenced many young black doctors. `` He took care of essentially anyone who came to see him,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't remember too many times when he left the area for a vacation or whatever. He was pretty much on call 24 hours a day.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had nearly completed a hysterectomy when he died. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>'s Hospital in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> used its emergency helicopter to fly Dr. <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jehle </PERSON> to Union Springs to complete the surgery, which was done without complications, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said Thursday. `` The patient was given a spinal -LRB- anesthesia -RRB- and she was awake during the entire thing,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jehle </PERSON> said. `` When I got there ... she seemed pretty calm, but she watched the whole thing.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had delivered several babies Tuesday, `` and I could tell from his on-call room he had been at the hospital all night,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jehle </PERSON> said. `` When I left, one of the nurses shook her head and said, ` He worked himself to death.''' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had planned to leave on a cruise this weekend to celebrate his 32nd anniversary, Ms. <PERSON> Jehle </PERSON> said. His son stood by in the operating room as medical personnel tried to save his father's life. `` That was one of the worst feelings I have ever had in my life,'' the younger <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I felt helpless. `` He was a good person at heart, and he was the best teacher and mentor I had in my life,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. He said he hopes to return to <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> or <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> counties as a doctor after he completes his medical training. `` There's no one to take his place down here,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sugar Making Comeback Relative To Other Sweeteners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sugar is making a comeback among American consumers after years of trailing other sweeteners and might be about ready to hold its own, says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that in 1987 Americans used more sugar, instead of less, for the first time in 12 years. Per capita consumption rose 3 pecent to an average of 62.2 pounds for the year. The deliveries of refined sugar to the food and beverage industries, and wholesale and retail markets, rose 5 percent from 1986 to more than 7.6 million tons. Despite the increase, sugar still made up only about 40 percent of the 152.4 pounds average 1987 per capita consumption of all sweeteners, including those with calories and those without. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said in the July issue of Farmline magazine that growth in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population and higher incomes have contributed to greater sugar use. But there are other reasons, and one of the most important involves <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION>, or high fructose corn syrup. `` After more than a decade of seizing markets from sugar in such diverse products as beverages, baked goods, jams and other processed foods, the cheaper to produce <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> has come close to reaching its technical limit of substitutability,'' he said. `` This has stanched the dramatic losses of sugar in the past 12 years.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> added: `` Of course, there is the possibility of a technical breakthrough -LRB- such as -RRB- lower-cost forms of dry fructose or low-calorie sweeteners.'' The sugar industry had been threatened by rival sweeteners for many years but suffered no major losses until about 1975 when <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> emerged. Sugar prices were high at the time, and <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> was cheaper to produce, an advantage it still holds. At the time, in 1975, the beverage industry was sugar's largest single market, using 25 percent of the sugar available. By last year beverages used only 3 percent, turning to <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> and non-caloric sweeteners for diet drinks. Sugar deliveries to the beverage industry dropped to 212,000 tons in 1987 from 2 million in 1975. But in other industrial uses, sugar and <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> are not always interchangeable, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. For example, sugar deliveries to bakery and cereal manufacturers rose to 1.5 million tons last year from 1.2 million in 1975. Candy makers increased sugar use last year by 9.1 percent from 1986. One reason is that <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION>, a liquid, is less adaptable in candy manufacture. A big question for the future of <ORGANIZATION> HFCS </ORGANIZATION> involves federal sugar policy. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said that much will depend on whether sugar will continue to be supported by the government at current price levels, which encourage the development of substitute sweeteners. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar policy also involves imports and measures used to protect domestic producers from cheaper foreign sugar flooding the market. Although there was some strengthening, in May the world price of sugar was still only 9 cents per pound, or only half of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support price. Bills are in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> which would lower the support levels, thereby reducing domestic output and boosting imports. That is the approach favored by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` Another initiative by the administration seeks to liberalize trade through multilateral trade negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' he said. `` The goal is to eliminate trade-distorting subsidies and allow better market access for sugar worldwide.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said a freer world market could reduce sugar prices for American consumers but would probably also reduce the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar industry.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> is finding that being adopted by a childless baron is a costly honor. The Ferrysburg businessman was one of 10,000 people who responded to a search by a German baron looking for an heir. The search was first publicized June 3 on the nationally syndicated television show, `` A Current Affair.'' <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON>, 57, met <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Theordor </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebieg </PERSON> last week at the baron's 100-bedroom castle on the Mosel and <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> rivers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and was chosen heir. He will inherit the castle when the 76-year-old baron dies. But there's a catch. One of the stipulations was that <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> help the baron pay off a $ 600,000 mortgage on the castle. `` I already have been adopted, but now I have to go out and slay the dragon,'' <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> said. He said his adoptive father said he sold the castle several years ago to a developer who began turning it into a hotel and restaurant but ran into financial trouble. Now a bank wants to repossess the castle, <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> said the baron also wants his heir to help him raise $ 1 million to turn the hotel into an international hotel. `` He just does not have the vim and vigor to go out and do these things, so he said, ` This is something my new heir can do, my new son,''' <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> said. `` One of the reasons he chose me is because I have an entrepreneurial background.'' <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> owns two small businesses in the <LOCATION> Ferrysburg </LOCATION> area, including a sales company that represents acrylics manufacturers. He also owns a company that developed an electronic warning device for the elderly, he said. While the television show reported the 1,428-year-old castle was on 89,000 acres, blueprints show only 100 acres, <PERSON> Hemmelsbach </PERSON> said.

 Opposition candidates began a nationwide round of rallies to press their charges that the governing party stole the presidential election. The victor, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, said the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must respond to calls for change after its biggest losses ever in the July 6 balloting. An estimated 15,000 supporters of conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> withstood a downpour Thursday in the western city of <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> to hear him accuse the government of manipulating the election. He said his appearance in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s second largest city was the first in a national tour to gather signatures in a referendum to decide whether the party should seek to have the election annulled. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, who won in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> but finished third nationwide in results announced Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said he does not know who won. But he said neither <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, candidate of the left, can claim a credible victory. The commission, dominated by the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won with 50.36 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> followed with 31.12 percent and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> with 17.07 percent. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, candidate of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, planned to begin a national tour next week after a major rally in the huge Zocalo Plaza on Saturday. He said he would target regions where he considers `` fraud was the most brutal and ran roughshod on our party members.'' The son of one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s most popular presidents, <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> led a dissident movement in the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> before breaking away to become candidate of several small parties. Commission figures showed he won in the Federal District, the adjacent states of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morelos </LOCATION>, the central western state of <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the northern half of the peninsula. The loss was the biggest ever since the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1929, but it still retained control of both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Parties supporting <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> won four of the 64 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats in an unprecedented loss for the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. Both the left and the right made inroads in the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The absence of any official presidential returns for a week after the balloting fed reports of fraud and rumors of feuding between old-guard <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> leaders who wanted their traditional overwhelming victories and supporters of <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who said he wanted a clean election. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, receiving congratulatory visits from party-affiliated organizations Thursday, said he had been given `` a clear mandate for change'' and called for unity among all parties and factions. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> today has the capacity and flexibility to face successfully the call for change,'' he told state governors and the party's executive committee. `` May no one try to convert political plurality into national division.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, academic coordinator at the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Colegio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, said that since Mexican independence, elections have been used to transfer power within a group or party rather than to decide which would govern or who the leaders would be. `` It is because of this tremendous weight of anti-democratic history that what is happening today is important and it is for that same reason that the change in electoral custom _ from non-competitive elections to true elections _ finds so many obstacles,'' he wrote in the newspaper Excelsior this week. Change, he said, is only beginning. `` It's obvious that the birth of modern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is turning out to be a difficult and prolonged delivery and that it's still not known if it will reach a happy ending,'' he said. Some of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s losing candidates said the party must reform to survive. `` With the triumphs obtained by the opposition a profound restructuring ... of the party to recover the ground lost in the past elections becomes indispensable,'' <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrales </PERSON> told the newspaper <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Toluca </LOCATION>, 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the state of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. He lost a congressional election in the <LOCATION> Toluca-Metepec </LOCATION> district to a candidate from <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>' coalition. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Millan </PERSON>, an economic consultant who lost a congressional race to National Action in the capital, said the party `` now has to demand from officials greater efficiency and dedication, a pure honesty and an attitude of service that the population is demanding.''

 President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> says he has a mandate to modernize the nation's political and economic systems because he is the youngest elected chief executive in more than 50 years. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, 40 was declared the winner in the July 6 election as the candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, which has governed <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1929. He takes office in December. The youngest chief executive this century was <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s most revered presidents, who was 39 when he took office in 1934. Today, half of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s population is 16 or younger. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, was one of two opposition candidates who gave <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> a tough race that resulted in the slimmest victory margin for the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> in its history. Also running was <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Critics of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> contended the party won the election through fraud. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> insists that he does not mind the lower margin of victory, that it represents a first step in modernization as a recognition of opposition forces and recent changes in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In claiming victory the day after the polls closed, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said the end of the era of virtually exclusive power for the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> must be recognized. `` It is the new political reality of the nation, and with which we will have to coexist in a harmonious and respectful fashion,'' he said. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> spoke during the campaign of the need for `` democratic reforms,'' clean elections and less state intervention in the economy. He will have to prove to Mexicans weary of six years of economic hardship that growth can start again, jobs can be generated and the steady erosion of purchasing power halted. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' main problem after his inauguration will be to foster faith in his government so it can support any reforms he plans to undertake. An increasingly greater number of Mexicans have become disenchanted with and skeptical of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and the country's political institutions, as indicated by the high number of abstenteeism at election time _ about half the registered voters, according to government figures Like his three precedessors, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has had no experience in elective office.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has given conflicting indications on whether he will veto a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill that deeply cuts his request for Star Wars spending and restricts his arms control policies, lawmakers say. `` I do n't think we have a clear signal,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said `` I'm not certain the president will sign this bill.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spoke on Thursday shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 64-30 for the measure, hours after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved it, 229-183. Both Democratic-controlled chambers split along party lines as they sent the bill to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told their colleagues that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> had indicated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was likely to sign the bill But Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., who made an unsuccessful attempt to strip the provisions <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> disliked, said the administration opposed the measure The bill permits $ 4 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 5-year-old Star Wars anti-missile program is formally known. That is slightly above the current SDI budget of $ 3.9 billion but far less than the $ 4.8 billion <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted. As part of the Star Wars budget, the bill deeply reduced spending for the space-based interceptor, which is being developed as the first phase of an eventual SDI program. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> wanted $ 330 million for the program, but the bill restricts the total to only $ 85 million. The final measure was worked out by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> and is a compromise between bills passed separately by each chamber. Shortly before the final vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected, 58-35, an effort by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and other conservative Republicans to return the bill to a conference committee and strip out the Star Wars reductions and other arms control restrictions opposed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The bill authorizes <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending of $ 299.5 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The total is a slight reduction from the $ 301 billion authorized this year and marks the fourth straight year of either freezes or reductions in the defense budget, following large increases during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term. Highlights of the bill: ARMS CONTROL _ The measure requires withdrawal and retirement of three aging missile-firing Poseidon submarines as new missile-firing boats are introduced into the fleet. That continues the policy of generally keeping the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> near weapons limits imposed by the unratified SALT II nuclear treaty. The bill also directs the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to prepare for a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests, a longtime goal of arms control supporters. The measure bans flight testing of `` depressed trajectory missiles'' as long as the Soviets refrain from testing their versions of those weapons. Depressed trajectory weapons, which fly relatively low, could be launched from submarines and could theoretically be launched off each nation's shores with relatively little warning time. MILITARY-DRUGS _ The bill includes $ 300 million to increase the military's role in the anti-drug effort and orders the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to provide more intelligence and tracking information to civilian law enforcement agencies. PAY RAISES _ The nation's 2.1 million uniformed military personnel will receive a 4.1 percent pay increase. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought a 4.3 percent increase. NUCLEAR WEAPONS _ The measure proposes $ 250 million each for the single-warhead Midgetman and the railroad version of the MX, a pair of land-based nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted only $ 200 million for the Midgetman, which is strongly backed by Democrats, and $ 793 million for the MX. The bill also contains $ 250 million that the secretary of defense in the new administration next year can spend for either program. <ORGANIZATION> NAVY </ORGANIZATION> SHIPS _ The bill includes money for one more Trident missile-firing submarine, a pair of Los Angeles-class attack subs, the first of a new Seawolf class of attack subs, three destroyers, two oilers and an amphibious assault ship. OTHER WEAPONS _ The measure provides money for 180 F-16 jet fighters, 36 F-15 fighters, a dozen F-14 jets for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, 84 FA-18 jets for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> carriers, 24 AV-8 Harrier jets, four of the new long-range C-17 cargo planes, 669 M-1 tanks, 581 Bradley Fighting Vehicles for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, 1,310 Standard missiles and 72 Apache attack helicopters for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, 72 Blackhawk helicopters for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, 1,310 Standard missiles, 261 of the top-line MK-48 torpedoes, 815 Patriot air defense missiles, and 48,000 rockets for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s multiple-launch rocket system

 The hearing-impaired boy whose origins mystified authorities for months until he was recently reunited with his family has been placed in a children's home in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilera </PERSON>, 9, was moved to the home in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> agency. He can receive special education for deaf children there, an agency spokeswoman said Wednesday. The boy, known as <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON>, was found last November near downtown <PERSON> Ciudad </PERSON> <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON>, across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. Because he could barely hear or speak and could n't write, authorities could not determine his identity. Finally, the freckle-faced boy's mother was located in <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>, a port on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Gulf Coast. The boy, nicknamed <PERSON> Chuy </PERSON>, is staying at a home about 200 miles from <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>. Social workers tried unsuccessfully to persuade <PERSON> Chuy </PERSON>'s mother to giveup her son for adoption, DIF spokeswoman <PERSON> Juana </PERSON> <PERSON> Barazas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> said. `` She said she could n't take care of him,'' Ms. <PERSON> Barazas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> said. `` She did n't want to give him up for adoption because she was afraid she would n't be able to see him. His grandmother feared he would run away again.'' The mother reluctantly accepted the agency's decision to move him to the school, DIF officials said. The boy was called <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> because he was found on a Saturday _ sabado in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION>. His drawings of what looked like a plane crash prompted speculation he had survived a crash that killed his parents and sister. Authorities now believe the pictures might have been an attempt to tell them <PERSON> Chuy </PERSON> lived near an airport in <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>. His mother, who had been searching for her son for about nine months and suspected <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> was her missing child, answered an advertisement placed by an <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter in a Mexican newspaper. The two were reunited June 28 in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>. `` His mother will be able to see him every couple of weeks.

 Neighbors said they feel certain that rival crack dealers firebombed a duplex apartment in which four innocent people died and six other people were injured. `` There's been threats to blow up the house. You sit on the porch and you hear it every day: ` I'm going to get my stuff and I'll be back and I'll blow you up,''' neighbor <PERSON> Dorethea </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 20, told The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> and her mother and another family were left homeless Thursday morning when the fire spread to their adjacent duplex on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a narrow, tree-lined street on the city's north side. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> and other residents said crack cocaine was sold and used for years at the firebombed apartment. Fire Department Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> identified the dead as <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 66; <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Conerly </PERSON>, 32; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 47; and <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 39. The four victims were alcoholics and had nothing to do with the illegal drugs, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` They just drank,'' she said. `` They'd fuss about their wine and where to get money for wine.'' The victims were n't related, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. Six people in the two-story building were injured and were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Receiving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Archambault </PERSON>. A nursing supervisor who declined to give her name said this morning that none of them was still there. Police and fire officials have disclosed few details of the fire. `` All the witnesses that were interviewed have indicated there was a firebombing,'' said a police arson inspector who would n't give his name No arrests have been made, police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said today. `` They did their business right outside,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` From what I'd heard, they'd been arguing earlier -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- about money, and they said they'd be back later to settle it.'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Dorethea </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, said authorities arrested several alleged crack dealers and boarded up the duplex about four months ago. `` We were really happy,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` Then, a month and a half later, -LRB- crack dealing -RRB- started again.'' <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cureton </PERSON>, who lived with his girlfriend and two daughters in the same duplex as the <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> family, said he was awakened before dawn Thursday by the sound of breaking glass. He said he went outside, saw the fire and also saw five men fleeing on foot. Crack was dealt from the duplex next door `` on and off for the past four years,'' <PERSON> Cureton </PERSON> said. `` Different crews would come in and deal.'' He agreed with <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> that an argument among dealers on Wednesday prompted threats of violence. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cureton </PERSON> stood in front of their burned duplex and watched arson investigators throw ashes and charred wood with shovels out of a window of the unit where the four alcoholics' bodies were found Temporarily homeless, they expressed sharply different feelings about relocating. Asked whether she might find a new home in a part of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> untouched by crack, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said: `` I doubt it. Crack is all over. So I do n't know.''

<HEAD>FAA Expert: Better Inspections Key To Avoiding Repeat Of Aloha
Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Proper aircraft inspection is the `` weak link'' in efforts to prevent accidents like the one that ripped the top off an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner at 24,000 feet, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> expert says. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> panel, which winds up four days of testimony here today, is trying to determine the cause of the April 28 accident and what it can teach about the problems of operating aging airplanes. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> national resource specialist on aircraft structures from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, also told the hearing Thursday that he believes the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 broke open because a bonded fuselage joint separated, leading to a rapid failure of the metal along a line of rivets. `` It was the worst-case condition,'' <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> said. Another <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> witness told the inquiry board that tiny cracks were found in nearly half the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 jetliners known to have been inspected under an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> airworthiness directive issued after the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident. An 18-foot section blew away from the top of the pressurized <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> jet over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, throwing a flight attendant to her death and injuring 61 of the 94 people aboard. Passengers in the forward cabin were exposed to the air while the pilot made an emergency landing. Asked by inquiry chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> what `` the bottom line'' was for preventing another such accident, <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> replied it rested with the airlines and their inspection programs for corrosion and metal fatigue. `` I know where the weak link is, and it's in the inspection,'' <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> said. Such inspections are mind-numbing jobs, he said, adding that research was needed to take the `` human element'' out of the inspections. `` Hell, we put a man on the moon, why ca n't we develop an inspection program that can guarantee we can find these cracks?'' he asked. The Aloha jet, built in 1969, had had 89,680 landings, second-highest of any 737. Swift, one of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials who examined the jet, said he believes adhesive gave way along a lap joint where parts of the fuselage are bonded and riveted together, most likely because of corrosion. Within a week of the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered all 737s with 30,000 or more landings to undergo a special visual inspection of fuselage lap joints, and 737s with more than 50,000 landings to have additional inspections using high-frequency electronic equipment. Airlines were required to fix any problems found and report test results to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, manager of the airframe branch in the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> aircraft certification office, told the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> panel 291 planes were affected by the order As of this week, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has received reports on 100 planes, of which 49 had cracks. Five or more cracks were found in 14 of those planes, he said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashworth </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> aircraft certification division, said he was concerned about the cracks but saw no imminent danger to the planes or to air passengers. `` We of course are requiring that all cracks we find be repaired. That's only prudent maintenance,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bishop Says Drug Traffickers Donate To Parish Priests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drug traffickers in many Latin American countries are donating money and offering drugs to parish priests, and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is not sure what to do about it, a Venezuelan bishop said. Monsignor <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Porras </PERSON>, assistant bishop of <LOCATION> Merida </LOCATION>, 350 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, said in a recent telephone interview that in recent years more priests are being offered the gifts for personal gain or for use in charities. But he said the church is n't sure the money should be turned down because some of the traffickers consider the donations retribution for their sins, <PERSON> Porras </PERSON> said. The growing problem was one of the key issues discussed by Venezuelan bishops during their annual <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, which ended Tuesday. `` Priests are being offered money and drugs, primarily at the parish level. This has been going on for several years now in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Some see it is a way to launder money they do n't know what else to do with, but it is possible that the donation could be licit if it is for use in charities, to forgive sins.'' A Spanish-born priest from a poor parish near <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> was arrested last April carrying 46 pounds of cocaine as he waited in <LOCATION> Maiquetia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> for a flight to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. It was the first case in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> of a church official being arrested for involvement in the drug trade. The priest, who confessed he had made at least two previous trips to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in which he carried and later sold drugs, said he used the proceeds from the sales to pay for a new chapel, improvements in the parish school and charity. `` There is no doubt that money is one of the biggest temptations of this society -LRB- and -RRB- these are all charities that require money. This is a human failing from which -LRB- priests -RRB- are not exempt,'' <PERSON> Porras </PERSON> said. `` To accept it for the church is not correct. Any church works done using money derived from drugs can not be consecrated,'' he said. `` But I think it could be acceptable for charities.'' The bishop said knowledge of the offers is transmitted to higher church levels through confession, and that Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> has been informed of the matter through regular church channels. The pope has not issued any specific instructions, the bishop said. `` To know whether the intention -LRB- of the donor -RRB- is good or bad is difficult,'' he said. Meanwhile, the church cannnot cooperate fully with law enforcement agencies because of the confidentiality of confession, he said. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s Justice Minister <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> <PERSON> Agudo </PERSON> met with the church officials during the five day episcopal conference, but no formal agreement was reached between the church and the government, he said. `` There is no type of institutional help because of the position of the church on confidentiality,'' he said. Instead, he said, `` the church is doing what it can to insist upon moral values and to help out needy families. This is the labor we must do.''

<TEXT>
 Twenty-eight peace activists headed through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on their way to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> still wondering why <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials suddenly stopped enforcing a trade embargo and let them drive across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. `` It's had a lot of us shaking our heads,'' said <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a coordinator of the Veteran's Peace Convoy. The group cleared <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> customs stations Thursday night with 14 vehicles after the group paid about $ 650 for two escorts to accompany them to the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> border. `` It feels great,'' <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said after the convoy was cleared by Mexican officials to leave <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>. `` We've been ready to go for a long time. We feel it's a big victory, even though we have far fewer people and vehicles than when we came down last month.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> blocked the group's trucks from leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at least three times, contending that taking the vehicles to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would violate a 3-year-old trade embargo. The government agrees the food and medical supplies qualify as humanitarian aid exempt from the Nicaraguan Trade Control Regulations, but says the vehicles are not humanitarian aid. Convoy members refused to sign forms promising to return the trucks. Eight `` convoyistas'' were arrested Saturday in a confrontation with officials at the border and one of the eight was rearrested early Monday when Customs again refused to let him cross. But later Monday, the group said it started crossing vehicles and finally drove the last one across Wednesday. `` Maybe they had a policy of going ahead and letting us slip across as long as we were quiet about it,'' <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said. `` There were times when people looked the other way and in fact in some cases there was nobody looking.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Torre </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> said the policy toward the convoy had not changed. `` We do not routinely stop vehicles heading south,'' Ms. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Torre </PERSON> said. `` But if someone announces that they'll be violating the law, we'll know about it and will be waiting for them,'' she said. She said three of the convoy drivers were allowed to cross because they told Customs they were going to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The convoy cleared one Mexican customs station Thursday, but at a second, some firecrackers were confiscated by Mexican authorities, who insisted the vehicles have escorts. Escorts are required for people transporting imports through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, customs officials said. The convoy left a psychedelic-painted bus, named `` Peace Train,'' in <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, for a charity organization, because they did not think it would make the trip. The convoy first tried to cross the border at <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> in June with 38 vehicles and 106 people, but were refused permission. They returned to <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> last week with fewer people and vehicles, because some members of the group had to return to work. Thirteen vehicles will stay in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, they said, and one will return.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> analyst convicted of spying for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has ended a four-day hunger strike at a federal prison at the urging of his father. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, 33, began eating Thursday, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION>'s maximum security penitentiary said. `` We are very relieved,'' said <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>'s father <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a biology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION>. The elder <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> has kept in daily contact with his son since the hunger strike began Sunday, and said he convinced <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> to end it. `` He proved his point and we did n't want this to continue too long,'' Dr. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> was transferred to <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> last month from a federal medical facility for convicts at <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, his father said. Since then, the elder <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> said, his son's letters have been diverted to <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for security checks, but have never been forwarded to addressees. The prisoner began a hunger strike because he believed his letters were n't being delivered, and because he thought attorneys were being barred from visiting him, his father said. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> also complained that his ailing wife <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, also convicted and imprisoned, was not receiving proper medical care. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, executive assistant to the warden at <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> was not visited by an attorney because the court has not appointed one yet. Naval officials were not available Thursday night to comment on the allegations concerning his letters. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> began refusing food Friday morning but ate later in the day, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. He ate breakfast and lunch Saturday, but refused to eat dinner, and skipped all meals from Sunday until Thursday, when he ate breakfast and lunch, the prison said. `` He's fine,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` He was n't on it -LRB- the hunger strike -RRB- long enough to hurt himself.'' `` I would imagine he thought he got his point across,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> was sentenced last year to life in prison without parole. He was charged with passing classified information to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents in 1985.

<HEAD>South Korea Calls For Student Exchange Visit With North</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> today urged communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to let students from both sides march across the divided peninsula in a pilgrimage to ease tension, but the north refused to accept the proposal. The south's education minister, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-shik </PERSON>, proposed that about 1,000 students from each side should march north or south across the 600-mile peninsula to build mutual trust and help open the way for normal relations. `` It would help restore a sense of national trust and identity among the young generation and provide a foothold for multilateral nation exchanges,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said in a nationally broadcast speech. But <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> notified the south Thursday night that it would not accept a letter outlining the proposal. A North Korean statement monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said the plan would only be considered if <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> apologized for refusing to accept its last three official messages. Radical student groups in the south, who have been pressing for reunification, criticized the government proposal as a sham. Student leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was a bid to divert attention from unpopular government policies. On June 10, the government used riot police to stop thousands of students marching to the border for talks with North Korean student delegates. On July 10, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> unveiled a plan to end the confrontation between the pro-Western south and the communist north by broad political, trade, cultural and humanitarian exchanges. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said the plan could lead to eventual peaceful reunification. But <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> rejected the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> proposal as pointless. `` This is nothing new and not worth examination,'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said in a July 11 statement. The two Koreas have no relations and the border is sealed. They technically are still at war since no peace treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953. Both governments say they want reunfication, but on their terms. Each side insists it is the only legitimate Korean government and most observers doubt there will be any dramatic change in relations. The education minister proposed the two sides hold talks by the end of July on a plan to allow about 1,000 students from each nation to march sometime this year. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> had said in June that he would call for student exchange visits with the north. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said there is no need for government involvement and student exchanges and meetings should be independent. Its position is designed to support radicals in the south, even though any <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> student delegation would be under strict communist party control. South Korean students would march from the border across <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paektu </LOCATION> on the Chinese border, while <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> students would march across the south to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halla </LOCATION> on the southern island of <LOCATION> Cheju </LOCATION>. The march could clear the way for sports events between colleges in the north and south involving about 200 students, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said. The first sports event would be in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in October, followed by a second sports meet in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> next April, he said. If the first exchanges are a success, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said they could be expanded to cultural and artistic exchanges and tours by students from both nations. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s proposals were similar or identical to past iniatives by both governments since 1971 on improving relations all failed to produce results. The two Koreas arranged small-scale family reunification visits and cultural exchanges in 1985. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which has staged a number of attacks on the south over the years, is demanding to co-host the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> this September. Olympic authorities have rejected the demand and the north has said it will boycott the Olympics. The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet forces that ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. The north invaded the south in 1950 to trigger the three-year Korean War.

<HEAD>Nation's First Liver-Pancreas Transplant Performed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first person to undergo a liver-pancreas transplant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is making steady progress and appears to have been cured of his insulin-dependent diabetes, his doctors say. `` He can go to the ice cream parlor now and nothing will happen to him,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzakis </PERSON>, one of about 10 surgeons who took part in the landmark operation. The 39-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> man, whose identity was withheld at his request, received the organs during 16 hours of surgery July 1 at <LOCATION> Presbyterian-University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. In addition to being diabetic since 1969, the man had hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver, which he got from blood transfusions during a 1964 heart operation. The diabetes, unrelated to the hepatitis, struck him when he was 20. The man eventually would have died from his condition. `` Both he and his wife ... are a very strong couple. Psychologically, he's doing very good,'' <PERSON> Tzakis </PERSON> said at a news conference Thursday. The man could have been saved with a new liver alone, but doctors worried the single organ might have failed without a new pancreas to overcome the diabetes. The pancreas, a pear-shaped organ behind the stomach, produces insulin, a hormone needed to convert sugar, starches and other food into energy. Severe diabetes prevents the body from producing or properly using insulin, making daily injections necessary. Complications include kidney and heart disease, blindness, nerve damage and gangrene leading to amputation. <PERSON> Tzakis </PERSON>' patient had experienced only mild nerve damage and eye problems, which studies show can sometimes be reversed. `` Our patient was an ideal candidate for this operation because he unfortunately suffered from both diabetes and hepatitis, had the proper motivation to undergo a complicated procedure and understood the risk,'' <PERSON> Tzakis </PERSON> said. The operation had been performed only twice before, both times in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Tzakis </PERSON>. The patient was in serious condition Thursday, considered normal, with the main threats being organ rejection or infection, <PERSON> Tzakis </PERSON> said. He could be discharged in a month or so and remain near the hospital for another few weeks before returning home. Two other diabetics currently are awaiting liver-pancreas transplants in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Tzakis </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Experts: Public Interest In Climate May Dry Up After Drought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Public interest in the Earth's troubled climate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed to end the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drought, weather experts warned during a drought symposium here. `` Society tends to flit from hysteria to hysteria,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s state climatologist and moderator of the symposium. He said the 1988 drought, although not as dry as a 1986 drought in many places, has drawn much attention because some of the affected areas include large media centers. `` I'm worried ... that when the next drought happens, we are going to have to rediscover the climate problem,'' said <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climatologists </ORGANIZATION>. Experts said Thursday that the greenhouse effect _ the warming of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere _ has brought needed attention to changes in the global climate, even though it is not directly related to the drought. Many of the 13 climatologists and meterologists at the symposium agreed that the Earth's temperature is warming, but they debated whether it is a short - or long-term phenomenon and its impact on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> However, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the uncertainty means policymakers should begin to deal with the possible effects, especially undertaking policies that `` make sense in their own right.'' <LOCATION> Mankind </LOCATION> must reduce reliance on fossil fuels, he said, by becoming more energy efficient, replanting forests and investigating alternative energy supplies. Scientists have warned in recent years that <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere is gaining in carbon dioxide and other gases, which trap heat and cause the overall temperature to rise. Besides fossil fuels, the depletion of forests in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has been blamed for the increase of carbon dioxide and methane. Some have warned that higher temperature will change the character of many countries, for example drying out the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> or melting polar ice caps. The symposium was sponsored by The Weather Channel, an Atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast the meeting live. Earlier Thursday, the climatologists were told the movement of planets and the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and sunspots may help lead to drought in the Southeast. `` There is some evidence that as Jupiter goes around the sun at its fastest point, there are drought conditions in the Southeast in the months of April and October,'' <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> state climatologist <PERSON> Gayther </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodenhuis </PERSON>, director of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he was skeptical of <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON>'s thesis `` There's an enormous number of possibilities that one could chase,'' <PERSON> Rodenhuis </PERSON> said. `` The next business of the scientist is to ... extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect.''

 A man charged with killing seven people and wounding three others at a defense plant said on a tape played in court that he quit his shooting spree after `` it was n't fun anymore.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> also told police that if the woman who spurned him had gone out with him `` just once'' he would have left her alone. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s obsession with his former co-worker apparently culminated in the killings, police said. `` I hope she'll never do this to anybody else again. She ca n't play with people's lives,'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, 39, said of <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> in a telephone conversation with a police hostage negotiator taped during the 5-hour siege at <ORGANIZATION> ESL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 16 The tape was played at <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s preliminary hearing Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He indicated to police Lt. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON> on the tape that he was still angry with <PERSON> Black </PERSON> for spurning his advances. He said <PERSON> Black </PERSON> got him fired from the company by disclosing a series of letters he'd written to her. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON> that he knew only one of the 10 people he gunned down. He said on the tape that the rest just `` popped up'' in the hallways of the company, and he shot them. The former ESL software engineer is charged with seven counts of murder, three counts of attempted murder, felony vandalism and second-degree burglary. Police say he walked into the building loaded down with weapons and ammunition and fired at least 100 rounds. ESL is primarily involved in developing computer programs for <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> classified projects. Speaking in a distinctive <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> twang, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> told <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON> on the tape that, `` I came down here to do as much damage to equipment at ESL as possible.'' Once he had `` run around and got through being upset it was n't any fun anymore,'' he said on the tape Shortly before he surrendered to authorities, he asked <PERSON> Grijalva </PERSON> on the telephone if <PERSON> Black </PERSON> was still alive. `` She ca n't regret it if she does n't live,'' he said in the tape. He said he believed <PERSON> Black </PERSON> took an `` immediate dislike'' to him. `` She tried to avoid me like the plague,'' he said. However, he said on the tape that he has had Black listed on his life insurance policy as his beneficiary.

<HEAD>Prosecutors To Investigate 1,500 Suspected Nazi War Criminals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> justice officials are about to open murder investigations against about 1,500 suspected Nazi war criminals, most of whom served in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, authorities said. <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dressen </PERSON>, an official with the West German Central Office for the Investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday he would turn over the names to <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> prosecutors soon. <PERSON> Dressen </PERSON> said the estimated 1,500 names were obtained by his office from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> archives. Most of the crimes concern transportation of Jews from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps, and most of the suspects are former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> secret police or security officials who worked in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dressen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hans-Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeseler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> prosecutor whose specialty is probing Nazi war crimes, said he was `` fighting against time'' and he expected the investigations to be extremely difficult. `` Many witnesses have already died, or are not able to testify because of their age, or are scattered around the world,'' <PERSON> Roeseler </PERSON> said. Officials did not say whether all the suspects were known to be still alive, nor did they provide any details on any of the cases. <PERSON> Dressen </PERSON>'s office is responsible for initial investigations into suspected Nazi war criminals and does not have prosecutorial powers. If there is ground for further investigation and possible prosecution, the cases are turned over to prosecuting authorities. Since the end of World War II, the Ludwigsburg-based Central Office for the <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> has carried out nearly 100,000 investigations, with more than 6,000 people convicted and sent to prison.

 A convoy of 67 trucks rolled into town loaded with more than 45,000 bales of hay donated by Southern farmers returning a favor to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> farmers, who are short of livestock feed because of the drought. `` It's the greatest feeling in the world,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Ellerbe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, farmer who received donated <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> hay during a 1986 drought. `` I should be home now.

The caravan was greeted Thursday night by people who stopped their cars to wave from an interstate overpass and by Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>, who thanked <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON> and others for the donated hay and labor. `` We're really very grateful for the generosity and human spirit of these folks who we wanted to help a couple of years ago and who now are helping us in an extraordinary way,'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said. The trucks carried 45,000 to 48,000 bales, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> of the organizing <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speedway </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're paying it back with interest,'' <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> said, referring to the farmers' hay gift in 1986. `` We took 20,000 bales two years ago, and we're bringing back more than twice that, so we're happy.'' The hay will be distributed to farmers in several counties starting today, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading daily said today the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> regards the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as its counterpart and expressed disappointment that a recent <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> did not end a ban on contacts with the mainland. The People's Daily, the official voice of the party, said in a front-page editorial that the two parties have `` unshirkable duties'' to carry forth the great traditions of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. `` What we can contribute to the future of our nation and mankind is unlimited. We hope that the two parties can rid themselves of past differences and unite hand-in-hand to achieve the cause that was left unfinished by our ancestors.'' The Communist and Nationalist parties formed common fronts in the 1920s and 1930s to fight Chinese warlords and the invading Japanese, but fought a civil war following the end of World War II that ended in the flight of <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s Nationalists to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949. The editorial said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` highly appreciated'' the 13th <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for dismissing the idea of an independent <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and calling for efforts to attain the historic task of reunification. `` We believe that the trend of relaxing tensions will develop after the conclusion of the 13th Party Congress. This is what the people of the two sides expect,'' it said. But the daily expressed disappointment that the Nationalists made no change in their policies of regarding the Communists as enemies and maintaining the `` three nos'' policy of no contact, no negotiations and no compromise with the mainland. `` This is really against the times and will of the people,'' it said. The Nationalists, while saying the ban on official contacts will stay, did approve a plan to ease the ban on visits to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> by mainland Chinese residents, allow import of raw materials from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and permit <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> business investment on the mainland if it is conducted through a third country. Last year the <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> government removed restrictions on visits to the mainland by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> residents. Tens of thousands of tourists, businessmen and people visiting family have since traveled to the mainland. The editorial also said the Nationalists are unreasonable in their statements that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the people of the mainland should be separated. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, it said, has become one with the people of the mainland. The daily said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> continues to welcome people from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> for visits and business and expressed confidence that the policy of `` one country, two systems'' can help reunify the nation. Under that system, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is to retain its capitalist system for 50 years after <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> returns the colony to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997.

 A <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> neighborhood where two teen-agers were shot and killed in a 24-hour period is `` at a very explosive point right now,'' a minister who works with local gangs says. An undercover police detective Thursday shot and killed a teen-ager who allegedly pointed a gun at him across the street from the scene of a Wednesday night gang-related shooting death, a police spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Rasheen </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, 18, was pronounced dead at <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, police department spokeswoman. The plainsclothes detective, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, yelled `` police'' and then shot <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> after <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> pointed a pistol at him in the <LOCATION> Fuller </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> area, Ms. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> said. Undercover police officers had gone to the area to quiet a crowd that had gathered to console <PERSON> Gracie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carolina </PERSON>, whose son was killed Wednesday, Ms. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> said. One of the officers spotted four or five men lying in the park, at least one of them with a gun, she said. `` This thing was just inflamed over there,'' said officer D.E. <PERSON> Lindley </PERSON>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Delontay </PERSON> <PERSON> Carolina </PERSON>, 16, was killed in a drive-by shooting incident, Ms. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> said. He was reportedly shot at by three people in a four-wheel-drive vehicle. One juvenile was in custody and warrants were issued for a second juvenile and <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, she said. Authorities said the two shootings were not related. `` It is two unfortunate incidents that occurred in the same area, but it's not a related incident,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>. The Rev. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, who works with youths at the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, had said before the shooting that the animosity gang members feel toward each other might spread to police officers and that the neighborhood is `` at a very explosive point right now.'' He said the shooting Wednesday was inevitable. `` It was going to happen,'' he said. `` It was just a matter of time. There have been at least two other gang shooting incidents in the neighborhood in the past two months.

 A batch of bad chicken salad was believed to have caused an outbreak of food poisoning among 500 people who ate at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>'s dining hall, officials said. Most of the cadets were treated at the Academy hospital and sent back to their rooms, a spokesman in the public affairs office said Thursday. None was in serious or critical condition, officials said. By Thursday afternoon, 330 of the 500 treated were released. About 200 medical personnel, including some from <ORGANIZATION> Peterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION>, were called in to assist after Tuesday's lunch of chicken salad, which contained salmonella bacteria. The salmonella bacteria causes food poisoning, with symptoms including nausea, diarrhea, fever and dehydration. The recovery period is normally 12 to 18 hours with more serious cases taking two to three days.

 A former police officer was in custody today after an eight-hour standoff in which he shot and critically wounded a policeman and injured another man who attempted to evict him from his home, authorities said. The suspect, identified as <PERSON> Tommie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 46, surrendered Thursday waving a white flag, after about 50 canisters of tear gas were fired into his home, police said. He was charged with attempted murder, said Detective <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Segers </PERSON>. Officer <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Domagala </PERSON>, 37, was shot in the forehead some six hours after the suspect barricaded himself in the house, said police and hospital officials. <PERSON> Domagala </PERSON> was listed in critical but stable condition early today, but police said he was expected to survive. `` When the officer was brought into the emergency room, he was conscious and he was talking to paramedics,'' said Commander <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>. Also wounded was <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, a mover who was shot in the arm as he was trying to evict <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> earlier in the day for non-payment of his mortgage, police said. They said the incident began when three movers tried to move <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> and his belongings from the building. When <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> failed to answer the front door, <PERSON> Luna </PERSON> knocked out a door panel with a sledgehammer, authorities said. The door opened, and they saw <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> inside with a shotgun, said Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> fired three shots and hit <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, 27, who was treated at a hospital and released. <PERSON> Domagala </PERSON> was shot as police negotiators were trying to talk <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> into surrendering in the late aftenoon. Police said <PERSON> Domagala </PERSON> was peeking around a corner of the building and was shot from about 100 feet away with a handgun. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had five handguns and a shotgun, authorities said. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> veteran, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> was a patrolman from 1966 to 1971, when he was terminated after he exhausted his medical leave with the department but was still out sick, said Police Superintendent <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. The superintendent refused to discuss <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s medical problems, although he said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> was arrested in 1986 for shooting two dogs. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Selikoff </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> took possession of <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s brownstone house after <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> failed to pay his mortgage, which was insured by the VA. He said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had not made a mortgage payment since August 1984.

<HEAD>Boy Trapped in Freezer Four Hours Is Revived</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 8-year-old boy reaching for Popsicles on a hot day became trapped in a chest freezer for four hours and his body temperature dropped nearly 30 degrees before doctors were able to revive him. `` It's kind of a miracle,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, director of the emergency room at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> was brought Thursday night. `` I have never seen anything like this in my 12 years in medicine,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. Doctors used intravenous fluids and warm blankets to slowly warm <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s body, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. The boy was listed in extremely critical condition early today at <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Babies </ORGANIZATION>' and Children's Hospital in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. The youngster was reported missing by his parents after he disappeared Thursday afternoon, when the temperature soared into the 90s. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> apparently fell in the freezer while trying to retrieve some Popsicles, his father, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogg </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. The lid closed on <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and he was trapped. Because of the freezer's location, any pounding or yelling would not be heard. <PERSON> Krogg </PERSON>, who had last seen his son about noon, found him at 6:30 p.m. when he went to the freezer in the family's garage to get meat for dinner. When <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> was brought to the hospital at 7 p.m., <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> told <PERSON> Krogg </PERSON> the chances of resuscitating the boy were one in a million. His body temperature had dropped to 70 degrees, icicles had formed on his body and he had no pulse. His heart had stopped beating, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. About 11 p.m., <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s heart began beating again and by 1 a.m. his vital signs were good, he had a strong pulse and good blood pressure and his temperature had returned to normal, the physician said. `` Obviously, he is not out of the woods yet,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. It will take several days to determine whether <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> has suffered any brain damage, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Conservatives Win First Election Of Thatcher's Third Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With a mixture of relief and jubilation, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today celebrated a narrow victory in the first special parliamentary election of her third term. Party chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> hailed the <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> win in west <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION> as `` a solid vote of confidence in the government and its policies. Energy Secretary <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said, `` If there was a time for protest, this was it _ and the opposition parties cold not capitalize on it.'' He said the Conservatives had done well, considering this was the first chance for voters to protest Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s controversial third term program, which includes an unpopular new property tax But voters in <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION>, where royal palaces and high-rise tenements crowd into three square miles, drastically cut the Conservatives' winning margin in the election Thursday. Conservative candidate <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishburn </PERSON> was declared the winner with 9,829 votes to 9,014 for second-placed <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> when results were announced early today. The winning margin was 815 votes. At the general election in June 1987, the Conservatives' winning margin over second-placed Labor in the 48,500-voter district was 4,500. The result was bad news for Labor. Bookmakers heavily favored the Conservatives to keep the <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> seat, but many political commentators said <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> had a good chance of victory due to widespread hostility to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s latest policies. Since the 1987 general election, her government has introduced laws to impose an unpopular new property tax, shaken up the welfare system and ordered a review of the cherished <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, on a swing through southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>: `` I was optimistic about the possibility of winning.'' But he said the current contest for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> leadership had helped damage the party's chances. Former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Benn </PERSON>, a hardline leftist, has issued a formal challenge to take over from <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> leader and the party is scheduled to vote on the issue this fall. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> has renewed warnings to left-wing dissidents that Labor must adapt its policies or risk a fourth successive general election defeat. But in response, <PERSON> Benn </PERSON> has accused <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> of seeking to water down <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-nuclear defense policy and its traditional demands for more state ownership. The outcome of the Kensington poll was also bad news for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two centrist parties, which paid the price for an acrimonious merger last spring of their former electoral alliance. Both the merged party, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and a breakaway <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ran candidates, splitting the already minority centrist vote. The Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodhart </PERSON> trailed third with 2,546 votes. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was fourth with 1,190 votes. The election of <PERSON> Fishburn </PERSON>, 42, an <LOCATION> Eton </LOCATION> and Harvard-educated former senior editor on the respected weekly, The Economist, means that the Conservatives' huge 101-seat majority over all the other parties combined in the 650-seat House of Commons remains unchanged. The seat had been held for the Conservatives for 20 years by legislator Sir <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhys </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The election was caused by his death last November. The lackluster campaign in <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION>, which contains thousand of highly transient apartment dwellers, failed to excite local electors and only 51 percent voted. The <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> constituency is one of the most starkly divided in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In its southern part, rows of elegant period houses belong to some of the wealthiest people in the country. <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> home of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' aunt, Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, and his cousin, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, also have apartments in the palace. <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Kensington </PERSON>, a high immigrant district, is characterized by shabby streets of state-subsidized housing.

The bed costs $ 4 for 15 minutes.

 About 1,500 striking workers from a bankrupt food-processing plant converged on the capital today to demand higher wages and more work, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio reported. The employees of the Agrokomerc company were met by hundreds of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> police officers who sealed off an area around the Parliament building, the scene of several previous protests by disaffected workers in this cash-strapped country. No incidents were reported today. The workers walked off their jobs at the plant in <LOCATION> Velika </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kladusa </LOCATION> on Thursday, filed into buses late last night and arrived here this morning to give their complaints to officials, the radio reported. <LOCATION> Velika </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kladusa </LOCATION> is 250 miles west of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. The radio said a government delegation agreed to hold talks with the workers. About 8,000 Agrokomerc workers are receiving guaranteed minimum salaries of about $ 50 monthly, `` which is not enough for survival,'' <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasalic </PERSON>, the head of the company's trade union, was quoted by the radio as telling government officials. `` Our children are hungry and have no clothes to wear,'' he said. He told the government delegation that the workers would not leave <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> until they are given at least $ 70 a month, the radio reported. The employees also are demanding the replacement of some city and company officials. About 5,000 Agrokomerc workers walked off their jobs Thursday and 2,000 marched through <LOCATION> Velika </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kladusa </LOCATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said that many workers then decided to head for <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, `` to present their problems to the federal parliament officials.'' Agrokomerc was declared bankrupt after it issued uncovered promissory notes worth the equivalent of about $ 1 billion. Charged with embezzlement and other charges are <PERSON> Fikret </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdic </PERSON>, the firm's managing director, and several of his associates. They currently are being tried in <LOCATION> Bihac </LOCATION>, a Bosnian town near <LOCATION> Velika </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kladusa </LOCATION>. Workers have staged several marches in the streets after the introduction in May of a government austerity program that allowed substantial price increases and hefty wage cuts. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s austerity measures are designed to curb the country's 175 percent annual inflation and help in repaying a $ 21 billion foreign debt by introducing a more market-oriented economy

<TEXT>
 The murder of a 19-year-old black woman whose body had been scrawled with the letters `` KKK'' may have been racially motivated, the <LOCATION> Ulster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney says. `` A racial motive obviously is a legitimate investigatory lead and we're actively pursuing it,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON> said Thursday. `` We do n't know that -LRB- the killing -RRB- was racially inspired ... If it is racially inspired, that's a horrible development.'' The letters were scrawled on the body of <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON>, apparently with a sharp instrument, <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON> said at a news conference. Miss <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON>'s body was found Tuesday on an abandoned railroad bed. She was last seen Monday evening. There are `` certain parallels'' between the murder and the <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case, but there was no evidence of a connection in the cases, <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, an adviser to Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s family, said Thursday that he and his associates would start their own investigation into whether there was any connection between the cases Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> was found last November with the letters `` KKK'' and racial epithets scrawled in a charcoal-like substance on her skin after being missing for four days.

<TEXT>
 The government said it will approve a new anti-cocaine law that will ban most coca plantations and impose tougher sentences on drug dealers and corrupt officials. The law is the first ban in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> on cultivation of the coca leaf, which is used to produce cocaine. The measure was approved by the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week and by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> said he will sign the law when it reaches his desk. The law limits coca plant cultivation to 29,652 acres and bans production on 76,601 acres. Farmers will receive $ 2,000 for every hectare of coca plants they destroy, with $ 365 of that amount provided by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has long pressured <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to crack down on its cocaine trade. The law also toughens penalties against drug traffickers, coca leaf producers and public officials who take bribes from drug dealers or who interfere with the prosecution of traffickers. `` Over the next five years if the government can get international backing, cocaine trafficking as it is known in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> can be seriously interrupted,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mocolini </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest country, produces an estimated one-third of the cocaine that reaches <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European markets.

 Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> are facing a cash shortage because of curfews imposed by the Israelis and strikes ordered by leaders of the Arab uprising, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official said today. The curfews also have disrupted food supplies to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> reported today. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said there is no food shortage in the region, where 650,000 Palestinians live. An 18-year-old Palestinian, meanwhile, was shot in the left leg today when soldiers clashed with Moslem worshippers leaving a mosque in the Bureij refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, a local reporter said. An army spokesman had no information about the clash. The youths hurled rocks at the troops, who tried to disperse them with tear gas and rubber bullets and finally used live ammunition, wounding the man, who was identified as <PERSON> Ayman </PERSON> <PERSON> Taha </PERSON>, the reporter said. An 11-year-old Palestinian was shot in the leg late Thursday in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Shati refugee camp, hospital officials and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources said. They said the boy was shot when youths hurled rocks at soldiers, who responded with tear gas and live gunfire. But an army spokesman said the Israeli army was not involved in the incident. `` This is not an army matter. This is a local police matter, and that's all I'm going to say,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> police spokesman was not in his office for comment, but a policeman who answered the telephone at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> police headquarters said he knew nothing of the incident. Since the Arab uprising began seven months ago, 222 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a curfew on <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, where 120,000 Arabs live, entered its fourth day today. Curfews also continued in the town of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION> village and <LOCATION> Aidah </LOCATION> refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, and the <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Yabroud </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Anabta </LOCATION> villages. The longest curfew is in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION>, where villagers have been restricted to their homes for eight days after a symbolic protest in which Palestinians returned their Israeli-issued identity papers. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity said similar restrictions were imposed on the Bureij refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, where the army imposed a 15-day curfew last month after the local Arab municipality resigned. Workers were barred from leaving to work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for almost six weeks, resulting in a cash shortage, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said. Curfews have been lifted in all <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> camps, but strikes ordered by underground <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders also have prevented workers from reaching their jobs, the official said. Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> food trucks delivering basic food products were continuing to arrive as scheduled, the official said. `` There is no food shortage in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>; what you've got is shortages of money,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> source said. The <ORGANIZATION> Ha'aretz </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reserve soldier as saying, `` In the past few days I have given out watermelons, cantaloupes and some even come and beg me for bread. We know there is a severe food shortage in the camps.''

 A jury cleared a 19-year-old man of attempted murder and other charges in the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> racial attack because of a faulty identification and other `` loose ends,'' jurors said. A second jury is considering lesser charges against four other defendants accused in the 1986 attack by a white gang on three blacks, one of whom was killed by a car as he fled the mob in the <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> neighborhood. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gucciardo </PERSON> was found innocent Thursday of attempted murder, assault and riot after three days of deliberations. Cheers filled the courtroom when the verdict was announced. <PERSON> Gucciardo </PERSON> smiled broadly and hung his head back in relief. `` I was scared, but I knew that I had n't done anything wrong,'' <PERSON> Gucciardo </PERSON> said. He said he was going to `` celebrate, then go back to school'' at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

Three youths were convicted of manslaughter in an earlier trial. A fourth youth was acquitted at that trial. Jury foreman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaris </PERSON> said, `` We had trouble with identification. It was uncorroborated, and there were a lot of other loose ends.'' <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinnette </PERSON>, one of two black jurors, said the description given by <PERSON> Sandiford </PERSON> of the attacker `` did not match with the person we saw.'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, said Thursday's verdict `` is not justice.'' `` Nobody knows the pain of what we're going through.

<TEXT>
 In a day of fraught, sometimes rambling testimony, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> said illiteracy kept him from knowing about the illegal goings-on at his scandal-plagued company. `` My reading ability will go as far as a comic book is concerned. Do n't try to tell me to read The -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -RRB- Times or any technical thing. That's not my game,'' <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>, 58, testified Thursday at his racketeering trial. Once hailed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a `` hero for the'80s,'' Mariotta is on trial with Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Bronx </LOCATION>, and five others on charges of turning <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions in bribes to obtain government contracts. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> denied those allegations, but it was his wide-ranging stream-of-consciousness responses to his attorney's questions, accompanied by fist-pounding, hand-wringing and finger-waving, that provided the courtroom drama. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>, the son of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> immigrants, has claimed he is virtually illiterate and that other company executives kept him in the dark about their illegal activities. `` My writing ability is nil,'' said <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>, lives in <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION>, a wealthy <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburb. `` For 20 years you could look at my company's records, you will not find one letter or any documentation or anything in my handwriting.'' Asked if he finished high school, <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, spoke of his parents' fights over his father's drinking, nights spent riding the subways with his mother, run-ins with truant officers and his difficulties taking tests. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> complained to the judge that <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> was telling stories irrelevant to his lawyer's questions With jurors out of the room she asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> to make <LOCATION> Mariotta </LOCATION> stick to the questions asked `` and not go off on these tangents designed to evoke sympathy from the jury.'' <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> piped up: `` Your honor, I'm not an intellectual like these people seem to think that I am. I am not. I am emotionally upset because it took me 20 years to build this company and you intellectuals robbed my company from me.'' During the disjointed testimony <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> denied giving <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> stock to <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> in exchange for the congressman's help in obtaining no-bid government contracts. Four former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives have pleaded guilty to state and federal crimes ranging from bribery to fraud and testified for the government in return for leniency. They and other witnesses have said <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> helped create a multimillion-dollar company slush fund for bribes, payoffs and off-the-books luxuries. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> grew from a small machine shop into a $ 100 million defense contractor through a <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> program that awarded government contracts to minority-owned businesses without competitive bidding. Prosecutors charge that <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> concealed from the <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> that he no longer controlled the company. But <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> insisted he was the dupe of greedy men who later forced him out. In 1984 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> for its hiring of rehabilitated drug addicts, ex-convicts and former welfare recipients. In 1986, after <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> was forced out, the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> company shut its doors and filed for bankruptcy.

 A secretary accused of kidnapping a newborn from a hospital had told her boss she was pregnant, took a maternity leave and then brought a baby to work to show it off, her employer says. Employees put up an `` It's A Girl!'' banner, congratulated <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> German </PERSON> and held the baby during the office visit Wednesday. German, 26, of <LOCATION> Wheelersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, was sent to a federal penitentiary in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> for psychiatric tests Thursday following the safe return of three-day-old <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Manns </PERSON>. The woman was charged with kidnapping. It was `` just a case of desperately wanting a baby,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicely </PERSON>. The infant was swiped from a maternity ward crib at <ORGANIZATION> Cabell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday by a woman in a nurse's uniform. The baby was reunited with her parents, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Manns </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Harts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, early Thursday after German returned the child to the hospital in good health. `` It's just an answer to our prayers to the Lord that got her back for us,'' said <PERSON> Manns </PERSON>, 23, a coal truck driver. `` It was just the happiest time of my life to see my baby again,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Manns </PERSON>. German's relatives called a special hospital hotline Wednesday night and German followed with her own call, telling <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents her relatives did not believe the infant was her own, authorities said. `` She wanted to come in with the baby to prove to her mother and her stepfather it was her baby,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>. German arrived at the hospital with the baby Wednesday night and told <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents she had given birth in early July at a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, hospital, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said. A call to the hospital found no record of the birth, and a doctor's exam concluded she had not given birth recently, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said. German was taken into the room from which the infant was abducted and `` began to cry and admitted she remembered taking a baby, but was unable to remember what she did after she took the baby or what hospital she took the baby from,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said in court papers. `` I realize now that this is not my baby,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents quoted German as saying. German worked at WUXA-TV in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, as office manager and secretary to general manager <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. `` She looked pregnant to me,'' he said. `` She came into the office yesterday with the baby and showed it to the staff.'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said German, who joined the station in March, called July 6 to say she was taking maternity leave. German called the infant <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. `` We were shocked and very sad and my heart, our hearts, go out to her,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` She is a nice, softspoken person, and very capable. Obviously, she thought it was her baby.'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said German, who has a 3 -LCB- - year-old daughter, had a history of miscarriages and might have lost her own baby <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate he believed German had faked her pregnancy since December. The federal kidnapping charge carries a maximum life sentence. He said German was believed to have been involved in an attempted abduction of another baby born at the same hospital. In that case, a <LOCATION> Marrowbone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> woman told police that after she gave birth, a stranger visited her at home, brandished a knife and threatened to take the baby before family members stepped in and the woman fled.

<TEXT>
 Clergymen, scholars and survivors of the Holocaust today applauded a message from West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> acknowledging his nation's responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> genocide. `` Germans became guilty of that crime as individuals, but they are collectively liable for the injustice committed in their name,'' said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s message, read to 500 people attending `` Remembering for the Future,'' a conference on the Holocaust and its impact on modern generations. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> joined President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, Israeli President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> in sending messages to the conference on its final day. The West German leader's words were read by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, the Czech-born Jewish publisher who sponsored the weeklong conference. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> lauded <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s willingness to face its past, and at his request, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was given a round of applause. `` No one can rule out the possibility of comparable atrocities happening again,'' said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s message. `` It must not be forgotten. It is an appeal to each one of us to examine our own thoughts over and over again.'' It said: `` We Germans are prepared to live with this terrible truth.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s message said the world `` can never have reminders enough about the tragedy that results when nations abandon their reverence for the sanctity of every human life.'' More than 500 scholars, concentration camp survivors, theologians, artists and teachers met here to examine how Christianity could have allowed the Holocaust to happen. `` The words ` never again' must ever be the pledge of all who pause in remembrance of those who have perished and of all who cherish mankind's deepest hopes and ideals,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his message. The conference, which began in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> a week ago, concludes with leaders of Christian churches joining in prayers for the 6 million Jewish victims of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s genocide during World War II. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON>, a Nobel prize-winning author and survivor of the <LOCATION> Buchenwald </LOCATION> concentration camp where 10,000 people died daily, said that after a lifetime of studying and writing about the Holocaust, he still could not understand how it happened. `` Often I think of the children walking slowly, quietly, obediently, to the flames or to the mass graves, and I am almost grateful for the pain that links my memory to theirs,'' he said in a keynote address. The conference ranked among the biggest of its kind held outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where there has been an expansion in academic studies of the Holocaust. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, 65, lost most of his family at the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in World War II. `` This crime, this disaster, has been examined mainly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Yet it was in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that it happened.'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON>, a French Protestant, was the main organizer of the conference. As a child she lived in a largely Jewish district of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> from which most her friends vanished as the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> rounded up the Jews. She has long believed that Christianity contained a strong streak of anti-Semitism. The Jewish Chronicle, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top Jewish newspaper, has predicted that the conference `` could radically affect the way British people and institutions think'' about the Holocaust. <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, in his message, said he hoped the meeting would `` help to shape a future in which the horror will never be forgotten.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said it was important for generations who did not live through `` those agonized years'' to learn how and why it happened. `` That knowledge will help people everywhere who are determined that nothing like this shall ever happen again,'' she added in her message to the conference. Organizers timed the meeting just before next week's Lambeth conference, an international gathering of Anglican bishops. Mrs. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said the archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>, the Most Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, pledged that the prelates will discuss the outcome of `` Remembering for the Future.'' Leading participants included American academic specialists on Jewish-Chr, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckardt </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckardt </PERSON>; Holocaust historian <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Littell </PERSON>, an American Methodist minister who helped pioneer Holocaust studies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In associated events, organizistian relationsers have arranged a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> exhibition of drawings produced by Jews in concentration camps and a concert at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> featuring works by composers <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Britten </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Nevada High Court OKs Use Of Some Police Decoys To Catch Thieves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which banned use of police decoys who pose as drunks with cash hanging from their pockets, says it's OK if the decoy is alert, well-dressed and more of a `` logical target'' for thieves. The high court Thursday rejected an appeal from <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> DePasquale </PERSON>, convicted in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> of larceny after a police decoy operation in 1983. A plainclothes policewoman was used as a decoy, carrying a shoulder bag in which a fake $ 100 bill was exposed, a zipper pulled tight against the money. <PERSON> DePasquale </PERSON> claimed entrapment. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said it has ruled against use of decoys when they pose as anyone who is helpless, drunk or feigning unconsciousness with money exposed temptingly from pockets. That `` degree of vulnerability'' suggested entrapment, or inducing someone to commit a crime he might not otherwise commit, the court said. In the <PERSON> DePasquale </PERSON> case, however, `` the exposed valuables were presented in a realistic situation, an alert and well-dressed woman walking on the open sidewalks in the casino area,'' the court said. `` The fact that the money was exposed simply presented a generally identified social predator with a logical target,'' the court added. `` These facts suggest that <PERSON> DePasquale </PERSON> was predisposed to commit this crime.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent has been indicted on charges of beating and falsely arresting a lawyer who crossed paths with a presidential candidate's motorcade while walking to his apartment. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatzle </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was charged Thursday with two civil rights violations, each punishable by up to a year in jail and $ 100,000 in fines. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, said he could n't recall any previous case in which an agent was indicted for on-duty actions. The five-year veteran of the agency has been on sick leave because of injuries sustained during the arrest April 10, said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schatzle </PERSON> was accused of kicking and punching <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorayeb </PERSON>, 31, and then falsely arresting him near the motorcade of Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn. The agent was part of the security detail for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who was then campaigning for the Democratic nomination in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Schatzle </PERSON> told passers-by who complained about his actions that the lawyer had spit at him. <PERSON> Gorayeb </PERSON> claimed the agent attacked him when he yelled an obscenity at the motorcade because one of its cars almost struck him as he crossed the street. A witness videotaped the confrontation and presented the evidence to authorities. <PERSON> Gorayeb </PERSON>, who specializes in personal injury cases, said he suffered a broken nose and eye, neck and shoulder injuries.

<TEXT>
 A passenger bus traveling through the war-torn northern provinces ran over a land mine and triggered an explosion that killed 34 people and injured 39, the state-run news agency said. The Ethiopian News Agency said the blast occurred Thursday 55 miles south of the Eritrean capital <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Asmara-Mekelle </LOCATION> highway, one of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s main northern arteries for trade and relief aid. Government soldiers have been fighting two separate rebellions in the northern provinces. The news agency said the bus was destroyed and described the accident scene as `` gruesome and horrifying.''

The government also ordered back to the capital about 60 foreign aid workers who were helping feed drought victims in the north, where Western relief officials estimated 3.2 million people were threatened with famine.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> made no promises to stop ballistic missiles sales to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not stop the flow of high technology to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in response. `` We did n't come to any agreements about it -LRB- missile sales -RRB-, but ... I'm sure that the subject will continue to be an important one on our agenda,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters after meeting with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. When asked about news reports of a Chinese-Syrian missile deal, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Chinese leaders told him their only ballistic missile sales in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> have been to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that an agreement was `` consummated'' under which <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> would sell intermediate-range M-9 missiles to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration officials traveling with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> have said the Chinese are believed to be marketing the weapons, which have a maximum range of about 370 miles, but that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have no indications of a sale. The officials say the M-9, which is potentially capable of striking targets in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, is at least nine months away from production. More than 100 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen sent <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> a cable Thursday warning that future transfer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high technology to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would be `` jeopardized'' if the sale to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> went through. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he got word of the cable only after his meetings with top Chinese leaders, but added, `` I think the way to try to get at it with the Chinese is other kinds of constructive ways.'' Angry over alleged Chinese sales of anti-ship Silkworm missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last fall temporarily froze some high technology sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has also been critical of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s sale this spring of intermediate range CSS-2, or East Wind, missiles to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. In his meeting with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> today, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should bring their relationship to a `` higher plane.'' The 84-year-old senior leader said relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have improved steadily during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term although `` of course there are still some problems between us. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> held closed-door talks with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. It was his second day in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. On Saturday he flies to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the seventh stop on a nine-country trip through <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Discussions here focused largely on missile sales and the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the Chinese-backed Cambodian guerrillas who some fear may muscle their way back into power if <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> pulls its troops out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> massacred hundreds of thousands of Cambodians after it took power in 1975. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ousted them when it invaded in 1978. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have `` a very broad agreement as to certain aspects of that situation,'' including `` rather similar views'' on stopping a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> return to power. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> officially supports a three-party Cambodian opposition coalition that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Thursday that senior <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leaders may retire. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said both countries are pressing for a total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and both view non-Communist Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> as the central figure in a future Cambodian government. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> abruptly resigned this week as head of the anti-Vietnamese coalition. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and several others proposed a peacekeeping force to ensure a cease-fire, the peaceful formation of a government and free elections in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> pledged to remove all its troops, currently estimated at 120,000 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources, by 1990. This has sparked fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> would shoulder aside their two, less powerful non-communist allies in the anti-Vietnamese coalition and seize power once <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s forces have left.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has confirmed it will attend peace talks on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> this month, official Vietnamese radio said today. There had been doubts that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would participate in the talks scheduled for July 25 in <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The talks will be the first among all the warring parties. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> had accused the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> of trying to turn the talks into direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and guerrilla groups fighting its occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <ORGANIZATION> Nguyen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thach </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday his country would attend only if <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> confirmed it did n't change the rules of the informal talks. Voice of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> radio said <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, acting on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION>, asked <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> to convey to Thach assurances that <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> would respect rules agreed upon in a July 29, 1987 communique signed by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The meeting between <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Huy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuong </PERSON>, took place in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> on Tuesday, said the broadcast. The report was monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The broadcast said <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> gave assurances that `` the <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> countries respect the joint Vietnam-Indonesia communique ... and that <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> countries have no intention to turn this meeting into a talk between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the Kampuchean -LRB- Cambodian -RRB- factions.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wants the talks held in two stages, with the Cambodians discussing `` internal problems'' in the first stage and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> joining in a second stage to discuss `` international aspects'' of the conflict.

<HEAD>Drugs Were Delivered To Plutonium Building, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drug deals were made in a restricted plutonium building at the <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION> nuclear weapons laboratory in 1986, the lab director disclosed. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuckolls </PERSON> made the disclosure to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> in a report Thursday on an undercover drug probe dubbed Operation Snowstorm at the facility. The university operates <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> and two other weapons laboratories under a contract with the government. <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON>, near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, conducts highly sensitive research on the `` Star Wars'' missile defense system. As a result of the undercover operation, four contract workers and two lab employees were arrested on drug charges and successfully prosecuted, <PERSON> Nuckolls </PERSON> said. The total drug purchases amounted to less than $ 1,000. <PERSON> Nuckolls </PERSON> said small amounts of methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana were purchased both on and off the laboratory site during the 1986 probe. Two of the individuals prosecuted had what the lab director termed `` Q-clearances'' giving them access to certain top-secret buildings and materials. One of those with top security clearance made drug deliveries in the super-sensitive plutonium building, <PERSON> Nuckolls </PERSON> said. Lab management and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have been under criticism, accused of terminating the investigation prematurely. `` The laboratory's security investigators and the undercover officer strongly opposed the decision to terminate'' the probe in September 1986, <PERSON> Nuckolls </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which participated in the investigation, also opposed the decision, said <PERSON> Nuckolls </PERSON>, who was appointed director in April. Energy Undersecretary <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigative subcommittee last month that officials decided to terminate the investigation `` because it had run for eight months and was apparently not uncovering new productive leads.'' He said the operation had served its purpose in putting <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> employees on notice that drug use would not be tolerated. In addition to the six workers prosecuted, 10 others, including five with Q-clearances, resigned when confronted with evidence of illegal drug activities, <PERSON> Nuckolls </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nuckolls </PERSON> said allegations also were gathered on 36 additional workers, but an internal review found insufficient information to warrant disciplinary action. The lab director said two follow-up reviews concluded that Operation Snowstorm was conducted professionally and competently. <PERSON> Nuckolls </PERSON> acknowledged that a review by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was sharply critical. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee has asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to review how effectively the lab controls government property, including classified documents, high explosives and nuclear material.

At least 78 people were arrested. `` We've made a strong statement that homeless people are going to get off their knees and fight for their rights,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Flagg </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless, minutes before he and 10 others were arrested Thursday while occupying a vacant townhouse in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Voter registration drives also were a part of Homeless Action Day, a protest that organizers said involved at least 60 cities nationwide `` I'm not really all that far out of the mud, but I can still see a little bit better than some of these people,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dized </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, construction worker who said he used to be homeless. `` I'd be less than I am if I did n't support this. I've been through it; I know what it's like to want a home. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, two policemen and a demonstrator were injured in a fight that erupted after demonstrators tried to occupy a boarded-up <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redevelopment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> building. Some of the 75 people who marched on behalf of the homeless used crowbars to pry boards off the building, and when police tried to stop them, they swung the boards at the officers, police spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Santry </PERSON> said. Eighteen people were arrested, including one who was charged with disorderly conduct and possession of a dangerous weapon. Three others were charged with assault and battery on a police officer. Thirty-seven people were arrested when they blocked traffic near the Capitol in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, including <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Violence </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the protests.

<HEAD>Iran Plans New Oil Platform in Persian Gulf</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is building a new oil platform in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and sophisticated equipment being installed behind its armor plating could spell more trouble for shipping, shipping executives said today. The platform will have landing pads big enough to handle two large helicopters and one small one at the same time, the executives said. It also is being reinforced with steel plating, they said. The executives, who spoke on condition on anonymity, quoted Iranian officials as saying the platform will become a base for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fleet of oil shuttle tankers serving the <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> export terminal in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. But some shipping industry experts say it also could be intended for military purposes, including the electronic monitoring of shipping traffic and warships traveling through the strait, where some Iranian attacks on neutral shipping occur. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> used drilling rigs as military communications bases in the past, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. Three have been destroyed or damaged in attacks by American warships _ one in October and two more on April 18. The attacks in each case were in retaliation for Iranian military actions against American-related ships and aircraft in the gulf, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television reported that the new triangular-shaped rig will be capable of `` coordinating sea and airborne attacks upon the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'' and refueling helicopter gunships and patrol boats. The shipping executives said the facilities, including cabins for about 200 workers, should be completed in 45 days. Some shipping industry officials expressed skepticism that the platform was for military use. `` The term armor-plated is exaggerated. They are reinforcing it with steel, but they are not turning it into a tank,'' said one. He added that the Iranians probably would arm it with anti-aircraft guns, as they have other oil platforms in the gulf. Foreign tankers pick up oil cargoes brought to <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, in the northern gulf, by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fleet of state-owned and chartered tankers. Despite being nearly 1,000 miles from <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> bases, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> raided <PERSON> Larak </PERSON> several times. Its most recent attack was May 14, when warplanes wrecked a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> tanker and damaged four others, including two huge ships used to store and transfer oil to other tankers.

 Wholesale prices one step short of retail rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June, the government said today. But the drought searing much of the nation sent prices for raw food soaring at their steepest pace in more than 2 -LCB- years. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said raw costs jumped 4.2 percent last month, a rate not seen since the 5.1 percent climb of October 1985. Further along in the wholesale process, however, prices for foods ready to be retailed rose 1.1 percent, reflecting earlier, though less severe, increases in raw food costs. Some examples of price increases at the unprocessed-food level: _ Wheat, 25.3 percent _ Corn, 24.3 percent _ Turkeys, 22.8 percent _ Soybeans 22.0 percent _ Chickens, 22.5 percent Reflecting the fact that many farmers are slaughtering animals they can not afford or find feed for, cattle prices fell 5.2 percent while hog prices were down 4.0 percent. The news was not quite so severe at the finished-goods level. Prices for eggs rose 16.0 percent while turkey prices gained 9.3 percent, chicken prices jumped 7.3 percent and fresh fruit costs gained 6.7 percent. Those gains were partially offset by a 5.7 percent decline in vegetable prices and a 2.2 percent decrease for rice. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottman </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said that prices of foods made from grain, such a vegetable oils, bakery products and pasta, likely will continue to rise, and that the drop in vegetable prices wo n't last. Meat prices should continue to fall through late autumn, but will then head higher after the drought-induced slaughtering tails off, he said. `` Next year we'll probably see the full impact of the drought, particularly if it persists. Up until this week we could say, ` Well, if we get some rain, we'll probably be all right.' But this week is the last week we can say that,'' he said. Energy prices, meanwhile, fell at the finished level by 1.6 percent. Leading the way was a drop of 7.1 percent for fuel oil while declines of 2.4 percent and 1.0 percent were posted for gasoline and natural gas respectively. Further energy price declines are considered likely because crude oil prices have fallen over the last month to their lowest levels in nearly two years. `` We can just thank our fortunes that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ca n't get together on restraint of production. I hate to think what the report would look like if oil prices were rising,'' <PERSON> Kottman </PERSON> said. In other economic news: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit rose slightly in May to $ 10.9 billion, but the imbalance was still the second smallest in almost three years The gap between imports and exports widened by $ 627 million from a revised April imbalance of $ 10.3 billion. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June, the ninth consecutive month without a The June increase, boosted by an increase in electricity use during the heat wave, pushed industrial output 5.8 percent higher than it was a year ago. _ Business inventories in May rose a moderate 0.6 percent to $ 728.4 billion, held in check by a 0.9 percent jump in sales to $ 483.7 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Overall, if the June increase in wholesale finished goods prices held for 12 straight months, the inflation rate would be 4.6 percent annually, more than double the 2.2 percent rise of 1987. Subtracting the effects of volatile food and energy prices, wholesale prices rose 0.3 percent last month. Analysts consider this rate a better indication of the economy's underlying inflation Even with steep food price gains anticipated for the several months, many economists feel the effect of those gains will be only temporary. For the first half of 1988, prices one step short of retail rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, wholesale costs rose 4.0 over that period. Prices from March through June have risen at a monthly rate of either 0.4 percent or 0.5 percent. At the finished level, the department gave these other price changes: _ Passenger car prices, up 1.0 percent _ Women's clothing, up 1.0 percent _ Home electronic equipment, down 2.2 percent _ Cosmetics, down 0.6 percent The June increase brought the wholesale price index for finished goods to 107.9, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 in 1982 would have cost $ 107.90 last month, 40 cents more than in May. This calculation is not adjusted for seasonal variations, as are other calculations in the report. The Consumer Price Index, which tracks services and imported goods not included in the wholesale price report, has risen at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.4 percent over the first five months of the year, the same rate as for all of 19878. Consumer price figures for June will be released next week.

 Authorities in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> are preventing vehicles carrying foodstuffs from reaching a breakaway region of their republic and have imposed an economic blockade on the mostly Armenian area, a local journalist said today. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency blamed the supply problems on a strike in the disputed region, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. It said more than 130 railway cars loaded with supplies were sitting at the train station in <LOCATION> Stepenakert </LOCATION>, the region's main city. More than 300 containers with foodstuffs have not been unloaded, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The journalist from the state broadcasting authority said an airliner was forced to turn back to neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on Thursday after <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> authorities refused to let it land in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. `` There are no more fruits or vegetables in our shops,'' the journalist said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. `` We have almost no economic ties now with <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>.'' The legislature of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, an enclave the size of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> whose 160,000 inhabitants are mostly Armenian, voted Tuesday to secede and join <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The Azerbaijani government called the vote illegal and declared it void. `` We are under a virtual economic blockade,'' said the journalist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` The Azerbaijanis are trying to morally kill our movement, to strike down our just demands.'' For the past two months, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has been disrupted by strikes by ethnic Armenians who want to be united with the Armenian republic. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> followed suit with strikes on July 4 demanding the annexation. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that the situation in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> remained tense. A general strike in the city continued. The journalist said none of the city's 20 factories was working and that bus service between <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> and the Armenian cities of <LOCATION> Kirovakan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kafan </PERSON> was suspended. Buses to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, however, were setting out every other day with an escort of police brought in from the <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> region of southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, he said. On Thursday, an Aeroflot airliner en route from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> was forced to turn back after <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> authorities refused to let it land in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the journalist said. The airliner touched down in the Armenian city of <LOCATION> Goris </LOCATION>, and passengers returned to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> by bus, he said. The journalist said `` several thousand'' troops were patrolling <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> today but that the area was quiet. A resident of <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> said Thursday the ethnic dispute had taken a heavy toll. `` Our situation is very bad because the strike is continuing. No one is working,'' said the woman, who hung up the phone before giving her name. She said <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> residents had to rely on food produced locally. `` We are n't receiving food from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>,'' she said, but `` we get some potatoes from the <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> area.'' Activists said more than 150,000 people held a rally Thursday in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> urging <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s 10 deputies to the Soviet parliament to press for annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. About three-fourths of the enclave's residents are ethnic Armenians, most of them Christians, but the region was assigned to predominately Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923. Armenians believe the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the highest legislative body in the Soviet government, will meet Monday to consider the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> question. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> said such a meeting was likely but that he did n't know when it would occur. <PERSON> Khovik </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasilyan </PERSON>, an Armenian activist, said by telephone from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> today that most of the Armenian capital's factories were still strikebound but that transport was functioning normally in the city of 1.1 million people. He said another rally in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to press Armenian demands for annexation was planned Saturday. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, said Thursday the work stoppage in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> had cost $ 65 million in lost production and that $ 29 million worth of construction had not been completed. Thirty-two people were killed in ethnic riots in February at <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, 26 of them Armenians. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that about 20,000 Azerbajanis living in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> had fled to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and that as of Wednesday, 7,265 Armenians who once lived in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> cities had returned to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>.

In response to the boycott, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> board members voted Wednesday not to hold any meetings in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> until the political unrest in that country settles down.

 Iranian gunboats struck a Liberian-registered tanker in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> today and returned twice more to attack it after the captain called for help from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships, gulf-based shipping executives said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> responded to the distress signal but did not confront the raiders, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said.

They said the captain put out his distress signal at about 2 p.m. and gave his location as five miles south of <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> island. The captain said the attack was carried out by two Iranian gunboats. He was heard frantically shouting, `` American warship! Americans warship!'' and within minutes he reported that the gunboats were `` returning to attack,'' said the executives who monitored the radio calls. The captain was still shouting for help when the gunboats returned a third time to raid the vessel, said the executives. They said the attacks occurred within about 15 minutes. The attacks caused a fire, which the crew extinguished. In a radio telephone contact after the Iranians turned back, the captain was overheard by monitors as saying the Iranians attacked three times, and he described the condition of his ship as covered with `` lots of holes.'' He was overheard saying `` no casualties, thank God,'' but he also said that his second officer suffered minor injuries. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the tanker issued a call for help but was able to steam west under its own power. When it reached international waters, it no longer required assistance, the statement said. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in the gulf, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the frigate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was on patrol in the gulf more than 20 miles away and responded to the call and headed toward the tanker. The Iranian gunboats did not pursue the tanker into international waters, said the spokesman. The shipping executives, who also spoke on condition they not be named, noted that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship would not cross the 12-mile territorial limit around <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>, which would be Iranian waters. Under the existing rules of engagement for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, vessels in distress can be assisted only in international waters. Since May 3, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rules of engagement have been expanded to permit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to intervene to stop attacks on neutral shipping in international waters, if the ships under attack are not carrying war-related materials and if they ask for assistance. It was the second raid by the Iranian gunboats in four days on a tanker in the vicinity of <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>, a stronghold for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s paramilitary Revolutionary Guards About 550 commercial vessels of different nationalities have been caught in the tanker war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> attacks ships sailing in Iranian waters and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> retaliates by raiding neutral shipping, particularly vessels linked to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accuses the two countries of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, its foe in the nearly 8-year-old war. On Tuesday, the Iranian gunboats raided a Panamanian-registered tanker, the 81,282-ton Universal Monarch, about 20 miles off <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>, setting its engine room ablaze and causing extensive flooding. The missile frigate <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>, on patrol in the area, had rushed to the assistance of the vessel and two of its helicopters took fire from the raiding gunboats. No casualties were reported. The raids on the Universal Monarch and the Sea Victory were <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s apparent retaliations for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> strikes on two tankers _ the Greek-owned Fellowship L and the <ORGANIZATION> Cypriot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ray </ORGANIZATION> _ a few days earlier in the vicinity of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s vital <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oil terminal, also in the northern part of the gulf.

 A federal appeals court today sided with the city of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in a dispute with demonstrators who wanted to march on a street adjacent to the Democratic National Convention site. Alternative'88, a coalition of protest groups planning to demonstrate during the convention next week, went to court after the city refused to allow parades on <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> adjacent to the convention site. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Orinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> ruled last week that the city has a significant government interest in guaranteeing delegates' access to the convention and therefore was justified in barring parades outside the Omni Hotel and the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> World Congress Center The coalition appealed to the 11th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, arguing that `` if traffic problems can be a compelling reason -LRB- for limiting demonstrations -RRB-, then in fact the sidewalks and streets are not held in trust for the use of the public.'' The appeals court today upheld the lower court's ruling, noting the city had given permission for demonstrators to march within one block of the convention site. `` The visibility of the parade from the actual convention site is not significantly diminished'' by holding it a block away, the court said.

 Former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> says if <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can team up with someone as philosophically different from him as <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, then <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should be able to patch up any differences with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, in a memo to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, recommends <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as a running mate for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain Republican nominee. However, the former president also has kind words for Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, calling them `` strong choices.'' A copy of the note from the former president, who lives in <LOCATION> Saddle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> confirmed <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> wrote it for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` key strategists. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said he received the memo late Thursday. `` I'm reading it with great interest,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> _ with diametrically different views on key issues _ can get together, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who have no significant philosophical differences, can get together, too,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> wrote, adding: `` Compared to the Democratic ticket, they would look like Siamese twins.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had some harsh exchanges back when they were rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. But <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> says even if `` the pundits say'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> do n't get along, the two have a similar outlook and would make an effective team. By contrast, he wrote, differences between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, `` run to the heart of virtually every major economic, social and foreign-policy issue.'' `` One is tall. The other is short,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> begins, ticking off what he views as Dukakis-Bentsen differences. On such issues as tax cuts, gun control and aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, the two are as politically polarized as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the former president wrote. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> brushed aside comparisons between the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket and the 1960 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> combination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, which beat the ticket of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>. `` They overlook a profound and obvious difference,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> were both mainstream Democrats.'' He accused the Democrats of being `` willing to bury their differences even if it means burying their principles'' in order to have a shot at winning <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which he called `` the big enchilada.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> described <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as `` a mainstream Democrat'' but said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` definitely is not.'' `` He is a card-carrying member of the <LOCATION> McGovern-Mondale </LOCATION> wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said of the Democratic nominee, referring to former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and former Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, whom <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> beat in 1972. The former president said the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp was `` inept'' in failing to reach <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and tell him of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s selection before the word got out. But he said it will be in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s own political interests to stage a reconciliation with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp. In an aside, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> described <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a `` fire-breathing radical'' who has `` put on a three-piece suit and run for president.''

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and leaders of the six other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations today began a two-day summit expected to focus on disarmament and East-West dialogue. The meeting provided <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a showcase to inform his fellow communist leaders in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on the latest developments in Soviet `` perestroika,'' or restructuring. It was the first of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> political-consultative council since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held their summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in early June. The leaders met in closed session and issued no information on their deliberations. While they met, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, traveled to southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to the former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp at <LOCATION> Auschwitz-Birkenau </LOCATION> and placed flowers there in memory of the 4 million people who died at the camp. The camp, about 140 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, was liberated by the Soviet Red Army on Jan. 27, 1945. In June, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> exchanged ratified copies of a treaty to ban short - and intermediate-range nuclear weapons, most of which are deployed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> With the accord settled, attention has shifted to long-stalled talks to reduce conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has indicated that would be a top item on the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders' agenda The pact meeting should `` point out the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>'s priorities in disarmament,'' said a commentary Thursday in the official Polish daily <ORGANIZATION> Zycie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warszawy </ORGANIZATION> Conventional arms talks resume in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> this fall, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Monday that informal talks be held to search for a new starting point that could lead to progress. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>, as parties to the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, attach special importance to the quickest possible inauguration of negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said a joint Polish-Soviet communique issued Thursday. Both countries favor `` removing disproportions ... in this area -LRB- and -RRB- are ready for a realistic and constructive dialogue,'' the communique added. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> contends the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc holds a dangerous 2-to-1 advantage in tanks, artillery and armored personel carriers deployed near the borders separating East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In a speech to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, the first day of his six-day visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed withdrawing an unspecified number of `` analagous'' <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> air forces if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> agreed not to deploy 72 U.S.-built F-16 fighter-jets in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has proposed that all armies leave foreign territories across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by the year 2000. It was <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s turn to host the annual session, held in the stately Council of Ministers palace where the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Treaty was signed in 1955. Five East bloc leaders arrived in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Thursday, joining <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. They are <PERSON> Nicholae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceaucescu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honnecker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and newly appointed <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The pact has been going through a period of ferment in recent year, partially as a result of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies and his emphasis that each member country is free to choose its own path toward restructuring. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are enthusiastic backers of reform. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> take a cautious approach, while <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> shows only grudging interest in conducting similar reforms. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Ceaucescu </PERSON> continues to wield great centralized control, is conspicuously out of step with the reform trend.

 A sailor convicted of murdering and robbing a payroll officer aboard a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyer was spared the death penalty and given life imprisonment after proclaiming his innocence. Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> was sentenced Thursday by a five-member court-martial panel. He was convicted Wednesday of killing Lt. j.g. <PERSON> Ratish </PERSON> <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> aboard the USS Hancock at dock here March 15 and stealing $ 94,000 from the ship's safe. Colon, who had a 14-year military career as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> military policeman and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> electronic warfare technician, faced the death penalty because he was found guilty of murder while committing a robbery. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has not executed one of its members since 1849. The sentence came after 34-year-old Colon, who did not testify at his four-day court-martial, read a statement urging panel members to reconsider the verdict. `` There was no one more surprised at your findings than myself,'' <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> said. `` I was surprised for the simple fact that I did n't do it.'' Colon, of <LOCATION> Vega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, pointed out loose ends in the investigation such as several other suspects who failed polygraph examinations when questioned about the killing and theft. Colon was charged with taking more than $ 94,000 and 2,575 blank <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury checks. He was arrested April 12 after investigators found more than $ 87,000 and the checks in a safe-deposit box rented in his name. `` If you are all convinced Petty Officer Colon is the perpetrator, death is not appropriate,'' defense attorney Lt. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Michels </PERSON> argued. `` Make Petty Officer Colon live with it the rest of his natural life.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit rose slightly in May to $ 10.9 billion, but the imbalance was still the second smallest in almost three years, the government said today. The good news sent the dollar soaring on foreign currency markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the gap between imports and what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> sells overseas widened by $ 627 million from a revised April imbalance of $ 10.3 billion. The revised April trade deficit was the best showing since a $ 9.9 billion deficit in August 1985, and the new figure for May is the second best performance since that time. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the report `` represents good news in the continuing trend of reducing the international trade deficit.'' `` There is less deterioriation there than the markets had expected, so the market reaction should be favorable,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Financial markets, which have been thrown into a tailspin by bad trade figures over the past year, reacted favorably to the good news. The dollar rose almost one cent against the British pound and nearly one Japanese yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading immediately after the trade figures were reported. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investment firm, said the slight widening in the deficit for May had been expected because the April number was held back by an unusually low import figure. He predicted the trade deficit would move into single digits in coming months as the country's trade problem continues to show improvement after seven consecutive years of steady deterioration. `` After the last few months of volatile movements, it was nice to see only a small change,'' he said. `` We should have smooth sailing for the rest of the year.'' Imports did rise in May compared to April, climbing 3.4 percent to $ 37.6 billion. But this increase was offset by a 2.3 percent increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, which rose to $ 26.6 billion, very close to the record level for exports set in March. Analysts said the May trade figure was welcome news, proving that sharp drops in the deficit in March and April were not flukes. The figures were also good news for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which is counting on strong export growth to propel the economy in this presidential election year. For the first five months of the year, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, after adjusting for normal seasonal variations, has been running at an annual rate of $ 140.7 billion, down substantially from the record deficit of $ 170.3 billion run up last year. The improvement has come from a boom in export sales, which for the first five months of this year are running a remarkable 30.4 percent above the same period in 1987. Imports were also up by 11.4 percent during the same period, reflecting in part price increases caused by the decline in the value of the dollar over the past three years. The administration in 1985 embarked on a coordinated strategy with other major industrial countries of devaluing the dollar as a way of curing the country's trade problems. A weak dollar makes American goods cheaper and thus more competitive on overseas markets while making imports more expensive for American consumers. The strategy took much longer than expected to show benefits, but the administration is confident that the trade imbalance for 1988 will decline, marking the first annual improvement in eight years. The increase in exports in May reflected a $ 0.3 billion rise in agricultural shipments, a $ 0.3 billion advance in sales of capital goods and a $ 0.1 billion rise in sales of American autos and parts overseas. The rise in imports reflected increases of $ 1.1 billion in industrial supplies and smaller rises in imports of capital goods. Imports of autos fell by $ 0.6 billion during the month. Oil imports rose 17.7 percent during the month to $ 3.9 billion. By country, the biggest deficit, as usual, was with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an imbalance of $ 4.1 billion, down slightly from the April imbalance of $ 4.4 billion. The substantial trade improvement has been a key factor in the better-than-expected economic growth the country has enjoyed so far this year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing has been enjoying boom times because of a surge in export sales. The growth in manufacturing jobs helped to push the unemployment rate down to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June. Many economists believe almost half of the economy's growth this year will come from an improving trade performance. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, senior financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that he was not concerned that recent increases in the value of the dollar would slow the long-term trend for an improving trade deficit.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today applauded overwhelming <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes condemning Sandinista leaders for human rights abuses and urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve swiftly further aid for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, speaking for the president, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` is pleased with the overwhelming, bipartisan votes'' on the issue. `` These votes send the message to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is firmly committed to the achievement of freedom and democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The Sandinistas' conduct makes clear that they will not institute democratic reform and cease their threats to the security of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> unless effectively pressured and persuaded to do so,'' the spokesman said. `` To achieve democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and security for all of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> clearly requires a viable and effective Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance,'' he said. `` When the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns, the president hopes they will move swifly to enact legislation currently being formulated in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for further aid to the resistance,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 385-18 on Thursday to condemn <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government for `` brutal suppression of basic human rights. It urged the democracies of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to meet to assess the situation. The House action followed closely on the 91-4 roll call by which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday night adopted a stronger resolution warning that military aid to the Contras could be approved if the Sandinista government continues to frustrate democratic reforms and does not end human rights abuses. Both resolutions condemn the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> for breaking up a recent peaceful demonstration, jailing more than 40 people, including opposition leaders, closing down the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station and expelling <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and eight other American diplomats. Military aid was ended last February, but a $ 47.1 million aid package containing $ 20 million for military purposes was introduced late Wednesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. The White House on Thursday expressed support for the combined humanitarian and military aid, which would last through next March. Under the measure, aid to the Contras would be authorized only after the president certifies that it is necessary and after both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approve it. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Thursday that the White House was working with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a new Contra aid bill and said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has been `` very helpful'' in this effort. When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked Wednesday whether he was supporting efforts o get a new Contra aid package through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he responded, `` You bet I am.'' Advocates of ending military assistance contended the step would encourage the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and Contras to negotiate seriously and to cooperate in the Central American peace process fostered by Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. American humanitarian assistance to the Contra forces has continued. Until the Sandinista crackdown last weekend there had appeared to be virtually no prospect that military aid to the Contras would be restored. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appeared divided on the issue on Thursday. `` I expect this body to take stronger action later,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>, echoing many of his colleagues. `` This resolution contains strong words; but it is just that _ strong words,'' he said. `` There are no teeth in this resolution.'' But Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., also speaking for many of his colleagues, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should do nothing to fuel further fighting in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> said that while it is important to `` condemn any violations of the principle of democracy,'' he believes there is still life in the peace process. `` The basis for progress, I believe, still remains,'' he said. In Senate testimony, Ambassador <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said he believes congressional resolutions do little to sway the Sandinistas. <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said he does think `` the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are impressed with any evidence of resoluteness on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and evidence of bipartisan resolve.'' But he added, `` I think the Sandinistas are impressed more by actions than by words.''

 Sixty-four House Democrats are asking Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to commit himself to a strong <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> space program to encourage young people to pursue science and engineering careers. `` The present administration has allowed our space program to lose direction and founder,'' said a letter handed to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Wednesday by Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, whose district includes <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lewis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. She had originated the letter and circulated it among the others for their signature. `` We as Democrats believe that our party must pick up the fallen torch of space exploration and carry it high,'' it said. `` The next president will have the choice of leading <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to a permanent presence in space or allowing other, more ambitious countries to surge ahead.'' The letter said that a successful space program needs a well-educated workforce but that young Americans are n't pursuing the necessary studies. `` More than half of all graduate degrees earned in science and engineering at American institutions go to foreign nationals,'' it added. `` A strong civilian space program provides incentives for young people to pursue a career in science and or engineering and is necessary to ensuring a sturdy American technology base.''

Delegates of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurisdictional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> De </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kalb </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, on Thursday selected the Rev. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, 43, to serve as bishop for the 9.1 million-member church, the second-largest Protestant denomination. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> was elected on the 28th ballot by 339 votes. `` I am touched in the deepest of ways by the confidence my <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> colleagues have placed in me, a confidence in the possibility of my giving leadership through the episcopacy,'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> said. Her election came one day after delegates to a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurisdictional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> elected the Rev. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> a bishop in a surprise move. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s name was forwarded as a candidate in the sixth round of balloting Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurisdictional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buckhannon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>.

The <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and North-central conferences were among five regional conferences the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> held this week.

 About 1,500 striking workers from a bankrupt food processing plant met with government officials in the capital Friday and returned home after winning a promise of higher pay. More than 5,000 of Agrokomerc's 8,500 workers went on strike Thursday, demanding more pay in the latest labor unrest caused by the government's economic austerity plan. About 1,500 of the workers rode on buses to <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, where they were met by hundreds of police officers who sealed off an area around <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Shouts of `` Let's March to Parliament!'' and `` We Are Not Moving Anywhere!'' went up from the Agrokomerc workers as they pressed for wage increases and more state investment in the company. The workers are receiving guaranteed minimum salaries of about $ 50 monthly, `` which is not enough for survival,'' <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasalic </PERSON>, the head of the company's trade union, was quoted by <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio as telling government officials. `` Our children are hungry and have no clothes to wear,'' he said. After meeting Bosnian and federal leaders in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the Agrokomerc workers, who appeared tired and dejected, said they won a promise of a raise to $ 70 a month. They then boarded the 25 buses to take them back home. Agrokomerc is in the <LOCATION> Bosnia </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Velika </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kladusa </LOCATION>, 250 miles west of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. Some of the workers wore the traditional headscarves and colorful oriental trouser-skirts of the area. On Thursday, truck drivers blocked all traffic in <LOCATION> Velika </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kladusa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ekspres </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. Agrokomerc, once touted as a model Socialist enterprise, is being sold off gradually to cover debts incurred after it circulated about $ 1 billion worth of uncovered promissory notes. The financial scandal, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s biggest since World War II, was uncovered in August. Only 8,500 of the company's 13,000 workforce are still on the payroll. Workers throughout <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> are experiencing hardship as the government implements an austerity program designed to reduce 175 percent inflation and limit the $ 21 billion foreign debt. On July 6, thousands of workers from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest rubber and shoe plant broke into the parliament building to press demands for higher pay.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> on Friday accused <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of trying to undermine the 1988 Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> by threatening war. The command made the allegation in response to North Korean charges that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were using the Olympics as a cover to create a `` war machine.'' `` The world will not be deceived or misled,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` Your attempts to contrive an atmosphere of danger on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula, in a transparent attempt to undermine the upcoming <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics, will not succeed,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Command is made up of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 15 other countries that fought on the side of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the 1950-53 Korean War. The Korean peninsula has been divided into the pro-Western South and the communist North since 1945. The command has repeatedly charged that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is trying to create military tension to try to disrupt the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in September. The North has made a series of accusations in recent months. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> demanded to co-host the Games, but international Olympics authorities refused. The North has said it will boycott the Games, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities fear possible sabotage. <PERSON> Pendley </PERSON> rejected North Korean charges of tension in the Demilitarized Zone, the line separating the two Koreas. He said the fact that North Korean soldiers were working on roads, dams and sports facilities in the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION> indicated a lack of tension. The chief North Korean delegate, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, said that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called the meeting to protest a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> buildup of troops, missiles, aircraft and tanks. He claimed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were preparing for war. He cited as examples the recent visits of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aircraft carriers the USS Midway and the USS <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> to the area. `` The Olympics is not sponsored by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and it's not responsible for its security,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has 42,000 troops based in the South under a mutual defense pact against the North, is to help protect the Olympic Games in September and plans to deploy aircraft carrier groups off the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula.

<HEAD>Little-Known Work Brings Record; Turner Flops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a turnabout of fortune at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s art auction house Friday, a little-known work brought 16 times the artist's record price but one by the illustrious J.M.W. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> did not meet its minimum and was withdrawn. The Turner, a dreamy landscape in oil called `` Cicero at the Villa,'' was among the last works by the English artist, who lived from 1775-1851. It had been expected to break the record for the artist of 7.37 million pounds -LRB- $ 12.3 million -RRB- but the highest offer of 6.2 million pounds -LRB- $ 10.3 million -RRB-, was short of the minimum fixed by the owner, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>. `` Two Leopards Playing'' by the 19th-century Swiss artist Jacques-Laurent Agasse, on the other hand, sold for 3.85 million pounds -LRB- $ 6.44 million -RRB-. Agasse's previous record was $ 385,000. He produced the oil, which went to a telephone bidder, in 1808 for an English patron. `` The market's always full of surprises and sometimes it goes both ways,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanham </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s. `` We're pleased that the Agasse has done so well and obviously disappointed about the Turner.'' One reason for high expectations about the 1839 Turner work was that most of his paintings are in museums. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Montefiore </PERSON> of the auction house said <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s expects the painting to be sold later through a private offer from a buyer whose name was not revealed. The previous record for an Agasse was set in June 1987 with the sale in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> of `` Lord Rivers Coursing on <ORGANIZATION> Newmarket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heath </ORGANIZATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Montefiore </PERSON> said interest in `` Two Leopards Playing'' was high because the artist's works are `` very rare.''

 While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bakes under record-breaking heat waves, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has been sloshing through another cool, wet summer. The sogginess, which optimists call unseasonal, has slightly dampened the tourist trade. But for some parched visitors from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it's becoming an attraction. According to the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Weather Center, southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was drenched with 1 -LCB- times the average amount of rain during the first two weeks of July. Temperatures have been several degrees below normal, the center says, and there has been only 80 percent of the normal amount of sunshine. `` It's pretty bad,'' said a spokesman at the weather office, who requested anonymity in keeping with civil service rules. `` We've had three fairly poor summers in a row If we keep on going, it'll be a fourth. That prospect worries some in the tourism business. At the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Copsey </PERSON> said attendance is `` slightly down'' because of the weather. `` We're obviously hoping that August will be nice,'' she said. The sentiment is shared at Guided Tours of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which conducts walking tours of the British capital. An employee there said because of the weather, `` We're finding that -LRB- people are -RRB- not turning up.'' But overall, British tourism officials say, the gray skies and tepid temperatures have n't kept foreign visitors away. `` As far as overseas visitors, the weather does n't affect numbers,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most people coming to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> expect to get bad weather.'' But bad is in the eye of the beholder. American tourists questioned at random said they found the wet, cool <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> weather a welcome change from the searing heat in parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I came from a 105-degree heat wave and I'm very happy to be here,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogg </PERSON> of Fair Lawn, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. Standing in a long line outside a tourist eatery under a sky threatening yet another downpour, Ms. <PERSON> Fogg </PERSON> said she was not disappointed with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s notoriously bad weather. `` I was told that it would be rainy,'' she said. Her 14-year-old daughter <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> chimed in: `` I love it. It's great to be out of the heat and be in the coolness. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tichenor </PERSON>, chaperoning a group of students from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, admitted it would be nice to have had some sunshine. But she added: `` It has n't disappointed us that much. We brought umbrellas. We brought a lot of them.'' To Britons, the occasional sunny day is becoming a novelty. But <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> official, sees a silver lining in the rain clouds. `` For people from some parts of the world,'' he said, `` our weather is a novelty, part of the attraction.''

 A woman who said she has received graphic letters and telephone calls from readers of three `` swingers'' magazines has filed a $ 4.5 million lawsuit against the publications, claiming they ran her address in ads without her permission. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mize </PERSON> sued the publishers of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>, Southern Swing Fever and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> for Loving People, according to the lawsuit filed this week in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>. As a result of the advertisements, <PERSON> Mize </PERSON> has been `` inundated with a voluminous amount of letters, cards and photographs'' from readers containing graphic expressions of their sexual practices, the lawsuit states. <PERSON> Mize </PERSON> also has received many anonymous calls, according to the lawsuit. Neither <PERSON> Mize </PERSON> nor her attorney, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, would discuss the lawsuit Thursday. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>, an employee of SSM Publications of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, which publishes Southern Swinger, said she believes <PERSON> Mize </PERSON> may be getting the mail of a couple who had <PERSON> Mize </PERSON>'s post office box before moving. `` This couple has placed numerous ads with us. They recently moved to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and are placing ads with us from there,'' <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> said. SSM President <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollingsworth </PERSON> said about 90 percent of those placing ads are `` liberal-minded professional couples looking for other liberal-minded professionals.'' Another ad giving <PERSON> Mize </PERSON>'s post office box appeared in <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fever </ORGANIZATION>, a magazine published by <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, with a nude photograph of a woman with her face scratched out, according to the lawsuit. The woman in the photograph looks similar to <PERSON> Mize </PERSON>, but is not her, the lawsuit states. There were no listed telephone numbers for either <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> or his magazine in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shapiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday he was n't aware of the lawsuit and could n't comment.

<HEAD>Heavy Snowfalls Kill 10, Trap 50,000 in Lesotho</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Heavy snowfalls have trapped 50,000 people in the mountains of <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> and many are without food, firewood and proper clothing, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Ten people have been found dead in the past week, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> report monitored in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Nearly a dozen young boys who shepherd flocks in remote areas of the mountains died in similar snowfalls in September, when the tiny kingdom surrounded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> appealed for blankets, rescue equipment, fuel and food from the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> government. A sick man who died before he could be taken to a hospital, and three children who fell into a dam died in the <LOCATION> Maluti </LOCATION> mountains earlier in the week. The bodies of three men and three children who died from exposure in the <LOCATION> Letseng-La-Terai </LOCATION> area of the <LOCATION> Mokhotlong </LOCATION> district were discovered Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> helicopters have flown over the <LOCATION> Mokhotlong </LOCATION> district, where all roads have been closed by the snow. South African vehicles have been brought in to scrape paths into the mountain villages. `` Thousands of people have been cut off from the outside world for a week and they have run out of food and firewood. Many people have begun eating snow to stay alive,'' said Radio <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` In many places the children have no shoes, and only one blanket to protect them from the cold.'' It noted that when the snow begins to melt, conditions may worsen, because access roads will be washed out, as they were last year. The heaviest snowfalls in years also have cut off towns and villages, disrupted road, telephone and electricity links in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> and eastern Cape provinces. The main road from the central <LOCATION> Johannesburg-Pretoria </LOCATION> area to <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> is closed, leaving thousands of motorists stranded, and about 100 hikers have been trapped in the <LOCATION> Drakensberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Radio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> reported. It said the <LOCATION> Karasberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have received the heaviest snowfall since 1965.

 The space agency announced Friday it has transferred custody of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> space rocket launch complex and <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> launch operations to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The transfer ends an era during which <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> launched 143 Deltas from two pads at Launch Complex 17 in 28 years. An additional 38 launches have been conducted from <ORGANIZATION> Vandenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas-built </ORGANIZATION> rocket has achieved a 95 percent success record, orbiting more than 60 communications satellites, 30 weather satellites and dozens of payloads for science and Earth resources research. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s first Delta launch here on May 13, 1960, failed, but the second, three months later, orbited the Echo communications satellite. The agency's last launch, on Feb. 8 this year, sent a Strategic Defense Inititive payload into space. The agency still has one <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> rocket remaining in its inventory. It will boost a scientific satellite next year from <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last year endorsed a private-sector commercial launch business using unmanned rockets and directed <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to purchase launch services from companies like <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>. In April 1987, the space agency transferred its authority over the Atlas-Centaur space rocket and Launch Complex 36 here to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>. Until the transfers of the two rockets, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had purchased the boosters from the companies and had acted as its own launch agency. Now it must buy launch services from the companies. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plans to use the two <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> launch pads here to launch SDI and other military payloads with <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and advanced <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 rockets purchased from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>. The first <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 launch is scheduled here later this year. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> will negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for the use of the pads to launch <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 commerical payloads, with eight such launches planned from 1989 to 1992. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also plans to take over <ORGANIZATION> Atlas-Centaur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Launch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION> 36 to launch an advanced model of the rocket with military payloads. General Dynamics then will negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for use of the two pads there for commercial satellite launches.

<HEAD>Shultz: U.S. Should Not Cut Back High Technology To China</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Asscoaited Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said on Friday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not try to stop the Chinese from selling arms to <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> nations by slowing high technology sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, on his second day in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said there were other, constructive ways to persuade the Chinese not to sell the weapons. He was responding to reporters' questions about a published report that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had agreed to sell intermediate-range, M-9 missiles to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, an enemy of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Chinese leaders told him their only ballistic missile sales in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> have been to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. More than 100 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen sent <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> a cable Thursday warning that future transfers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high technlogoy to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would be `` jeopardized'' if the sale to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> went through. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he got word of the cable only after his meetings with top Chinese leaders. He met privately with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. `` I think the way to try to get at it with the Chinese is other kinds of constructive ways,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported on Thursday that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had agreed to sell intermediate range M-9 missiles to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Senior <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials traveling with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> have said the Chinese are believed to be marketing the weapons, which have a maximum range of about 370 miles, but there are no indications of a final sale. The officials say the M-9, which would be capable of striking targets in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if launched from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, is at least nine months away from production and that a prototype is still being tested in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He said the Chinese had not promised to halt ballistic missile sales to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but the subject was still open to discussion. `` We did n't come to any agreements about it, but ... I'm sure that the subject will continue to be an important one on our agenda,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters. Angry over alleged Chinese sales of anti-ship Silkworm missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last fall temporarily tightened regulation of high-technology sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also has been critical of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s sale this spring of intermediate-range CSS-2, or East Wind, missiles to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. On Saturday, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> flies to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the seventh stop on a nine-country trip through <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Discussions in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> also focused on the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the Chinese-backed Cambodian guerrillas who some fear may muscle their way back into power. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> massacred hundreds of thousands of fellow Cambodians while in power during the mid-1970s. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ousted them when it invaded in 1978. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have `` a very broad agreement as to certain aspects of that situation,'' including `` rather similar views'' on stopping a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> comeback. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> officially supports a three-party Cambodian opposition coalition that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Although the Chinese have said little publicly about the Cambodian problem during <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s visit, the American side has strongly indicated that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is sensitive to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> dilemma and willing to do something about it. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said both countries are pressing for a total pull-out of Vietnamese troops and both view Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> as the central figure in a future Cambodian government. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> abruptly resigned this week as head of the anti-Vietnamese coalition. There have been several proposals, including one from <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, for a peacekeeping force to ensure a cease-fire, the peaceful formation of a government and free elections in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has pledged to remove all its troops, currently estimated at 120,000 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources, by 1990. This has led to fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> would shoulder aside their two, less powerful non-communist allies in the anti-Vietnamese coalition and seize power once <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s forces have left.

 There is one well-known Democratic politician of Greek ancestry from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> who is not seeking the presidency and is n't even going to the Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` I have no political ambitions, whatsoever,'' says former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON>, once hailed as a liberal maverick on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` We're much happier now than when I was in office.'' He has scaled down his aspirations since he disclosed that he had cancer and left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> one month before his 43rd birthday. The last traces of cancer are gone, but he prefers the limelight of this old mill town to the spotlight of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Though no longer a senator, <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON> still makes headlines in The Sun, a 55,000-circulation daily that serves his hometown. It has been reporting his doings ever since he sat on the <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1960s and right on through his election to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1974, first Democrat to win the district in about 90 years, and to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1979. One recent edition landed on <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON>' side porch carrying an article about his tangle over the ouster of the <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> school superintendent. He also created a statewide stir recently when, as the head of a study commission on the environment, he called for a building moratorium on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. The matter, which will be on the November ballot, is still being hotly debated. <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON> enjoys watching his friend, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, reach for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in particular because the likely Democratic presidential nominee expounds <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON>' philosophy that the Democrats' survival depends on integrating the needs of business. `` Liberals have to be concerned with economics. Democrats have to be the friends of business. ... The major issue facing the country is the sense of decline, that we're going to be some latter-day <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' he said. Although he once floated the idea of running for president, it's enough for <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON> to stump for his friend to know he is n't missing a thing In some ways he prefers wielding influence as an ex-senator. `` I'm really struck by how much respect there is for the office of senator,'' he said. `` It is very special ... and you can use that. How many 47-year-old former senators do you know? `` Certainly in people's dealings with me, they are much more accepting of me now than when I was in office. I have no political ambitions, so I'm less tainted. Also, there's the illness issue.'' In September 1983 he was diagnosed as having non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a relatively mild cancer of the lymph nodes that attacks part of the immune system. Nearly four months later, in the middle of his second run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON> decided it would be better for everyone if he took his wife, <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON>, and their three daughters home to <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>. Since then he has undergone a bone marrow transplant and has been declared cancer-free. <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON> works for a prestigious <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> law firm, <ORGANIZATION> Foley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>, making deals and serving on corporate boards and taking pro bono assignments. His latest battle, over his proposal that construction on the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> be halted until the peninsula gets control of development, has led to abuse from builders and developers while filling his mailbox with letters from <PERSON> Cape </PERSON> <PERSON> Codders </PERSON> telling him to stick with it. `` I know I'm doing well because my political enemies are angry at me,'' he said, with glee, recalling the wrath of a roomful of developers at a public hearing on the issue. `` Six hundred people were shouting at me!'' He shrugged. ` I have nothing to fear, politically, and, with what I've been through ...'' `` The day I turn around and there's nobody behind me, is the day I get out of it. The mail I get is so passionate, you can not read that mail and say: ` I'm going to walk away.'''

Their flight aboard shuttle Atlantis is scheduled for November and will carry a classified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payload. The crew patch for the first post-Challenger flight _ that of Discovery in early September _ shows a stylized shuttle lifting off and includes in the background a sun and the seven-starred Big Dipper as a tribute to the seven astronauts who died in the Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986.

<HEAD>Burglar Takes Steaks _ Nine Times</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A burglar has been serving himself at a restaurant, repeatedly making off with 14-ounce steaks from the freezer, and the owner is cooking up a stakeout. `` That's all they take is steak. I just do n't know what to think any more, because they've gotten away with a lot of it lots of times,'' said <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON>, owner of The Hoffbrau. The steakhouse was burglarized this week for the ninth time this year, police said. <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON> said the haul has totaled hundreds of steaks. Police are interviewing witnesses, Sgt. <PERSON> Jerold </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidl </PERSON> said. `` There appears to be a pattern. It sounds like someone is getting full on steak.'' Sixty 14-ounce, top sirloin steaks were taken after 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, when someone broke in through the front window of the restaurant. `` The alarm went off when he broke the window, but he went straight to the icebox and got out before police got here,'' <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON> said. `` He's pretty brave to do that on Sixth Street on a busy night.'' <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON> said 50 to more than 100 steaks have been taken each time the restaurant has been hit, and the thief also has broken in through the ceiling and the kitchen window. `` I had to put burglar bars on the side windows and would rather not do that to the front, but I may have to because it's running up there,'' <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON> said. He estimated his losses at $ 5,000 to $ 7,000, including repairs on broken windows.

 Saying that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest resource `` is the genius of our people,'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today presented medals for advances in science and technology to 30 individuals prominent in research and industrial technology. In a brief ceremony at the Old Executive Office Building, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that the most important activity that his administration can do is `` knock down the barriers to progress.'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest resource is not the land,'' said the president. `` No, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest resource is the genius of our people.'' Earlier, one of the winners, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said in an interview that heart disease may be controlled within a generation through a wider acceptance of healthier lifestyles and the development of drugs now in the laboratory. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said he expects that people who are genetically susceptible to heart disease eventually will be identified through blood tests, and that the number of people killed by heart attack will be reduced dramatically. `` We may control heart disease before we thoroughly understand it,'' said <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>. He said he and other scientists now are tracking down the precise genetic factors that lead to the development of atherosclerosis, the major form of heart disease. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said this could lead to a blood test that would enable doctors to identify patients most at risk for heart attack long before any heart disease has developed. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, also of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, won the Nobel prize for discovery of the basic mechanism controlling the formation of cholesterol, a major element in the development of heart disease. Twenty of the medal recipients received the national medal of science, an honor established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1959 to recognize achievements in physical, biological, mathematical, behavioral, social or engineering sciences. In addition to <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, those receiving the science medal are <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomory </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Armonk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calabasas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilleman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Housner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberger </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Rosalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yalow </PERSON>, Mt. <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is awarding the national medal of technology to 10 people.

 He marched with <PERSON> King </PERSON>, won election as <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s first black congressman since Reconstruction and later championed human rights as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Now <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s mayor and chief booster, using the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> as a hometown showcase for the sales pitch he makes around the world. With 13,000 reporters in town or on the way, Young is scheduling daily news conferences in contrast to his usual practice of scheduling none. As a prominent black Democratic office-holder, he came under early pressure to endorse <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. But he steered clear, saying that as host mayor for the convention he should n't be taking such stands. `` I'd like to see <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> have a worldwide reputation as a market center,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` We've been trying to find ways to create jobs and to wipe out some of the problems of poverty in our city by actually attracting and generating new wealth.'' Young's emphasis on improving <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with private investment has won enough support from white business leaders to have him thinking aloud about a run for governor next year on a platform of economic development. But the mayor also bears some bruises from charges he has forgotten the poor while courting the rich. `` I think he has been good for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as a whole, bringing in business, but I do n't think the low-income community looks at him as being good for them,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Watley </PERSON>, president of the tenants' association in the Carver Homes housing project. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said he was wounded when Ms. <PERSON> Watley </PERSON> invited him and the news media to a tenants' meeting and then issued a scathing `` indictment'' of him, starting 90 minutes of accusations by project residents that he had failed them. `` It really hurt because these are people who have always been my close friends and supporters,'' he said. He also said his administration has brought jobs to the area around Carver Homes and money for improvements in the project itself. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the incident has changed his outlook on handling such functions _ `` I'm not a sucker and I'm not going to make myself available to get set up any more'' _ but not his emotions about dealing with criticism from the poor. `` I grew up middle class, so from early childhood I had to deal with the question of middle class guilt, and I found it not very productive. So you have to maintain your sense of responsibility, your sense of vision and hope, but not pay much attention to your critics,'' said the 56-year-old mayor. Young, trained as a minister, was a top aide to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. After King's death, he won a congressional seat in an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> district. Then came his tenure as <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, giving him an international reputation. Since his election as mayor in 1981, he has circled the globe in search of new business for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. He displays a hands-off approach to the day-to-day running of the city. `` Basically my style is to get intelligent and dedicated people, get them committed to a vision and in a certain direction and then give them all the support I can,'' he said. Young himself has plenty of supporters. `` We were losing a lot of investment to the suburbs, and we've seen a lot of investment come back into the city'' during <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s administration, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweat </PERSON>, who recently concluded 15 years as president of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION>, a downtown business The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> skyline bristles with new development, and the mayor can rattle off projects worth several billion dollars, still on the drawing boards. `` It's beyond the comprehension of most of us,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Loudermilk </PERSON>, a businessman and lifelong Atlantan who usually votes Republican but was an early supporter of Young. `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> has to get a tremendous amount of the credit because all of us feel good about ourselves, our businesses and our city, and frankly that was not true when <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> came in,'' said <PERSON> Loudermilk </PERSON>. `` He has an ability to open any door in the world,'' he said. `` I was with him in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and we met with -LRB- President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON>, the mayor and all of the ministers and bankers, and -LRB- Young -RRB- is an absolute, absolute world hero.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police major was appointed Friday as the state's first anti-drug czar, a move Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> hopes will bring <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s drug problem into the open as a first step toward recovery. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 43, will chair <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s Drug Policy Task Force and coordinate drug-war efforts among local state and federal agencies. `` This is not a study commission. This is a recommending, implementing group,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` What this policy unit does it takes the drug problem out of the closet. It used to be and still is in many areas, ` Let's not acknowledge it because it's bad for tourism, it's bad for business.''' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> has been director of <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION>'s substance-abuse control program since its inception in March 1987, coordinating interagency, school and private-sector efforts against drugs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> chose him mainly for that experience. `` No agency can do it alone,'' said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` What you're seeing much more than ever before, is law enforcement stepping forward ... and saying we are aware that law enforcement alone can not solve the problem. That has brought agencies together.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> has 22 years of experience in police work. He was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from 1964-71, and while a member of the <LOCATION> Metro-Dade </LOCATION> force has been district manager for <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, an area torn by riots, drugs and poor economy He will remain a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> force but will be on loan to the state to protect his pension, said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. He will continue to collect a salary of $ 70,300. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, director of operations in the govenor's office, said $ 125,000 has been earmarked for the new office.

<TEXT>
 A Marine with one lung today neared the final leg of a 146-mile run from scorching <LOCATION> Death </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the lowest point in the contiguous 48 states, to the summit of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION>, the highest point. Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, 42, began his grueling trek at 8 p.m. Wednesday. He was expected to reach the end of the paved road and the start of the trail to 14,464-foot <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> before noon, forest Ranger <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Trowell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> faced a 10.3-mile hike up a well-worn but extremely steep path to the summit. The steepest part of the trail is between 12,000 and 13,700 feet, where even the most experienced hiker struggles with the thin air. The Marine ate salty foods, drank large quantities of water and took caffeine pills to stay awake but was suffering from cramps and nausea. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, who lost a lung to a bullet in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1966, said the run was for fun and to inspire other disabled veterans. He planned to run nonstop, going from 282 feet below sea level to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION>'s summit, in hopes of shaving five hours off the record of 45 hours, 15 minutes. He appeared likely to break his personal best time: 63 hours, 12 minutes in 1986. He took two eight-hour sleep breaks during that run. As his figure, blurred by heat waves, bobbed down the road Thursday, his wife, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>, followed in an air-conditioned mobile home. `` I have been thinking about just yanking him into the car and driving home,'' she said. She begged her husband to eat more tuna sandwiches. `` They're a miracle cure _ lots of salt.'' His run came during the hottest season for <LOCATION> Death </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, with the daytime air temperature often reaching 120 degrees and the sand 200 degrees, said Death Valley Acting Chief Ranger Russell March.

<HEAD>Jackson's '88 Delegates Recall '72 Convention Fight With Daley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 What a difference 16 years can make. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the solo remaining also-ran in the field of candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, had to wage a bitter fight just to win a seat on the Democratic convention floor in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in 1972. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> remembers. One of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s allies at that time _ just as she is one of his delegates this time _ she was so pleased with the rebels' victory at that steamy convention that she took a plunge into a swimming pool with her clothes on. `` It was that kind of excitement,'' she says. `` It was a great day.'' The challenging bloc of four dozen renegade delegates faced contempt of court and jail for pursuing their fight. Even after they won, it took a 9-0 decision by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to nail down the victory. And the event may have played a role in the demise of the political operation led by then-Chicago Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, one of the most powerful big city political machines in the country. Mrs. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, 64, chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a West Side group in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, is headed to the convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with at least four other <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> delegates who were with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and then-alderman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> in the rebel group in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Here's how it happened: A week before the 1972 convention, the party's credentials committee, which leaned toward <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, granted the Singer-Jackson delegates convention seats on a 71-61 vote. That decision was challenged on the first day of the convention, a session which lasted well into the next morning. The challenge failed in a floor vote. The memory still rankles <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, one of the ousted <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> delegates. `` It was one of the most monstrous things I've ever seen,'' said <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, 57, a former state senator. He said he and other delegates received thousands of votes, `` and we were replaced by ... people who met in somebody's living room. ... It was a theft.'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1972, had helped set the stage for the spectacle of keeping <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> from the convention floor. After the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where anti-war demonstrators rocked the city and clashed with <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s city police force, <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> chaired a commission that rewrote party rules to make room for more minorities, women and young people. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, under <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s leadership, flagrantly violated every aspect of the rules,'' said <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate this year who was an alternate with the 1972 rebels The renegades held their own caucuses so they could offer an alternative. The anti-machine Democrats in the city knew that a simple protest would result in either a meaningless rebuke to the <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> forces on the convention floor, or expulsion of the 59 <LOCATION> Daley </LOCATION> people, leaving no representation for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> saw the quickly called meetings as a political charade. Singer agrees that his delegates, chosen in church basements and living rooms, were not picked in orthodox ways. But `` I do n't think there was anyone in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> who did n't know what was going on,'' he said. After the credentials committee action, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> forces went to court, and <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Covelli </PERSON> prohibited the Singer-Jackson delegates from taking their convention seats. He threatened to jail leaders of the group if they disobeyed. Still, the rebels went to the convention, and faced a challenge on the floor. That vote `` shaped up as the most dramatic moment of the 1972 convention,'' according to `` Clout: Mayor <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and his City,'' a 1975 book by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> reporter and commentator <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. `` The power of the old guard was under challenge.'' <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who was keeping in touch with the delegation from his vacation home in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, would not agree to offers to split the delegate seats or take over leadership of the renegades himself. When the floor vote was taken, the Singer-Jackson group kept their seats. Critics said the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> rift would hurt <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>'s chances. Maybe they did, but he lost 49 states, including <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Covelli </PERSON>'s contempt-of-court order was stayed pending an appeal. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> later refused to hear the case, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled 9-0 for the Singer-Jackson group. The high court said that a political party has the right to make and enforce its own rules. That ended the threat of jail. Singer is n't convinced that the 1972 events led to the downfall of <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s machine. But Mrs. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> thinks it was one step on the path of opening political power in the <LOCATION> Windy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to those who had been shut out. `` I think it sort of ... changed the whole politics of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' she said.

 A federal judge today refused to provide a sealed government affidavit to attorneys for defense consultant <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a key figure in the massive defense procurement investigation. Meanwhile, a federal magistrate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> ordered the government to unseal four other search warrant affidavits. However, he delayed the unsealing until 5 p.m. EDT and the government said it would appeal the decision. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacheris </PERSON> overruled a magistrate who last week told <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s attorneys they could see the 61-page affidavit so long as they showed it to no one else, including <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>. `` The court finds the magistrate's ruling is clearly erroneous,'' <PERSON> Cacheris </PERSON> said. He agreed with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s arguments that the government's case could be hurt by premature disclosure of the affidavit, which outlines the government's case and provides a wealth of detail about why investigators are looking into activities of <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON>. The affidavit was used by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents to conduct searches of <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s house and office. The government's sensitive investigation involves national security issues as well as <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Cacheris </PERSON> said. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s attorney, said he was disappointed with the ruling and was considering whether he should appeal <PERSON> Cacheris </PERSON>' decision to the <ORGANIZATION> 4th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> argued that the Paisleys and their lawyers only wanted the affidavit to satisfy `` idle curiosity.'' But he said the papers should remain sealed so the government can complete its probe. He promised <PERSON> Cacheris </PERSON> that the affidavit would be released to the public within about a month. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a former assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, is one of 40 people and companies that have been identified as targets of the massive investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 150-billion-a-year procurement process. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the search warrants ordered unsealed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> were executed on June 13 and permitted government to search the offices of <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and the home of defense consultant <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>. `` We are talking about the foundations of our country, the defense of our country,'' <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> said in ruling on motions by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Copley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I've come to the conclusion there is this right of access, to obtain things lodged with the court, prior to the return of an indictment,'' he said. The investigation centers around allegations that defense consultants paid bribes to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials to obtain information that would help contractors secure government projects. No charges have been filed in the investigation, but grand jury subponeas have been issued to numerous people, including <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister today accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of making excuses but not accepting responsibility for its destruction of an Iranian jetliner and the deaths of the 290 people aboard. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> should leave the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to avoid future tragedies like the shooting down of <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Flight 655. It said an international <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> fleet should replace the American warships. As the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resumed debate on the July 3 incident, the Soviets, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> all called on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to accept a year-old council resolution calling for a cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali-Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said at a news conference that `` the attitude of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration is similar to a rich man's son who drives when he's drunk. He thinks money can buy everything, and that is not true.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offered to pay compensation to the families of the victims but said it did so out of humanitarian concerns and not because it is legally obligated. <PERSON> Velayai </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer would be acceptable only `` within the context of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepting responsibility for shooting down the Iranian airliner.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces shot down the airliner because they thought it was an Iranian F-14 jet fighter. During debate, the Soviet representative, <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozinskiy </PERSON>, said `` the tragedy has demonstrated once again that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fleet must leave the waters of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> right away.'' `` How can one regard as self-defense the destruction of a passenger airliner flying within an established air corridor many thousands of kilometers from the borders of the power that is allegedly defending itself?'' he asked. British <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> expressed his country's `` profound regret'' over the loss of life but said the underlying cause of the disaster, and of all war-related casualties in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refusal to accept the cease-fire resolution <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> never decisively rejected the resolution but has insisted that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> be branded the aggressor in the war as the first step toward peace. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s representative, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Brochand </PERSON>, said `` the international community can not pass judgment on such a tragic error without the results'' of an inquiry by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION>'s governing council agreed Thursday that such an inquiry should be conducted. `` We should of course take into account the conditions prevailing in the region ... a region for years fraught with insecurity because of the Iran-Iraq war,'' <PERSON> Brochand </PERSON> said, in calling on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to honor the cease-fire resolution. The debate adjourned until Monday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> requested the council meeting to seek condemnation of the USS Vincennes' downing of the Airbus A300 over the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> and to demand withdrawal of all American forces from the gulf. It has not been able to muster the votes for a condemnation. On Thursday, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the incident a `` terrible human tragedy'' but said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> shares responsibility. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a legal right to protect <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> shipping lanes. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the 15 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> agreed that council President <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogueira-Batista </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> would draft a document in consultation with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the members, which include the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said it was not known whether the document would be a resolution, which requires a vote, or a statement from the council president adopted by consensus, which carries far less weight. The move was considered a confirmation that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had failed to persuade a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members to pass a resolution denouncing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and the USS <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> had skirmished with Iranian attack boats just before the jetliner entered the area. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the airliner did not respond to repeated questioning by the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> about its identity, and the cruiser's captain believed it was an F-14 transmitting ambiguous signals and descending in attack pattern `` After seven unanswered warnings,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, the captain `` did what he had to do to protect his ship and the lives of his crew.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> read what he said was a transcript of a communication between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Air Flight 655, flying from a military-civilian airport at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, across the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, and the <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> control tower just before the attack. The transcript contained no warnings from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> or communications with it. `` The shooting down of an Iranian civil airliner, flying on a scheduled flight known to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships, and using an internationally established and published civilian airway and transmitting signals identifying itself as a civilian airliner could not have been a mistake,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I will not dignify with a response the charge that we deliberately destroyed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Air 655.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal magistrate ordered the government today to unseal documents outlining the basis for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> portion of its probe of fraud in the defense industry. The government immediately appealed. The public has a right to know about matters of such interest and importance, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> said in ruling on requests by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Copley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> chain and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are talking about the foundations of our country, the defense of our country,'' <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> said. The documents in question are affidavits filed in support of search warrants. In the court papers, investigators set out the wrong they believe has been done and what they seek in their searches. The warrants were used June 13 to search the offices of <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and the home of defense consultant <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>. They were among 33 search warrants executed across the country that day. At the request of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> delayed the unsealing until 2 p.m. The government then said it was appealing the ruling to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>, who scheduled a hearing for 2 p.m. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> had argued that disclosure of the affidavits would alert targets of the investigation and might encourage them to destroy documents. He also contended that the First Amendment right of access applies only after a defendant has been arrested or indicted. The investigation, which became public last month, centers on allegations that defense industry consultants bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for inside information useful in winning win multimillion-dollar contracts. If <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON>'s order stands, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> would be the third city, after <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, in which sealed documents detailing aspects of the probe were made public. In <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, today, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District judge rejected a similar unsealing request by attorneys for consultant <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a former assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary who is a key figure in the probe. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s home and office were searched. <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> adopted the position argued by attorney <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Heincke </PERSON>, representing the Times, who said the outpouring of publicity on the defense fraud probe in the last month makes the sealing unwarranted. `` It's important that these people that want to know, this small band of people that read the papers, can feel they have some say to check up on what people in all three parcels of our government are doing,'' <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> said. The magistrate said citizens are entitled to ask, `` are we just throwing our money away when we buy these defense programs?'' `` Corruption, bribery, these are things that go to the heart of how our government functions,'' he said. <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> disclosed that one of the affidavits has been misplaced by the court clerk's office `` for no sinister reason'' and may not be available. <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, had also urged at the hearing today that the affidavits be unsealed to allow him to properly defend his client, who he said has been `` effectively put out of business'' by the seizure of all his business records.

<HEAD>Iranians Attack Tanker Near Farsi Island</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Speedboats attacked a tanker that passed within five miles of the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> military stronghold Friday, but the ship escaped with minor damage as an American missile frigate raced to its aid. `` No assistance was required'' when the <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> reached the 85,989-ton Sea Victory in international waters, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` She went within five miles of <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> and they came out to get her,'' he said. `` She turned tail and ran straight out. They went back home and left her alone.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the warship could not have defended the tanker close to the island because <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> `` rules of engagement'' allow intervention only in international waters and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognizes a 12-mile limit around <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>. Shipping executives said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is preparing a new oil platform in the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> equipped with facilities that suggest military purposes, possibly defensive, as well as civilian. A radio report from the Liberian-registered tanker's Greek captain said the speedboats attacked three times, making `` lots of holes,'' starting a small fire and slightly wounding the first mate. It was the second attack in three days near <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> in the northern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Iranian Revolutionary Guards use the island 60 miles off <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> as a base for attacks on neutral commercial shipping from speedboats armed with machine guns and grenade launchers. Attacks in the area have increased recently after months of comparative calm. Gulf shipping executives said the Iranian raids apparently were reprisals for two Iraqi air raids on Iranian tankers last week. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> raids tankers owned or chartered by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an attempt to stop the oil exports with which its enemy finances the 8-year-old war, and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> responds with attacks on ships trading with gulf <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states. More than 500 ships have been attacked by both sides. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters and Iranian speedboats exchanged fire Tuesday after the boats attacked a Panamanian-registered tanker west of <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilots said one boat may have been damaged. On Friday, the Sea Victory was bound for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> when speedboats attacked at about 2 p.m., and the captain issued a distress call. The <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, on patrol 25 miles away, replied and sped toward the reported location. When the two vessels met less than an hour later, the fire was out and the Sea Victory was in no danger, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` There was no involvement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces with the gunboats and no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters entered territorial waters. We do not violate territorial waters of any country,'' he said. Although military officials said the distress message was a `` general Mayday call,'' shipping executives quoted radio monitors as saying the tanker asked `` American warships'' for help. The informants said later the captain shouted, `` We want the navy! We want the helicopters to chase them away!'' Under the broader `` rules of engagement'' that took effect two months ago, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships may intervene in attacks on ships of non-U.S. registry if they request help, are not connected wth either of the belligerents and are in international waters. Before that, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> could offer armed protection only to U.S.-flag ships. Shipping executives who mentioned the new Iranian oil platform said any military role might be strictly defensive. The platform, under construction in a port on the Arab side of the gulf, will have electronic gear, radar and landing pads to handle three helicopters at once, and steel plating, apparently to protect it from attack, the executives said. They quoted Iranian officials as saying it would be an administrative base for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fleet of shuttle tankers delivering oil to the <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> export terminal in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. The informants spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has used oil platforms as military communications bases and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces demolished three, one last October and two on April 18, in retaliation for attacks on ships and helicopters. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television said equipment being installed on this platform could make it an offshore base `` capable of coordinating sea and airborne attacks upon the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.'' Some shipping executives agreed it could monitor traffic and be a base for speedboat or helicopter raids, but were skeptical that its main purpose was military. `` The term armor-plated is exaggerated,'' one said. `` They are reinforcing it with steel, but they are not turning it into a tank.'' He said it probably would have anti-aircraft guns to help protect <PERSON> Larak </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air raids.

<HEAD>GOP Candidate and Treasury Secretary Vacation in Wyoming</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On the eve of the Democratic National Convention, Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his chief political mentor, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, are going fishing. Whether the two plan to spend 4 -LCB- days in the wilds of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> also casting for a prospective GOP running mate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides are n't saying But, the aides suggest, draw your own conclusions on what the talk may turn to when the fish are n't biting. The vice president and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> leave for <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> on Saturday, and will remain there until Wednesday morning. Then, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to hit the campaign trail hard, with events scheduled during the final two days of the Democratic convention _ a break with tradition _ and on through the next weekend. Sources said the two will be fly fishing in the <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in northest <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> _ which covers a lot of territory. Campaign spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> says she has no idea where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will be. The closest town, she said, is <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>. `` You're looking at someone with zero knowledge,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, who says she think she's being kept purposely in the dark on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s whereabouts. `` It's the last chance he'll have in many years to have a few days of normal vacation. He deserves it,'' she said. Normal vacation it is n't. Besides having with him the man soon expected to become his campaign chairman, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be taking along a small <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> contingent and communications officers to keep him in touch with the White House. And, because it's deemed an `` official'' vacation rather than a campaign trip, taxpayers will be picking up the tab for the flight out on Air Force Two. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides also say there'll be a forest ranger along as a guide. `` He's the vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and he will be in touch if he needs to be,'' said vice presidential aide <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. `` He's not going to drop off the face of the earth.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> are not taking their wives on the vacation. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will spend most of the time at the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s seacoast retreat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` Happy campers are all boys,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. It will be a change of pace for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who does most of his fishing in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> in his 27-foot powerboat off <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>. `` He is in a great mood at the prospect of reaquainting himself with fly fishing techniques,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is a longtime friend and political adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He ran <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1980 presidential campaign and was senior counsel to the 1984 Reagan-Bush re-election campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign sources say they expect <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to resign as treasury secretary to join the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign as its senior official, most likely in early August, just before the Republican convention. Although the two administration officials themselves have been tight-lipped on specific plans, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> makes it no secret that he already relies on <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> unofficially for campaign advice. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> does not dispute this. `` I return my telephone calls,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in a recent interview. There had been speculation that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would be staying at a cabin near Cody, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, on the South Fork of the <LOCATION> Shoshone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> owned by Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., a close friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s and among those mentioned as a possible running mate However, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said Friday that the vice president would not be staying there and that <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> had no plans to join the fishing trip. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will reappear on Wednesday, the next-to-last night of the Democratic convention, with two campaign apperances planned in the the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area.

<HEAD>Superconductivity Products For Sale Within 3 Years, Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Products using superconductivity may appear on the market within three years, but it will take a decade or more for major applications of the technology, a prominent researcher said Friday. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> commented in an interview after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> awarded him and 19 other researchers the national medal of science. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also awarded the national medal of technology to 10 prominent leaders in the technical industries. <PERSON> Chu </PERSON>, cited in the award description for a series of discoveries that helped raise the temperature of superconductive materials, said the new technology probably will be on the market in the form of special batteries and smoke detectors within two to three years. Microelectronics, electrical switches and other thin film electrical connectors will probably benefit from superconductivity within five years, <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> said. `` But any large scale application is at least 10 years away,'' he said. He predicted that by the end of the century superconductivity technology will be applied to the transmission of electricty and in large magnets. Superconductivity is a material state that permits electricity to flow without resistance. For decades, this was thought to occur only in metals chilled to temperatures approaching absolute zero: minus 459.6 degrees Fahrenheit. But <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> and other researchers, experimenting with ceramic compounds, have discovered how to raise the minimum superconductivity temperature to about inus 243 degrees, a temperature easily maintained with relatively inexpensive liquid nitrogen. Experts believe the technology will permit the manufacture of large, powerful magnets that could be used in transportation and medicine. The technology also could substantially reduce the cost of electricity since about half of generated power is lost to transmission resistance. Also, superconductivity could speed up computers and permit the more efficient storage of electricity. <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> said many nations now are racing to develop superconductivity technology and it is not clear who has the lead. He said he could not predict which nation would make the first practical application of the new technology, but `` I am very impressed by the Japanese effort.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in presenting the medals, said it is vital that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continue to promote research into emerging technologies that will have a major influence on life in the future. The president praised the medal winners as the `` men and women who are leading us into the new age of technology'' and that one of the most important jobs of government is `` knocking down the barriers of progress.'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest resource is not the land,'' he said. `` No, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest resource is the genius of our people.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave 20 researchers the national medal of science, an honor established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1959 to recognize achievements in physical, biological, mathematical, behavioral, social or engineering sciences. In addition to Chu, those receiving the science medal were <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomory </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Armonk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calabasas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilleman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Housner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberger </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Rosalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yalow </PERSON>, Mt. <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, N.Y.

<HEAD>Tass: Afghan Rebel Rockets Kill 20 In Kabul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Afghan rebels fired more than 20 rockets into residential areas of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Friday, killing 20 people, wounding 34 and damaging a mosque and other buildings in the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> capital, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The 5:30 a.m. attack, which <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> denounced as `` barbarous'' and a `` crime,'' was the latest reported on a major population center in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Fighting has spread throughout the rugged and mountainous country as the Soviets withdraw their troops. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> also reported the attack on residential areas of the Afghan capital. The dispatch was monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. However, Afghan guerrilla leader <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> the insurgents do not target residential neighborhoods. He said the 15 to 20 rebel targets in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, which include the airport and Soviet Embassy, are not residential areas. <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> claimed Afghan government troops and their Soviet backers fire rockets into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s residential districts to discredit the guerrillas and undermine their burgeoning popular support. `` We fire five rockets, and suddenly, we see 20 hit,'' <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> said, disavowing responsibility for all bombardments in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` monstrous'' to suggest Soviet forces would fire on a city they still occupied and said one of the 21 rockets launched on four <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> neighborhoods Friday exploded next to the Soviet Embassy. A label on one undetonated missile showed it came from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, speaking to members of the armed forces, said Wednesday the insurgents have become bolder as Soviet troops depart. Under an accord signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> committed itself to begin withdrawing its more than 100,000 troops on May 15, and to complete the pullout by Feb. 15. Half of the Soviet soldiers are to be home by August. `` More than 35,000 Soviet internationalists have returned to their country,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said in a speech broadcast by official <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio and monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said: `` Armed interference in the internal affairs of our country ... is not only continuing, but has intensified. ... The extremists engage in savage crimes against peaceful people.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said villages in the provinces of <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paktika </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> were heavily bombarded by the insurgents Thursday and that at least five people, including three children, were killed. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said a land mine planted by guerrillas exploded Thursday in a crowded bazaar in <LOCATION> Rodat </LOCATION>, 30 miles from the border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Two people were killed and one injured. More than 150 civilians were reported killed last weekend when the anti-Marxist rebels, aided by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, used artillery and rockets to shell populated areas in more than eight provinces. On July 8, a car packed with explosives blew up near a downtown movie theater in the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, killing 31 people and injuring 33 others, Soviet and Afghan media said. The Soviet withdrawal places the burden of warfare on the Afghan army, a force many Western observers believe will be unable to withstand the guerrillas. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, however, said Afghan troops had staged several `` successful operations'' against the rebels recently. It said the army wiped out an insurgent detachment of more than 20 fighters and captured three people who planned to commit `` terrorist acts'' near the southern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that about 100 anti-government guerrillas were killed in the past week and that large quantities of weapons were seized, including rocket launchers, mortars, machine guns, grenade launchers and three U.S.-made Stinger missiles, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Soviet and Afghan officials maintain they are abiding by the U.N.-brokered accords on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. They have used increasingly tough language in accusing <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which is also a signatory, of blatant violations. In particular, the Soviets say <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is allowing its territory to be used to supply the rebels with weapons and ammunition and as the home of a rival Afghan government. State-run Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on Friday of `` crude violations'' of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON>, told a government news briefing Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> may reconsider its obligations under the agreements if the violations by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> continue. However, he shied away from mentioning any potential Soviet reaction. The commander of Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, said in a newspaper interview published Sunday that the violations could force his country to reconsider the withdrawal timetable. The Kremlin sent tanks and troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to preside over the replacement of one Marxist leader by another. The Soviets stayed on to fight the guerrillas in a brutal war in which more than 13,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers lost their lives.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> avoided stirring new controversy between himself and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Friday as his `` Rainbow Express'' caravan rolled South, leaving ripples of attention along the highways. The caravan, bound for next week's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, included seven buses and an equal number of cars. Inside were about 120 reporters and photographers, 30 or so supporters and about a dozen delegates, staffers said. They arrived in <LOCATION> Lousiville </LOCATION> at mid-day for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to have lunch at an inner-city church. As he entered, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ignored shouted questions from reporters about a possible meeting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He planned rallies in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, Friday night. Construction workers stared curiously at the buses festooned with banners and posters, and knots of people gathered each time the motorcade swept into a city. At rallies along the way, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> focused on mobilizing his supporters, though the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention is sure to nominate <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice of <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for vice president. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> battled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the presidential nomination for months, then lobbied for the No. 2 slot. In the midst of a tense, week-long focus on relations between the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camps, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> concentrated on the Republicans and their expected nominee, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We survived <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, we can survive anything,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We're getting ready to send <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> back into private life.'' In meetings with reporters, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he'll meet with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` at an appropriate time.'' Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> could help mediate `` at the appropriate time.'' For the moment, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> seemed content to work on his convention speech and prepare for a showy arrival in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Saturday. His was the first bus in the caravan, equipped with a kitchen. He was accompanied by his children and advisers. Wife, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, was helping prepare for his arrival. `` She was wise enough to fly to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We're not picking up passengers; we're registering,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Because of travel time, we're not encouraging additional passengers.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did draw distinctions between the credentials of an anointed leader of the party, and his own role. `` I may never get the leader label,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` But leaders have followers and support.'' `` When I look at those who have been to the White House and those who are trying to go ... I may or may not get there, but I'm qualified,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said

<TEXT>
 Looking back on nearly eight years as president, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said with a short, dry laugh that his greatest achievement may have been staying alive. The 77-year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chief executive, who was shot in the chest in 1981, commented in the second of a three-part series on his presidency broadcast Friday on British television's independent Channel 4. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the public attitude toward <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> changed after the assassination attempt. `` You may not agree with him. You may think he's too simple.. not a man of the world, but there is a sense of conviction about him,'' <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON> said. `` A strength of character emerges in the shooting which transforms his presence.'' The 50-minute program called `` Walking Tall'' covers <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term It starts with former aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> recalling that he found his boss sleeping under a mound of bedcovers on the morning of his inauguration, Jan. 20, 1981. `` I said, ` Governor.' There was kind of a grunt,'' <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> said. `` And I said ` Good God, in an hour and a half you're going to be sworn in as the 40th president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.' He rolled over and said, ` Do I have to?'.'' Much of the program focused on assessments by political analysts and former members of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration. To <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff, `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is the most presidential man I've ever known. That will be his principal legacy. And by that I mean he knows exactly who he is. He is president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and he has no trouble with that. He is not offended by it, upset by it or intimidated by it.'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, a long-time adviser, said: `` Nobody in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics has better style and form than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Philips </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> political group, called him `` the most typical, the most American, the most average _ but in a good sense, in a likeable sense _ president we could ever imagine.'' The president's policies of increasing defense spending, cutting social programs and refusing to raise taxes came in for tough criticism. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked how he responded to the fact that he never balanced the budget and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now is the world's biggest debtor nation `` I'm just as critical of it as I was before I got here,'' he replied. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, former treasury secretary and chief of staff, said the president never discussed economics or finance with him. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made budget cuts almost impossible. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, the former budget director who urged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to raise taxes, had a harsh assessment: `` After time, when the full extent of the damage is clear, and the heavy price we will pay for years to come is evident, historians will record Reaganomics as the singular greatest episode of sustained economic mismanagement in the 20th century history of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> called that `` sour grapes on the part of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>'' and added: `` He never got what he wanted, which was solely to have taxes raised. ... That was not an antidote to get us out of recession'' in 1982. Some of the first term's major events were shown, including the assassination attempt, the October 1983 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> barracks in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that killed 243 military personnel and the invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> two days later. Recalling the assassination attempt, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` I heard what I thought was firecrackers. ... I did n't feel a bullet hit me.'' When asked what was his greatest achievement, he said: `` Sometimes I think,'' then laughed and continued, `` just staying alive.'' Even <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s critics praised his ability to control the media. `` These people have understood that they have a powerful instrument of news management in their hand,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neustadt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and author of `` Presidential Power,'' who described <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s mastery of the photo opportunity and disdain of formal news conferences.

 Anyone looking for the RCA Building entrance on Sixth Avenue next year is in for some confusion. They changed the name of Sixth Avenue to the Avenue of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> years ago; early next year, they're changing the name of the RCA Building, the 70-story landmark in the center of Rockefeller Center, to the G.E. Building. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> purchased RCA and its network television division, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, two years ago.

<HEAD>Military Administration Cuts West Bank School Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The military administration said Friday it would end the school year in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in a week, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> students complained they would lose a month of studies and fail their final exams. Also Friday, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official blamed prolonged army curfews and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> commercial strikes for cash shortages in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The official, who requested anonymity, also reported problems in the delivery of food supplies to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s refugee camps. But he said no one was going hungry in the strip, where 650,000 Palestinians live. In another development, an 18-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was wounded in the leg during a clash with soldiers in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Bureij camp, a local reporter said. The army said it was not aware of the incident. A spokesman for the Israeli military administration in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> said the school year would end on July 21, with final exams likely to begin Saturday. Palestinian students said the step would chop a month off the school year and give them no time to study for their exams. They said the school year had been scheduled to end in mid-August. But the military spokesman, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafovitz </PERSON>, said the dates in August had only been tentative. He said the measure was not political but `` a purely technical decision.'' At the height of the Arab uprising in February, the army closed 800 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools, claiming they were major centers of Palestinian unrest. The schools were reopened in a three-stage procedure ending June 6. Since the reopening, the military administration ordered several dozen schools closed until the end of the school year. It also kept 280,000 Palestinian students in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> out of school for a week after student riots. Arab students said the new measure meant they would fail their exams. `` There is no time to study. If we go for exams, nobody would pass,'' said <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismaeel </PERSON>, 18, of <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are trying to pressure us and it's clear they are after our failure.'' A curfew on <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the largest <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city with 120,000 Arab residents, entered its fourth day Friday. Curfews also continued in the town of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, the vilage of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahur </LOCATION> and the Aida refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, and two other <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> villages. In <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahur </LOCATION>, villagers have been confined to their homes for eight days. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief official said prolonged curfews in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> have caused financial shortages. He cited a 15-day curfew imposed last month on the Bureij camp after its Arab municipality resigned in response to threats from leaders of the 7-month-old Arab uprising. Since the uprising began in December, 222 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed. The official also blamed a six-week ban on Gazans leaving for work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Arab-ordered commercial strikes for the economic difficulties. The official said the army was letting <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief trucks deliver basic food supplies to the camps, and said there was no real food shortage. `` What you've got is shortages of money,'' he said. The Israeli daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>, however, quoted an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reserve trooper Friday as saying: `` In the past few days I have given out watermelons, cantaloupes and some even come and beg me for bread.

 Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> ceremoniously snipped a ribbon Friday to open the last 36-mile link of interstate highway system in his state, but businesses on a competing road say the new route spells disaster for them. After two decades of delay, the completed stretch of Interstate 64 between <ORGANIZATION> Sam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION> creates 1,125 miles of continuous four-lane travel from <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The new road should shave an hour off the travel time between <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sulphur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, in the southeastern part of the state, reducing the trip to 1 -LCB- hours. At the opening ceremony, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> called the $ 313.5 million link a `` monument to progress.'' But for businesses along a 190-stretch of two-lane <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 60, which has been southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s lifeline for decades, I-64 can only mean a drastic drop in travelers. `` I think it'll be really disastrous,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who works at <LOCATION> Pioneer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> Country Store in <LOCATION> Chimney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corner </LOCATION>, 45 miles east of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` Given a choice, I do n't think anyone will drive -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- 60,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` You can be there for days.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 60 snakes over and around steep mountains, and the narrow lanes are crowded by coal-truck convoys that often slow traffic to 15 or 20 mph. The 2 -LCB- - hour trip from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Lewisburg </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> border is `` white-knuckle driving,'' state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highways </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said The state expects a sharp decline in attendance at Hawks Nest and <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> state parks, along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 60. `` I'm convinced that there will be an impact, and that it will not be a positive one,'' said state Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trocin </PERSON>. But officials are hoping that the drop in visitors to the parks will be more than offset by the expected boost I-64 will have in the tourism economy of the depressed southern counties, now heavily dependent on coal. They estimate that I-64 will increase the number of travelers on the interstate system in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> by 20 to 40 percent. `` We will see an influx of commercial building and development that has n't been available to us before,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Beckley-Raleigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON>. As originally planned, I-64 would have run along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 60's route In the mid-1960s, however, the route was changed to protect wetlands and to shorten the road, causing years of construction delays. Instead of running directly from <LOCATION> Lewisburg </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, it now runs to <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION>, 51 miles south of the capital. Friday's dedication took place on the east end of the $ 29 million <LOCATION> Glade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> on a platform festooned with red, white and blue balloons. Joining <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> were former Govs. <PERSON> Hulett </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Okey </PERSON> <PERSON> Patteson </PERSON> and the state's two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators and four congressmen. The Department of Highways estimated the turnout at 10,000 but <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> put the figure at 50,000. Traffic was backed up for several miles in the broiling sun as motorists and spectators waited for the dignitaries to snip the ribbon and open the road to traffic.

<HEAD>U.S. Experts Enter Battle Over Disputed Dam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts for help in a controversial, multi-billion dollar hydroelectric dam project on the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> <LOCATION> river </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. The news agency said the government is consulting San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> about the dam's operation and the likely environmental consequences of its construction. The Gabcikovo-Nagymaros dam on the Hungarian-Czechoslovak border has pitted the communist government against environmentalists who say the project and its 140-mile rerouting of the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> will flood fertile farmland and destroy natural forests and wildlife. Hungarian and Austrian environmentalists oppose the project. Czechoslovak scientists also questioned the environmental consequences of the project. Construction began in early 1980s and a completion date has been pushed back several times. Government officials hope to complete the project by 1990. Seventy percent of the construction work in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will be carried out by Austrian companies in exchange for 15 years of electricity for <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> from the finished project. The new openness evident in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s state-run media and politics in the past six weeks prompted unprecedented public coverage of environmentalists' complaints about the planned dam and raised questions about halting construction. Similar vast projects in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were halted in the past two years as Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of increased openness brought more attention to environmental questions and catastrophes. In June, parliamentarian <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiraly </PERSON> proposed that work on the project be suspended while a team of foreign experts evaluated its economic efficiency. His proposal for suspension was rejected, but word that the government plans to consult <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> indicated it is now willing to bring in foreign experts. The government is to report to the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on the project in the fall. Officials maintain that stopping construction would cost about $ 1.1 billion in payments to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and Hungarian companies for breach of contract. Officials estimate the cost of completing the dam at $ 1.08 billion. Environmentalists contend inflation will push costs to $ 2.6 billion. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Ervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsuffa </PERSON>, deputy minister of environment and water management, as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> study should examine environmental aspects of the project so that water and energy management could be adjusted accordingly.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today dismissed as unnecessary <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s proposal for former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to act as a mediator between their two campaigns `` We do n't need mediators,'' the nominee-to-be said in an interview in the governor's office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> talked eariler today, but he refused to discuss the substance of the conversation. Asked if he expected <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s name to be offered to the convention for the vice presidential nomination, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he did n't know. In <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declined to discuss the phone call except in general terms. `` Clearly, the governor understands the steps that are now necessary for unity and partnership to be achieved,'' he said. Asked if he would allow his name to be put into nomination Thursday night for vice president, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied: `` That's really a moot question.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' rejection of the mediation proposal came after <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> dismissed the idea and aides to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also expressed doubts about it. As <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> today on the second day of his bus trip to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and next week's national convention, his convention manager <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the tension between the campaigns `` is n't a question of personal pique or personal relationships.'' `` It's a question of equity. It's a question of partnership,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> insisted Thursday he has a good relationship with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, even as his remaining rival asked <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to help resolve `` the creative tensions'' between them. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> disagreed with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I do n't think, in my view, that the fact that there has been some miscommunication at this point requires the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to come to the table,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> and his counterpart, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> ... ought to come to the table within the next several hours, talk over the issues, get the platform discussions back on track and be ready for a real celebration of unity here as we prepare for the fall campaign.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that any role for <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was `` not clear yet. Frankly, we've come to no conclusion on that.'' <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser and former <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> official, said in an interview, `` I'm not sure it's necessary. ... <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> can deal with whatever they have to deal with.'' However, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> also said some involvement by <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> could help <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s followers. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter, said it was <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> who came up with the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> idea, but <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> declined to confirm that. He was budget director for <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in the White House. `` We will exercise all of our rights,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> before joining a seven-bus motorcade. `` It is an open convention. ... We are prepared to deliberate and debate, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> remained indignant over the handling of the selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s running mate. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Boston-Austin </ORGANIZATION> connection leaves <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> out of the equation,'' he said. But he also spoke of reconciliation. `` We hope in the next three or four days that matters will be resolved,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> news conference. He added that he expected a meeting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at `` some appropriate time.'' Meanwhile, a new state poll suggested the choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had helped the Democratic ticket in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, adopted home state of Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took advantage of his status as vice president, going to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to defend <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions surrounding the downing of an Iranian airliner. `` I will not dignify with a response the charge that we deliberately destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> 655,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` The foreign minister of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> knows better. He knows that this tragedy was an accident.'' It was to be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s last public appearance for a week, as he is scheduled to leave for a six-day fishing trip on Saturday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent the night in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, and his bus caravan was taking him today to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spending today focusing on state government business in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor avoided public questioning on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but repeated in a CBS News interview that he had apologized to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for failing to reach him before news of the choice of <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as his running mate. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> and I have had a good relations over the past couple of months and that's going to continue,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Asked if he expects that television viewers will see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the podium for a unity picture on the last night of the convention next week, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was optimistic: `` I expect that you will.'' Campaign aides said efforts were under way to arrange a meeting between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Sunday, the day <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is scheduled to arrive. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s bus trip is slated to wrap up Saturday afternoon with a big <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> rally. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> raised new possibilities as he began his bus trip, revealing that he had called <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> early Thursday morning to ask him to mediate. A new <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll nationally gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> about a 10-point lead. The survey of 1,695 registered voters July 8-11 gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 46 percent, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 36 percent. That is a similar margin to other polls, but five points below the margin found in a June poll.

 More than 70 national and local peace and justice groups, hoping to influence political policy, began their own meeting in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Friday, three days before the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> gets under way. Organizers of the <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> plan to create a `` People's Platform'' during their three-day meeting to be sent to Democratic and Republican national convention delegates. The platform will be produced from workshops with such titles as `` Military Counseling and Equal Access to our Youth,'' `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Government and the Drug Connection,'' `` Global Struggles for Self-Determination and Basic Human Rights'' and `` Right Wing Authoritarianism and the Fascist Mentality.'' The convention is named after a black <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> woman who led a challenge to that state's all-white delegation to the 1964 Democratic convention. The convention is being held in a downtown church, across the street from the state Capitol where white supremacists are scheduled to hold a rally Sunday.

 Attorneys for white supremacists and minority activists involved in the <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> agreed in court Friday not to interfere with each other's planned activities this weekend. The settlement in <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> came in response to a complaint filed by three activist organizations _ the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renewal </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> and LEGAL, a gay rights group _ and various individuals against the city of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the white supremacist <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and three of its leaders. The complaint asked for a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction to prevent the white supremacists from `` parading with weapons, inciting to riot, intimidating, threatening, harassing or otherwise interfering'' with the rights of the plaintiffs during simultaneous activities set for Sunday in downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. As the <PERSON> Hamer </PERSON> convention wraps up in a church Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> is set to start a march directly across the street at the state Capitol. Under Friday's agreement, both parties are enjoined from entering the other's area. This limits the supremacists to the Capitol grounds and the activists to the church. The groups also are `` mutually restrained from making threats of immediate violence to each other,'' said <PERSON> Janise </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the activists' attorney.

<HEAD>Court Rules In Favor Of City In Convention Marches Dispute</HEAD>

 The city of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> won a ruling from the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Friday in its dispute with demonstrators who sought to march on a street adjacent to the Democratic National Convention site. The appeals court noted that the city had given permission for demonstrators to march within one block of the buildings housing convention activities. `` The visibility of the parade from the actual convention site is not significantly diminished'' by holding it a block away, the court said. Alternative'88, a coalition of protest groups planning to demonstrate during next week's convention, had filed suit after the city refused to allow parades on a section of <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> next to the Omni Hotel and the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> World Congress Center. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Orinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> ruled last week that the city has a `` significant'' government interest in guaranteeing delegates' access to the convention and therefore was justified in barring parades on the street from Monday through Thursday.

In one incident, Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShields </PERSON>, a drummer in the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> band, engaged in a shouting match in front of the studio audience. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s attorneys contacted the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' attorney, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON>, to ask the couple `` if they were going to deliberately test me to see what I would do.'' But <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think that's fair, I do n't think it's right'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> to have to stay away from the ministry they created. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s visit to the studio on Thursday was without incident, said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> security chief <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ervin </PERSON>. He said she quietly watched the show and left before it ended. `` Everything was nice and calm,'' he said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he wished <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> had contacted him about the matter directly instead of going through attorneys. `` I think if Mr. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> wants to say that he should have the courtesy to call me or write a letter telling me so,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` I'll be glad to notify them. If they want to provide security, that's fine.''

<HEAD>May Trade Deficit Second Lowest in Nearly Three Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recorded a $ 10.9 billion trade deficit in May, the second smallest imbalance in almost three years, the government said Friday in a report that sent the dollar soaring on foreign currency markets. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and private economists were in agreement that the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report offered conclusive proof that the government's efforts to deal with one of the country's biggest economic problems, a seemingly intractable trade imbalance, were beginning to show results. The May deficit was actually $ 627 million higher than a revised April imbalance of $ 10.3 billion. But the April figure was the smallest imbalance since a $ 9.9 billion deficit in August 1985 and the May deficit was the second smallest imbalance since that time. Financial markets, which had been braced for a higher deficit figure, rallied on the news. The dollar jumped sharply on foreign exchange markets, rising by almost one cent against the British pound and nearly one Japanese yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> noted that for the first five months of this year, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> exports have surged by 31 percent compared with the same period in 1987, reflecting the boom conditions in American manufacturing brought on by the weaker dollar. `` The merchandise trade figures for May are consistent with the trend toward a lower trade deficit,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The improvement in the trade balance in the first five months has been widespread geographically.'' The administration launched an effort three years ago with major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to devalue the dollar as a way of making <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods more competitive on overseas markets. But the strategy took much longer than expected to bear fruit, with continued huge deficits fueling protectionist fires in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Last year, the trade deficit soared to an all-time high of $ 170.3 billion. For the first five months of this year, however, the deficit is running at an annual rate of $ 140.7 billion, a $ 30 billion improvement, if it holds for the rest of the year. `` There can be no doubt that we have turned the corner in a big way on our trade deficit,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports climbed 2.3 percent in May to $ 26.6 billion, 31 percent higher than a year ago This increase helped offset a 3.4 percent rise in imports, which climbed to $ 37.6 billion. The trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports. Part of the increase in imports reflected a higher foreign oil bill, which jumped 17.7 percent to $ 3.9 billion in May. Analysts said they looked for some further modest improvements in trade for the rest of the year, with some suggesting that the deficit would dip below $ 10 billion in coming months. But <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> investment firm, said the bulk of the improvement in trade for this year has already occurred. `` Imports are n't going to be falling because domestic demand is sufficiently strong to keep that from happening,'' he said. The rise in imports in May reflected increases of $ 1.1 billion in industrial supplies and smaller rises in imports of capital goods. Imports of autos fell by $ 600 million during the month. Analysts said this provided evidence that the price increases caused by the weaker dollar were beginning to have an effect on domestic demand. The increase in exports in May reflected a $ 300 million rise in agricultural shipments, a $ 300 million advance in sales of capital goods and a $ 100 million rise in sales of American autos and parts overseas. By country, the biggest deficit, as usual, was with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an imbalance of $ 4.1 billion, down slightly from the April imbalance of $ 4.4 billion. For the first five months of the year, the Japanese trade imbalance has shrunk by 11 percent over the same period a year ago. The improvement in the deficit with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has been a much more substantial 47 percent over the same time period. For May, the deficit with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> totaled $ 1.9 billion. The deficit with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partner, was $ 1.1 billion, while the deficit with the newly industrialized nations of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> was $ 2.4 billion in May. The substantial trade improvement has been a key factor in the better-than-expected economic growth the nation has enjoyed so far this year. Boom times in manufacturing helped drop the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June. Many economists believe nearly half of the economy's growth this year will come from an improving trade performance.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected a request to reopen an investigation of the 1976 assassination in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of a Chilean dissident. The request was filed by lawyers for the family of the dissident, <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON>, and was based on new testimony in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court by a former Chilean army major who acknowledged a role in the killing. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s unanimous ruling was made Thursday night and was published Friday by <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> newspapers. <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON> family lawyers argued that the new investigation was necessary following testimony before a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> court by <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Larios </PERSON>, the army major who surrendered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities in January 1987 and admitted to being an accomplice in the killing. Letelier and an American aide, <PERSON> Ronni </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON>, were killed when a remote-control bomb blew up his car on Sept. 21, 1976, as it rounded <ORGANIZATION> Sheridan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Embassy Row. <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON>, a Socialist and former ambassador and <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister under Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, was a prominent and influential critic of the right-wing military government of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> took power in the 1973 coup that toppled <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said in its ruling that <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Larios </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> testimony `` can not be considered as better information.'' It also noted the testimony was made after a plea-bargain agreement. Plea bargaining is barred by Chilean law. In 1978, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> court indicted <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Larios </PERSON> and two other Chilean army officers, all secret police agents, in connection with the Letelier killing. The Chilean <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for the extradition of the three officers, but last year <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Larios </PERSON> slipped out of the country and surrendered to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In 1987, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration again called on <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> to hand over the other two officers, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, a former secret police chief, and a top aide, Col. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Espoinoza </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> refused.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Rise at Moderate Pace in June; Raw Food Prices

 Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June, the government said Friday, but analysts saw cause for worry in the steep, drought-induced climb in raw food prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the hot, dry weather searing much of the nation sent prices of unprocessed grain and poultry soaring by more than 20 percent last month, pushing raw food prices 4.2 percent higher than in May. It was the biggest jump since October 1985. Food prices rose a lower, but still substantial, 1.1 percent at the wholesale level, one step before retail stores. Economists said that it was only a matter of time before price bulges at earlier production stages show up on supermarket shelves. `` Food price inflation looks like it will be with us for many months to come,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The report suggests to me that we remain in the beginning stages of a potentially spiraling inflationary process with no relief in sight.'' Other analysts, however, were less pessimistic, pointing to a drop in energy prices and generally modest increases in other areas. Energy prices fell 1.6 percent, with a 7.1 percent decline in fuel oil leading the way. Gasoline and natural gas fell 2.4 percent and 1.0 percent respectively. `` That's a real break because the last few times we had droughts, we also had double-digit increases in energy prices,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a private economic consultant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Energy prices are heading down for the rest of the summer,'' he said, noting a sharp drop between mid-June and mid-July in the price of crude oil, to the lowest level in nearly two years. Subtracting the effects of volatile food and energy prices, wholesale prices rose 0.3 percent last month, the same as in May. Analysts consider this rate a better indication of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. In other economic news: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit rose slightly in May to $ 10.9 billion, up from $ 10.3 billion in April But the imbalance was still the second smallest in almost three years. Both exports and imports increased. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June, the ninth consecutive month without a Production at utilities surged 2.6 percent, primarily for air conditioning during the heat wave. _ Business inventories in May rose a moderate 0.6 percent to $ 728.4 billion, held in check by a 0.9 percent jump in sales, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Sales rose to $ 483.7 billion. June wholesale price increases pushed the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index for finished goods to 107.9, meaning that a selection of goods costing $ 100 in 1982 cost $ 107.90 last month, 40 cents more than in May This calculation is not adjusted for seasonal variations, as are other calculations in the report. If the June price rise held for 12 straight months, the inflation rate would be 4.6 percent annually, more than double the 2.2 percent rise of 1987. For the first half of 1988, prices one step short of retail rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6 percent. Excluding food and energy, wholesale costs rose at 4.0 percent rate over that period. Although overall wholesale prices rose a modest 0.3 percent in January and fell 0.2 percent in February, they've been up 0.4 percent or 0.5 percent from March through June. The Consumer Price Index, which tracks prices at the retail level and also includes services and imported goods not in the wholesale price report, has risen at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.4 percent over the first five months of the year, the same rate as for all of 1987. Consumer price figures for June will be released next week. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottman </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the worst effects of the drought may not be felt by consumers until late this year because meat prices will initially come down as farmers slaughter animals rather than pay expensive feed prices. Cattle prices, for example, fell 5.2 percent in June while hog prices were down 4.0 percent. But when the drought-related slaughtering tapers off, curtailed supply will drive up the price of meat, he said. `` It takes anywhere from 12 to 14 months to raise a calf from birth to slaughter size so it will be well into nxt year and early 1990 before meat prices can come down again,'' <PERSON> Kottman </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offered these details from its producer price report: _ At the unprocessed level, wheat was up 25.3 percent; corn, 24.3 percent; turkeys, 22.8 percent; soybeans 22.0 percent; and chickens, 22.5 percent _ At the finished-goods level, prices for eggs rose 16.0 percent; <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION>, 9.3 percent; chicken, 7.3 percent; and fresh fruit, 6.7 percent Vegetable prices dropped 5.7 percent and rice was down 2.2 percent. _ Also at the finished level, passenger car prices were up 1.0 percent; women's clothing, up 1.0 percent; home electronic equipment, down 2.2 percent; and cosmetics, down 0.6 percent The Producer Price Index measures the price of goods at three levels of production: crude or unprocessed -LRB- for example, wheat or cotton -RRB-, intermediate -LRB- flour or cloth -RRB- and finished -LRB- wholesale bread and clothing -RRB-.

 Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON>, ending three days of uncertainty, said today he will comply with a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration demand that he depart the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> made his announcement less than three hours before the 5:30 p.m. EDT State Department-imposed deadline for him to leave the country. At the same time, <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> planned to take its case against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expulsion order to the legal committee of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said that <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> ambassadors should be protected against `` arbitary treatment'' by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> serves both as ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> had chosen to stay, he would have become an illegal alien, but would have been protected by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law from summary expulsion and guaranteed a hearing. Asked why he did not defy the expulsion order, <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> said, `` We think the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration could have used this as an argument against us to continue its aggression against our people.'' <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> planned to take a 5:15 p.m. flight to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. However, his wife and seven children planned to remain in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area. She also is attached to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission and is not affected by the expulsion order. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had said earlier he expected <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> to observe comply with the expulsion order by the deadline. Asked what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would do if <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> defied the deadline, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters `` we're expecting him to leave at that hour. Beyond that hour, he is here illegally.'' `` I do n't know where he'll hide,'' the president said, indicating the government would enforce its expulsion order if necessary. `` He's illegally here beyond that period of time. We expect him to be going to the airport or to leave.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the comments during an Oval Office picture-taking session with visiting <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> and seven other Nicaraguan diplomats 72 hours to leave the country, in retaliation for the expulsion of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven colleages from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` The 72 hours is up at 5:30,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. `` As the president said yesterday, we expect him to leave. If he does n't leave, he is subject to enforcement of the laws.'' He did not say which laws he was referring to. <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> went before the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>' permanent council Thursday to make his case against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision, accusing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of violating international law by expelling him Most of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegates remained silent during the 100-minute meeting, with few willing to take a stand on either side of this latest chapter in the long-running U.S.-Nicaraguan dispute. <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> did not ask the group to take any actions on his behalf, and no resolutions were introduced. Much of the time was spent with <LOCATION> Tunnermann </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> dueling over responsibility for the continued strife in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON>, who serves as <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ambassador to both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, said the administration has no right to expel diplomats accredited to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is a sovereign decision of our states, that the host country must respect, to designate its representation before the permanent council,'' he said. <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> said a 1975 agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> gives the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the right to expel <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> envoys who behave in an undiplomatic manner. He said <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> and a Nicaraguan military attache, Major <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampson </PERSON>, had engaged in `` certain activities'' which violated their privileges of residence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The two were among eight Nicaraguans ordered home by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after the Sandinista government expelled eight American diplomats, including Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> refused to specify what the two envoys did wrong, nor has anyone else in the administration. <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> insisted that he and his colleagues had `` scrupulously'' observed diplomatic norms during their stay here. `` We have been so careful,'' he said, `` that we ca n't even be accused of not paying fines for small traffic violations.'' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> said the administration had deferred expelling <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sampson </PERSON> earlier in order to avoid giving the Nicaraguan government a pretext for ordering home <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats. He added that the expulsion of the eight Americans this week `` removed the basis for such restraint on the part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> got a limited expression of support from Mexican Ambassador <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Icaza </PERSON>, who acted as spokesman for a group of eight Latin American nations. <PERSON> Icaza </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> governments have a right to appoint their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ambassadors, but this authority is inadequately protected under the 1975 U.S.-OAS agreement. `` As a consequence,'' he said, `` it is necessary to fill this legal vacuum.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said it expected <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> and his colleagues to comply with the expulsion order but the envoy was noncommittal Thursday when asked by reporters about his plans. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> would have a `` big surprise'' awaiting him if he decided to ignore the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand, but the threat was not spelled out.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> headed south today looking for conciliation with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as top Democrats questioned whether President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was needed to mediate tensions between the two camps. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who called on <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to help ease the rift, insisted Thursday `` we have every reason to seek a bridge'' spanning differences between him and the nominee-to-be. `` We hope that in the next three or four days that matters will be resolved'' with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` No doubt _ we're not going to give up on communications. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in the second day of his three-day bus trek to next week's convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, has expressed irritation over his perceived snub during the selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for the No. 2 spot. But he sent conciliatory signals, stressing ways to rebuild relations with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. First, he said he had spoken with former president <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> about serving as a go-between. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has not said publicly whether he will play any such role. Later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> suggested that top policy-makers from the two campaigns should talk. `` The chief policy advisers of both camps have not met,'' he said. `` Maybe they could be a bridge in the process. We have every reason to seek a bridge.'' In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dismissed the idea. `` We do n't need mediators,'' he said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, the party chairman, said today he sees no need for <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to be called in to mediate. Instead, he said on `` CBS This Morning,'' top advisers to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` ought to come to the table within the next several hours, talk over the issues, get the platform discussions back on track and be ready for a real celebration.'' <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser and former <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> official, said in an interview, `` I'm not sure it's necessary. ... <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> can deal with whatever they have to deal with.'' However, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> also said some involvement by <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> could help <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s followers. On the same program, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention manager, said no one should doubt that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will support the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. `` The question is what -LRB- is -RRB- the level and intensity of the support of his constituents going to be, and that is going to be dependent upon <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the message of the party, the direction of the party,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. At a news conference on his arrival in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was asked if there was reason for optimism that platform and other differences with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could be worked out and he said `` I certainly hope so. `` At some appropriate time _ together _ we will meet. No doubt,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declined to be specific about what he would seek in return for his help in turning out black voters, but said his session with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should be `` a meeting of substance.'' He also left open the possiblity that his forces will put his name into nomination for vice president. `` We have not yet made a decision about all the strategies we'll employ,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said today that `` the campaign has no present plans to put <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s name up for vice president.'' The bus caravan, aimed at bringing back memories of the civil rights era, was also headed for <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> before arriving in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Saturday. The caravan had been billed as a sort of rolling juggernaut building steam as it headed South, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent most of Thursday closeted in his bus or meeting with advisers. Most of the passengers were reporters rather than <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backers. There were at least 110 in the press entourage while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters numbered between 30 and 35. `` We're not picking up passengers, we're registering,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Because of travel time, we're not encouraging additional passengers.'' At a jammed church here Thursday night, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> returned to his fiery speaking style, but focused on efforts to register new voters for the fall fight against the likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We're getting ready to send <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> back into private life,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We're picking up registrations all the way down the line.''

 Ten commercial fishermen, plus 21 fish dealers, markets and restaurants were charged Friday in a sting in which an undercover game warden was able to buy and sell illegally caught redfish. More than 1,600 of the popular but endangered fish, weighing a total of more than 8,000 pounds, were illegally bought and sold, said officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` This may be a greater crime than the theft of money or goods, because when redfish are gone, they can never be replaced,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, supervisor of coastal law enforcement for the department. `` Every redfish illegally taken from the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coastal waters is something stolen from every Texan, not only today but for future generations.'' Commercial fishing for redfish has been illegal in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> since 1981. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was the first state to protect redfish, but now states from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> have passed laws to protect the species from over-harvesting, officials said. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> prohibited taking of redfish from federal water, leaving the northern coast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border to <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> as the only place redfish can be taken commercially, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottom </PERSON> of the wildlife department. All the illegally caught redfish, plus some spotted sea trout, were caught in the <LOCATION> Seadrift </LOCATION> area on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> coast. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said it took about a year for the game warden to establish himself as a fish dealer. The actual sting operation ran for about two months, beginning in April. `` It's going to be continuing. We're going to start another one,'' he said. `` We certainly hope they're a little more careful and hope they abide by the regulations,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` The message today to all who illegally sell or buy redfish is that we take that responsibility -LRB- to protect the fish -RRB- very seriously.'' The game warden bought fish from fishermen, then called or visited buyers. All transactions were conducted without any of the documentation required to sell redfish imported from other states or countries, and both sellers and buyers knew it, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. The problem of illegal fishing is widespread, he said. `` This involved 10 fishermen in one small area. There's many small fishing villages like that on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast. It could be massive,'' he said. The charges filed in the case were various grades of misdemeanors carrying penalties that include substantial fines and up to a year in jail. In addition, some violators could be assessed civil penalties with a charge for each fish bought illegally. Restitution costs could top $ 160,000, officials said.

 The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigns already had smoothed out most of their differences on the Democratic platform before the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> side called a halt to the formal negotiations, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention manager said Friday. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> broke off the negotiations Wednesday, the platform was `` close to completed. We had dealt with most of the issues.'' If the talks resume, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, `` we'd be close to signing off on it.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, sources on the <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigns had been seeking a compromise on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that would speak of human rights for all under the Camp David Accords, and make a specific reference to the Palestinians. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> platform representatives rejected out of hand last month in <PERSON> Denver </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for self-determination for the Palestinians. The sources, who asked not to be identified, said it was likely that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces would accept a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> minority plank on child care and family issues, while voting down <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for higher taxes and a military freeze. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has reserved the right to take as many as 13 issues to the floor for votes Tuesday when the convention takes up the platform. But his negotiators said from the outset it was unlikely they would pursue them all. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that most of the work that remains to be done on the platform deals with the format and how it will be presented to the convention. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he is in touch with <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign manager and chairman, but they were discussing the larger questions of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role in the fall campaign, not the specific platform and convention matters. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, the chief platform negotiators for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigns respectively, left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Four years ago in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the Democrats rebuffed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by lopsided votes on three minority planks _ a call for a policy of `` no first use'' of nuclear weapons, `` substantial'' cuts in defense spending, and elimination of runoff primaries _ while accepting a compromise <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> proposal on affirmative action. That convention also adopted <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s call for limits on use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces overseas. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has nearly 1,150 delegates going to the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention, three times as many as he had in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production, boosted by heavy demand for electricity during the summer heat wave, climbed 0.4 percent in June, the ninth consecutive month without a decline, the government said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the June advance followed identical gains of 0.5 percent in both April and May and left output 5.8 percent higher than it was a year ago. Analysts said the continued improvement showed that American manufacturers were still benefiting from an export boom, which has helped push the nation's jobless rate down to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent while giving the country the smallest trade deficits it has seen in almost three years. `` Manufacturing remains the healthiest sector of the economy,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We continue to move ahead with an economy driven by the industrial side.'' But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the June advance reflected in large part a big 2.6 percent rise in the output at the nation's utilities. Manufacturing showed a much smaller 0.2 percent rise in output. `` We are looking for the increases in industrial production to slow in coming months,'' he said, reflecting an overhang of inventories at the consumer level that needs to be worked down. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said in testimony earlier this week that the central bank was also looking for industrial output to slow. He said this would be considered a good sign that inflationary pressures were easing. The 0.2 percent rise in manufacturing reflected a 0.3 percent increase for factories making durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, and a smaller 0.1 percent rise in production of non-durable goods. While production of chemical products increased, the non-durable sector was held back by declines in the output of textiles and paper. Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 7.5 million units in June, unchanged from May. Production of light trucks, while still at a high level, edged down slightly last month. Production of business equipment showed continued strength, with a gain of 0.5 percent pushing output in this sector 9.1 percent above a year ago. The increase last month reflected solid gains in all major components except construction, mining and farm equipment, the report said. Output in the mining industry, a category that includes oil and gas drilling, rose 0.6 percent in June, partially reversing a 1.4 percent drop in May. The various changes left industrial production at a seasonally adjusted 136.6 percent of its 1977 base of 100.

 Rolling South aboard his `` Rainbow Express'' bus caravan, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke again with certain Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Friday, agreeing to a meeting of top staffers from the two camps and talking accommodation instead of discord. `` We simply can not win without each other,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a news conference along the route to the Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` We can only win with each other. It is in our distinct advantage to find common ground.'' In addition, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued to reach out to other top Democrats, this time talking with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. He did n't say what they discussed. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> just prior to a noon rally, and both agreed that their top policy advisers should meet in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Saturday night to discuss differences over Democratic policies. `` It does not signal yet the resumption of negotiations,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, but added: `` Given the creative tension in the past few days, taking a diplomative initiative to get more people involved is the right thing to do,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- agreed it's the right thing to do.'' In preparation for the meeting, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scheduled a gathering of his aides in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> Friday night. He said the two have no `` acrimony and hostility'' and have only policy matters to resolve. `` I see the tension we're going through as normal and healthy,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made it clear his role should be significant. `` People have asked repeatedly what do we expect,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` It is not mysterious. We want a commitment in the platform and by the nominee to new priorities, and to peace. `` We seek partnership and shared responsibility in a plan to win in the fall,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We seek a seat at the table in a plan to govern in the spring.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declined to say whether a personal meeting between himself and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been scheduled, repeating only that they `` no doubt will meet at some time.'' `` We obviously have a common interest in a successful convention,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made it clear that conservative forces have had their day with the selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to the No. 2 spot, and it's the liberals turn. `` All of the talks about conservative Democrats,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` They lost in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> on Super Tuesday.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> battled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the presidential nomination for months, then lobbied for the vice presidential nomination. He was then miffed at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' failure to tell him in advance of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s selection The caravan, leaving ripples of attention as it moved South, included seven buses and an equal number of cars. Inside were about 120 reporters and photographers, 30 or so supporters and about a dozen delegates, staffers said. They arrived in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> at mid-day for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to have lunch at an inner-city church. Construction workers stared curiously at the buses festooned with banners and posters, and knots of people gathered each time the motorcade swept into a city. At rallies along the way, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> focused on mobilizing his supporters, though the convention is sure to nominate <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for vice president. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s was the first bus in the caravan, equipped with a kitchen. He was accompanied by his children and advisers. Wife, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, was helping prepare for his arrival. `` She was wise enough to fly to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We're not picking up passengers; we're registering,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Because of travel time, we're not encouraging additional passengers.'' In the midst of a tense, week-long focus on relations between the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camps, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took time to lob some fire at the Republicans and their expected nominee, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We survived <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, we can survive anything,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We're getting ready to send <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> back into private life.''

 Business inventories climbed in May for the 17th consecutive month, the government said Friday, but sales also rose strongly, easing economists' worries that too many goods are accumulating on shelves and back lots. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said inventories rose 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 728.4 billion, while sales rose 0.9 percent to $ 483.7 billion. The May gain in inventories followed a 0.5 percent climb in April and was the strongest since a 0.7 percent increase in January. The jump in business sales came after a month of no change in April and a steep increase of 1.9 percent in March. Economists generally take a combination of rising inventories and falling sales as a sign of future production cutbacks. However, because sales rose srongly in May, the jump in inventories is less troublesome. `` Although there is inventory accumulation occurring now, it is in line with the fact that sales and production are increasing,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. `` If sales were to drop off, then there would be reasons for concern, but that's not the situation we're in now.'' Inventories in May were 7.5 percent higher than a year ago, while sales were 7.8 percent higher. The May inventory buildup was boosted by a 0.8 percent climb at the retail level, where sales were weakest, a 0.7 percent increase at factories and a 0.3 percent increase at the wholesale level. The strength in business sales was paced by a 1.4 percent increase at manufacturing plants. Wholesale sales climbed 0.6 percent, while retail sales edged up only 0.3 percent. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, an economic forecaster in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said most of the retail inventory overhang occurred because of weak auto sales in May. `` Excluding cars, retail inventories were up only 0.2 percent. ... June car sales rebounded very strongly which means car inventories could be coming down,'' he said. An advance estimate of retail sales in June, released Thursday, showed a 0.5 percent rise, bolstered by a strong 1.2 percent rise in automotive buying. The combination of strongly rising sales and moderately rising inventories held the inventory-to-sales ratio steady at 1.51 percent in May, the same as April. That means it would take 1.51 months to exhaust inventories at the April sales pace, a ratio not considered abnormally high.

<HEAD>Rape Victim Sues City Over 911</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who was raped in her home after police responding to a 911 call searched outside, found nothing and left sued the city Friday, blaming the attack on an inadequate telephone emergency system. The rape Feb. 2 resulted in a shakeup of emergency procedures by the city and the reprimand of five officers and three 911 employees. The suit, filed in state court by the woman and her husband, seeks unspecified damages. The couple charged that the city failed to screen and train 911 employees adequately and failed to correct procedures `` so deficient that the continued maintenance of them was outrageous and shocking to the conscience.'' City Public Safety Director <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> and Solicitor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellegrini </PERSON> declined comment Friday. The woman told police she dialed 911 about 11:15 p.m. after hearing someone trying to break in to her second-story apartment. While she was talking to the 911 operator, a man with a knife burst in and tore the telephone cord from the wall, authorities said. The 911 operator thought the woman had hung up, officials said earlier this year. When the intruder saw police walking around the house and heard them knocking on her door, he threatened the woman and told her he had `` nothing further to lose and that he might as well rape'' her, the woman said. Police searched outside for several minutes and left. They did n't break down the door because 911 operators failed to tell them that the woman reported the break-in herself and that the call broke off, authorities said. No arrests have been made in the attack. Cannon ordered 911 operators to pass on detailed information about emergency calls and to question police about how they resolve calls before the officers are permitted to leave the scene.

 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is using its oil wealth to acquire a multibillion-dollar arsenal of arms that is soaring beyond self-defense needs, worrying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and putting <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in a position to surpass the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the principal supplier to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> country. Even the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, usually sympathetic to the Saudis' pursuit of a modern military force, is showing some concern because the new air force <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is providing and missiles from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are not subject to the kind of constraints <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would have insisted on The main rationale for the purchase of jet fighter planes, helicopters and mine-hunting ships from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and intermediate-range missiles from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is to counter <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which follows a muscular Moslem course at odds with the zealous but conservative <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> royal dynasty. But ironically, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which is fighting <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an eight-year war with financial help from the Saudis, may pose a longer-range threat to the kingdom, in the view of some analysts. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has worked hard in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to clear <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons for the Saudis. The drive succeeded in 1981 when AWACS radar planes were approved after a bitter fight and failed in 1985 when the purchase of 40 F-15 fighters was shelved under congressional attack as a potential threat to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But when the Saudi missile sale from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> surfaced this year, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> grumbled about the Saudis' unwillingness to permit inspection of the rockets. The Chinese and the Saudis offered assurances the missiles would not be made capable of carrying nuclear warheads, and <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> signed the international treaty against nuclear proliferation, which provides for inspection. When the Saudis struck a $ 17 billion deal with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> this month for about 50 Tornado jet fighters, up to 60 Hawk jet trainer aircraft, more than 60 <ORGANIZATION> Westland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawk </ORGANIZATION> helicopters and six minesweeping vessels, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> argued that the weapons purchase _ one of the largest in history _ was not in the interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We think our interests are better served when we can sell legitimate self-defense items to friendly Arab countries, when we can consult with them, when we can put the regulations, the restrictions on them that prevent threats to other countries,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. At the same time, the department has consistently rejected any suggestion that the Saudis might turn their arsenal against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The oil-rich state contributed money and at least token units in wars ainst the Jewish state and supported the Palestinian uprising on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> constraints deny the Saudis some of the sophisticated equipment that could make the weapons a bigger threat against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Also, the Saudis are sometimes barred from placing their weapons within easy striking distance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The British apparently imposed no restrictions on the range or location of the weapons they are selling to the Saudis. The deal is a follow-up to a $ 9 billion British sale in 1985 and means <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will overtake the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the principal Saudi supplier. At the same time, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> still maintains an arms embargo imposed against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. Israeli officials have denounced the deal as regrettable, cynical and potentially threatening since the Saudis would be under `` tremendous pressure'' to throw the weapons into the mix in the event of another <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordesman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> scholar who advises Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., on national security affairs, says the Saudi buildup implements a strategy devised a few years ago with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to construct an effective air force as a deterrent to attack from either <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> <PERSON> Cordesman </PERSON> said the Saudis are buying billions of dollars of arms not to threaten <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, although the lack of constraints on the British arms poses a potential problem. `` I do n't think they are on a binge,'' he said. `` I think they very consistently have pursued the idea the only hope of having an effective deterrent is to have an effective air force,'' he said. From a strategic standpoint, <PERSON> Cordesman </PERSON> saw the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in a continuing `` partnership'' despite the purchases from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Only <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can project the kind of power in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> that would protect the Saudis in a major crisis, while the Saudis would provide bases and other help to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in wartime, he said. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carus </PERSON>, an adjunct scholar at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Institute </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Policy </LOCATION>, traces the buildup to the royal family's ties with the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> defense establishment and riots last year in the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. `` The Saudis consider themselves the guardians of the holy places,'' <PERSON> Carus </PERSON> said. `` The Iranians were saying, ` You do n't have that right.' For the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> that was a declaration of war. The Saudis found a real enemy.'' <PERSON> Shai </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, senior research associate at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> face a potential threat from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the current <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war and from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> once the war ends. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has built its army up to 28 to 30 divisions in the war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and the weaker gulf states `` are going to worry about the implications,'' he said. Adding British Tornados to the air force means the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> will have a jet fighter capable of low-level penetration, one that is `` more offense-oriented than others,'' <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. `` That's the real reason some Israelis are worried,'' he said.

<HEAD>Husband Can't Sue Wife's Lover over Children</HEAD>

 A husband ca n't sue his wife's lover for the emotional distress he suffered when he learned the lover had fathered her children, a state appeals court ruled. Courts should stay out of such affairs, it said Thursday. `` The innocent children here may suffer significant harm from having their family involved in litigation such as this,'' the 1st <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> said in ordering the suit dismissed on `` public policy'' grounds. The court said, however, that a husband in such a situation might be able to sue for reimbursement of money he spent to support the children after being falsely told he was the father. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> case involved a divorced couple, identified by the court as <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON>, and her lover, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> During </PERSON> the affair, the court said, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> gave birth to a daughter in 1983 and to a son in 1984. She sued for separation from <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> in 1985, saying at the time that the children were his. But in a settlement of the divorce case in January 1987, all parties agreed that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> was the father. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> sued <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> the next month, claiming fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and sought $ 1.75 million in punitive damages. The suit said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> knew shortly after the births that he was the father of both children, but misled <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> into thinking he was the father, congratulating him and agreeing to be the daughter's godfather It was only after the children were one and two years old, and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> and his parents had become emotionally attached to them, that he was told the truth, he said. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> refused to dismiss the suit but was overruled by the appeals court on a 3-0 vote. While fraud and infliction of emotional distress normally are grounds for a damage suit, the subject of this suit `` is not one in which it is appropriate for the courts to intervene,'' said the opinion by Justice <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. He distinguished the case from suits that have been allowed for deceit when a woman was infected with venereal disease that her lover had concealed, or when a woman suffered an abnormal pregnancy and needed a life-saving operation after her lover told her he was sterile. Both of those cases involved physical injuries and neither had a potential for harming innocent children, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He also said allowing the suit would conflict with the public policy of encouraging natural fathers to acknowledge and support their children. `` Men in <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>'s situation, who are otherwise willing to voluntarily acknowledge and support their children, would have a strong disincentive to do so since revealing the truth would subject them to this type of tort action,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> ATLANTA </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- - <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, who lost the presidential race four years ago after a divided convention, said Friday Democrats must avoid allowing tensions between <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from going so far they `` set poison down into the roots'' and spoil chances for the ticket in the fall. The former vice president, who is staying out of the spotlight while Democrats hold their convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> beginning Monday, said he hopes <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will join in fully supporting the eventual Democratic ticket with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> _ and believes he will despite tensions now. `` It is traditional, almost to be expected, that we'll have some struggles _ but it is how those struggles are conducted and whether they'll stay within the lines that allow the nominee to come out of the convention with a feeling in the public that he's ready to president,'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said. `` I think Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> knows that,'' he said. `` We always have rising tensions about this time; it's inherent. ... But I believe this is a year where Democrats understand these fights, if they're carried on too far, become too personalized, they set poison down into the roots that can be difficult to deal with.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, in an interview with news agency reporters, also said he believes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' failure to reach <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by telephone to inform him of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s selection as vice president was not an intentional slight. He said it should not be allowed to become the basis of crippling divisions. `` It was n't intentional,'' he said, noting that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tried to call and was unsuccessful. `` It would have been far better if the call had been completed in time, but those things happen, with the best of intentions.'' The former party standard bearer _ loser in a landslide to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984 _ said he was not disappointed that he was not on the program to address the convention. `` No, the point here is to get <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> elected, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> elected _ it's not to revive 1984 or any of those other things,'' he said. `` I would play it exactly the way <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> is playing it. He's got to be here on his own.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> appeared at the start of a daylong conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where Democrats and political observers held seminars on the 1988 election, and the American political system, for 300 political and government leaders from foreign countries. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention manager and top adviser, offered a frank acknowledgement that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would not be the Democratic nominee while saying he would still have his name placed in nomination for president. `` Although we've all concluded, as I do, that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be the nominee of the party, there will actually be two names to go to the floor of the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night, and those two names are <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. He described <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign as altering the political landscape forever, making race `` much less a factor in American politics today.'' Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> spoke to the group at a luncheon where he praised <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> for having `` orchestrated ... what will be one of the most successful conventions that we've ever seen, certainly in my political lifetime.''

 Republican leaders set up shop Friday to snipe at the Democrats during their convention next week, and immediately began talking about the policy differences between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Senate Minority leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., said that regardless of whom Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picks as his vice presidential candidate, `` you're going to find only shades of difference in our philosophy, not this chasm you find between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the one hand and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on the other. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> have opposing views on subjects ranging from Contra aid and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> economic program to key defense issues such as the MX missile, the Strategic Defense Initiative and the B1 bomber. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he does n't want <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to be a mere clone. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., held a news conference at a downtown hotel to announce the opening of a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> media center, making <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders available to reporters `` when they need a quote, an opinion or a different perspective to round out a story. The operation will run each day of the Democratic convention next Monday through Thursday. The planned speakers includes members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, governors, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and others. `` We are not here to be negative,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> insisted. `` We are here to be comparative.'' Calling the presidential election a crossroads for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` We can build on the stable, record-setting economic pace of the Reagan-Bush years, we can continue to pursue peace through strength, or we can head down a road already traveled,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Do we want to go back to 1980? Do we want a reunion with double-digit inflation, sky-high interest rates, massive unemployment and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> held hostage overseas? I do n't think so,'' the senator said. `` We Republicans have listened to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the last thing the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want is a radical, wrenching 180-degree change in direction,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> added. The news conference also highlighted differences among Republicans when the two politicians were asked whether they think President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should sign a bill _ which the administration strongly opposes _ requiring advance notice to workers of plant closings. Ms. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said she opposes the bill, but <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said that if he were president, he might let it become law without his signature because a veto probably would be overridden. Polls show that a majority of Americans support the bill, and <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> plan to make it a campaign issue if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoes it. `` In a way, you'd like it to go away cause it's not an easy issue to explain,'' Rep. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> commented. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also took the opportunity to advertise his availability as a possible running mate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. While decrying the differences between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the Republicans did not have that problem. `` I know. I looked for sharp differences in my primary contest with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ you could n't find them, whether it was the line-item veto or balanced budget amendment or a strong defense or SDI _ they were n't there. `` You can certainly find them in looking over the comparison between my good friend <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. While running against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> complained repeatedly that the vice president had not left his mark on foreign policy issues and other matters. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also mentioned Ms. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> as a possible running mate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. She, in turn, mentioned <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, as well as the senator, as possible candidates.

 Two plaintiffs who lost a race discrimination lawsuit said Friday a federal judge's refusal to let their attorney use `` Ms.'' or her maiden name in court generated a furor that turned their trial into a sideshow. `` This was a race discrimination lawsuit. But it got lost in the shuffle. Somewhere along the line, justice was not served here,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON>, one of two plaintiffs. <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Donora </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who are black, claimed <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> fostered and condoned racial harassment at the company's automotive windshield plant in nearby <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION>. Following a three-week trial before Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON>, a jury cleared PPG. The verdict came hours after <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> apologized to <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolvovitz </PERSON>, and offered to grant a mistrial following a flurry of headlines about his threats to jail Ms. <PERSON> Wolvovitz </PERSON> for not using her husband's name <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said the apology and offer for a mistrial, which Ms. <PERSON> Wolvovitz </PERSON> turned down, was too little too late. `` I do n't know where to turn now. I want to appeal, and I want justice ... but I just do n't have the money,'' he said. `` It almost cost me 10 grand to go this far. As far as a mistrial, what am I going to do about that? The transcript alone will cost $ 6,000.'' <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON>'s behavior `` politicized that jury. He alienated the jury from us. These people perceived us and our lawyers as being radical.'' `` I thought they were on our side until this guy started performing,'' <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. `` I think the comments he made were unprofessional, and I think he prejudiced the jury by doing it.'' The judge interrupted testimony July 8 to scold Ms. <PERSON> Wolvovitz </PERSON> and threaten that she would `` sleep in the county jail'' if she refused to be called Mrs. <PERSON> Lobel </PERSON>, her husband's last name, in court. The judge found her co-counsel, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pushinsky </PERSON>, in contempt for coming to her defense. He also polled the female jurors on their preferences in courtesy titles. Ms. <PERSON> Wolvovitz </PERSON> on Monday asked for a mistrial, which the judge denied, and when she again resisted his order to change her name he asked: `` What if I call you sweetie?'' `` He started out with this ` sweetie' stuff and then it escalated,'' <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said. `` He even patted her on her head. At one point he put his hand around her waist. ... `` Even about my wife, he said, ` You have a beautiful wife, do n't you agree?''' Neither Ms. <PERSON> Wolvovitz </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Pushinski </PERSON> would confirm or deny their clients' claims. `` The record speaks for itself,'' <PERSON> Pushinski </PERSON> said. `` It's difficult to remember everything that took place in a 3 -LCB- - week trial,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wolvovitz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> was not in his office Friday and could not be reached for comment. The judge's law clerk, <PERSON> JoAnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempler </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> is often informal in court, making jokes and small talk to reduce tension. But <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said the judge's actions on July 8 went beyond that. `` The judge was screaming. He was shouting. He pointed at all these women and screamed at them ` What's your name?' When that man screamed and shouted I said ` Oh my God, what's this guy doing? He's tampering with the jury.' <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Wolvovitz </PERSON> was so shaken she sobbed while cross-examining a witness, and that he in turn began to weep. `` This man did n't apologize to <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> and me,'' he said. `` Where's the apology to us? He had me crying.''

 A federal judge has upheld <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seashore </ORGANIZATION> guidelines allowing off-road vehicles on an eight-mile stretch of beach, defeating conservationists who claim the vehicles threaten the fragile ecosystem. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> ruled that off-road vehicle driving on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>'s northern beaches `` is an appropriate public use ... and does not adversely affect the Seashore's natural, scenic and aesthetic values.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which sued over dune buggy use in 1981, appealed the decision to the 1st <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The conservationists contend that vehicles threaten shore bird nesting and the tender vegetation that stems erosion of the dunes. They also say vehicles destroy the natural beauty and interfere with other beach-goers. But <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said in a ruling signed late last month that dune nesting and beach aesthetics are unaffected by the vehicles, and that conflicts between drivers and other beach users are minimal. Under amended rules issued in 1985, vehicles are limited to the eight-mile stretch from <LOCATION> Hatches </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to High Head in <LOCATION> Truro </LOCATION>. Winter driving is prohibited and the beach is closed when tides, beach configurations or bird nesting make the route impassable. Just one of the Seashore's six public beaches, Race Point, is open to drivers, who must get a permit, have their vehicle inspected and watch a videotape on ecology. The Seashore issues about 2,000 permits a year, <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seashore </ORGANIZATION> chief ranger <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> said Friday. All dune areas are off limits except a few tracts with deeded access rights. The ruling `` reinforces the fact that we have taken the appropriate steps to meet the natural resource objectives and meet the public interest,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seashore </ORGANIZATION> chief ranger <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> said Friday. The Cape Cod National Seashore, created by the 1961 federal Seashore Act, enacted a resource management plan in August 1981 to control increasing numbers of beach-goers and wheeled vehicles. The three conservation groups sued the day the plan took effect. The original plan allowed vehicles on 12 miles of beach from April to November, and on a 25-mile stretch in <LOCATION> Eastham </LOCATION> in winter. After an order from <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, the plan was amended in 1985. `` The court is basically saying, yes, the'85 plan is a resonable plan, it addresses adequately the balance of different uses, accommodates all visitors to the Seashore and protects its resources,'' <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> said. Conservationists say off-road vehicle use is prohibited under the Seashore Act, which bans action that `` would be incompatible with the preservation of the unique flora and fauna or the physiographic conditions now prevailing.'' But the act permits recreational development _ for activities such as fishing, camping and sailing _ that is environmentally `` compatible'' and `` appropriate'' to the beach. The government can ban off-road vehicle use if found to have adverse effects on soil, vegetation or wildlife habitats. The law foundation said policing drivers is difficult, that even small incursions on tender dune grass are harmful and that the Seashore has handed over one-fifth of the beach to drivers, who comprise just 3 percent of its 6 million annual users. `` The law did not envision the rampant off-road vehicle use that has gone on since the Seashore was created,'' foundation staff scientist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauge </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> said rangers last year filed 236 reports of dune buggy violations, issuing about 100 fines of $ 50 and 100 warnings. Seashore officials said most beach drivers are fishermen needing access to the tip of Race Point. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> survey found that only a small percentage of Seashore visitors opposed vehicle use or said they were displaced by it.

 Fifteen residents of the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION>'s Home were placed in state custody when a judge found they had been subjected to abuse from a director who has said he relies on paddlings and exercise to reform. A 16th child was released to parents. Youth Court Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> ruled Thursday 11 of the children had been abused, three abused and neglected and one neglected. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s rulings were the latest action in a feud between the state and the home's founder, the Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>. Fountain claims the First Amendment and its separation of church and state shield <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> from state intervention. State Welfare Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> wants to use the case to persuade the Legislature to require the registration or licensing of religious boarding homes. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is one of five states that has no such law. The 16 children were among 72 <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> ordered removed from the home in June. That followed his decision that a 14-year-old runaway had been abused and neglected. An unknown number of residents fled when officials arrived at the home June 10. Fountain has told the media he had about 120 children at the home, most from out of state. But he has refused to comply with a court order to provide a list of their names. About 50 children have n't been accounted for. Fountain, who has said he uses licks with a switch or exercise to control and reform children, and two of his assistants are being fined $ 500 each per day for refusing to answer questions in court. Two days of hearings were held this week concerning discipline and care of the 16 children. Most of the other children already have been released to their parents or guardians. State officials contend some of the practices at the 10-year-old institution constitute abuse and that children have been medically neglected while at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. Youth Court hearings are normally closed to the news media, but <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> opened the hearings on the condition the children not be identified.

<HEAD>Teamsters Reject Presser's Heir, Name McCarthy President</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> turned Friday to one of its `` old guard'' leaders, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, to head the besieged union, narrowly rejecting the image-conscious heir designate of the late <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>. The union's 17-member General Executive Board elected <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 69, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, by a one-vote margin over Secretary-Treasurer <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> to fill out the last three years of <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s term as the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' president. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, who died a week ago, had appointed <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, 62, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, in May as acting president of the 1.6-million-member union. The appointment was to last for 120 days, and was made just before <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> underwent brain surgery for cancer. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> remains the union's secretary-treasurer in the wake of the board's decision Friday. The turnover in the top post of the nation's largest union _ one in every 75 working Americans is a Teamster _ occurs just two weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed suit to seize control of its affairs, claiming the union's leadership has been controlled by organized crime for more than 30 years. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> led a a rump movement among Teamster vice presidents against a new nationwide trucking contract, signed in May, covering some 200,000 union members. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> indicated Friday he now will try to reopen the pact. `` I do n't know what I can do but I plan to do everything I can to improve on it and get the wishes of our membership,'' he said at a news conference following his election. The contract was declared ratified, even though 64 percent of the affected members who voted opposed it. Rejection requires a two-thirds vote under the union's constitution. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who has presided over the 8,000-member Teamsters Local 25 in <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, for 33 years and headed the international union's operations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> for two decades, declined to discuss his power struggle with <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>. `` That's not the issue,'' he said. `` I got enough votes to become the president. The great strength of this board is that we will argue and fight about an issue but when the majority vote is taken, everyone stands behind the decision.'' Asked by a reporter what <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> would have thought about his election, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> confirmed his reputation for a quick temper. `` Who knows? Maybe he would roll over in his grave,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> replied. `` I do n't know what he was thinking. Why do n't you try to locate him. That's a goofy question, I'll give you a goofy answer.'' The board's exact vote was not announced, but several sources, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> won by a 9-8 count. Supporters of <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> tried several maneuvers to thwart <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s ascension, including postponing the decision until a special convention of 2,000 Teamster representatives could be assembled. But their various proposals were all rejected by the same 1-vote margin. At least two union vice presidents _ the board consists of 16 vice presidents and <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> _ objected to declaring the vote for <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> unanimous, a Teamster tradition when the mantle is passed from one president to another, one source said. `` Two years from now, you're going to start seeing people campaigning like crazy,'' he said, referring to the union's next international convention in the spring of 1991. Both <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> are viewed by leaders of other labor unions as being `` clean'' _ with no major ties to organized crime figures in contrast to the ties that the government alleges that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and former Teamster Presidents <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> had. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> was seen, in addition, as more image-oriented. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> helped <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> orchestrate several public relations campaigns in recent years, and helped open the union to women and other groups in an attempt to expand the membership base in the wake of problems generated by trucking deregulation. Like all of the Teamster vice presidents, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was named a defendant in the federal suit to take over the union. But his name surfaced only once in the 200 pages of documents the government filed two weeks ago to support its case. In a transcript of an FBI-wiretapped conversation on May 9, 1984, convicted <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> crime boss <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> is quoted as recognizing <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s name as the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' `` head boss of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, this guy.'' With the government's unprecedented attempt to take over the union, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said Friday he has a `` tough job ahead. `` It should be condolences, not congratulations.'' But he said he is confident the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> will eventually win the case when it goes to trial before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There's a lot of insinuations and allegations made,'' he said. `` But ... if the judge hears our side, I feel we will come out just as clear as we were and have been.''

<HEAD>Conference Cites Long Anti-Jewish Tradition In Christianity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A conference on the Holocaust on Friday accused <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> churches of centuries of anti-Jewish teaching, and one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expert said the tradition helps explain why <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> genocide went unchecked in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The failure of European civilization to stem the tide of evil during the Holocaust makes it critically important to counteract historical and traditional Christian anti-Jewish teaching,'' said a statement issued by the international conference. The statement concluded a weeklong gathering of 500 academics, concentration camp survivors, theologians and teachers. The conference met in the university town of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> before moving to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday. Christian churchmen, including <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hume </ORGANIZATION>, joined in prayers for the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' 6 million Jewish victims, and conference organizers read out messages from leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> received a standing ovation for a message in which he acknowledged German responsibility for the Holocaust and said: `` We Germans are prepared to live with this terrible truth.'' President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` The words ` never again' must ever be the pledge of all who pause in remembrance of those who have perished.'' A major theme of the conference was how Christians allowed the World War II slaughter of Jews to happen. Delegates focused on longtime Christian church teachings that the Jews were responsible for the murder of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and were condemned to wander without a homeland. Most churches have since stopped espousing this belief, including the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in 1965. The Rev. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Littel </PERSON>, an American Methodist minister and a leading academic expert on the Holocaust, said that despite `` an acute rise in sensitivity -LRB- by Christian churches toward Jews -RRB- in the past 25 years ... the problem remains.'' `` Why do you suppose the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> churches find it so hard to come to terms with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>?'' asked <PERSON> Littel </PERSON>, a former professor of religion at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` It is because they are used to teaching that the Jew is a loser,'' <PERSON> Littel </PERSON> said in an interview. `` They've been teaching for centuries that he is supposed to wander, supposed to be miserable.'' <PERSON> Littel </PERSON> said that in 1936, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops courageously protested the persecution of Jews. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> response was `` what are you complaining about _ we're just doing what your churches have been teaching about all along.'' The Anglican bishop of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, the Rt. Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Christians </PERSON> had to examine `` how it is that at the heart of a so-called Christian civilization, such unspeakable atrocities could be perpetrated.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> heads an Anglican committee which will submit a new policy document on the church's relations with Jews to the Lambeth Conference, an international gathering of Anglican bishops opening Monday. Several participants at the conference paid tribute to Christians who helped Jews during the Holocaust. Historian <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> noted that 24 British doctors, only one of whom was a Jew, went to treat those being liberated from <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp. Many of the prisoners were known to have typhoid and none of the doctors who volunteered had received immunizations. As a result, many of them died. The conference was sponsored by publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, 65, a Czechoslovak-born Jew who fled to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as a teen-ager, and his French Protestant wife, <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> asked delegates to stand and applaud after reading out <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s message. `` Germans became guilty of that crime -LRB- the Holocaust -RRB- as individuals, but they are collectively liable for the injustice committed in their name,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, said in his message. `` No one can rule out the possiblity of comparable atrodcities happening again,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s message added. `` It must not be forgotten.''

<HEAD>State Department Pressed To Lift Suspension of Soviet Refugees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty-three senators and nine <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members on Friday called for an immediate end to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s suspension of refugee processing, which has left thousands of prospective immigrants to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> temporarily stranded in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> The senators told President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a letter: `` This decision sends a terrible signal to those seeking freedom all over the world, and could give the Soviets the opportunity to claim that it is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and not the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> which is impeding emigration.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on refugees, asked Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> either to find the estimated $ 10 million required to resume refugee processing at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> or to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for additional funds. The suspension went into effect on July 4 and is scheduled to last until Oct. 1 It came after a sudden surge in the number of visa applications by Soviet citizens, mostly Armenians and Jews, and after the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had increased the annual number of refugees the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would accomodate. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> relaxed emigration policies recently and in June the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy issued some 2,000 refugee visas, more than the total approved for all of the 1987 fiscal year which began Oct. 1, 1986. `` In light of the promises this country has made to welcome and resettle thousands of emigres from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the suspension should be lifted immediately,'' the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in a letter. They said the suspension will result in the `` forced displacement of many families who have already lost their homes and their jobs, and who, in many cases, have made long journeys to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to begin refugee processing.'' `` After urging the Soviets to open the gate of emigration, it is important that we find this funding for refugee assistance, the letter said. `` To do otherwise could leave thousands of people in a state of uncertainty and desperation, and send a disturbing signal that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is unwilling to back up its commitment to accomodate those seeking refuge.'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who initiated the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> letter, said his attention was drawn to the situation when a couple with four children he been attempting to help leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were told the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy could not process their applications for three months. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said two members of the family of <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pepa </PERSON> <PERSON> Forkosh </PERSON> are sick and two are infants. He said they had traveled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, have been compelled to move into an expensive apartment and are rapidly using up their funds. Other signers of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> letter were Reps. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, R-Ga.; <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn.; <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>; D.

<HEAD>Baltimore Scientists Find Key Protein In Detecting Aromas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A complex protein produced in a nasal gland has been identified by researchers as the chemical messenger that carries aromas to the odor-sensing nerves of the nose. Dr. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> said Friday he and three other researchers have cloned the gene that gives instructions for the creation of the protein and may one day be able to use the protein to sharpen the sense of smell. The protein, called the odorant binding protein or OBP, is secreted by the lateral nasal gland and then carried by a duct to the tip of the nose, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. When air is inhaled, the OBP is sprayed as fine mist into the air that flows into the nose, he said. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said the protein binds with airborne molecules as they are inhaled and is then carried past a nerve bundle that picks up the chemical message of the odor. `` The nerve endings are way back, high in the nose,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Only a small portion of the nose has these receptors.'' When the OBP comes in contact with the receptors, the nerves interpret the chemistry of the OBP as a particular smell. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said the precise mechanism of how the nerves can distinguish between different smells, such as sweet and sour, is not yet understood. He said what is detected as a fragrance may actually be caused by the chemical reaction of the OBP mixed with the fragrance molecule. By cloning the gene that produces the <ORGANIZATION> OBP </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said his team should be able to produce large quantities of the protein and conduct further studies into the sense of smell, one of the least understood of the senses. Use of OBP may be of medical significance in restoring lost appetite or helping patients who have totally lost the sense of smell. `` This could help the elderly regain their appetite,'' said <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. `` As people age, they lose their sense of smell'' and this often is the reason that older people stop eating as they should. By spraying OBP into the nose, he said, it may help restore some of the sense of smell. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said much more research must be conducted before specific, clinical uses for the OBP are found. A report on the study was published Friday in Science, the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Science. Others on the OBP research team are <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pevsner </PERSON>, also of <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.

 The lingering drought has forced organizers of <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION>'s seventh annual Sweet Corn Festival to import corn for the event all the way from down <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't find anything home-grown right now; it is coming out of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, produce manager at a store in <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, who obtained the corn through a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> food terminal.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, the first black to head <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s police force, announced his retirement Friday, saying the corruption problems that rocked the department during his 3 -LCB- - year tenure are `` behind us now <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, 54, will be replaced by another black, Assistant Chief <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. A <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> policeman for almost 29 years, <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> became eligible for retirement this year and said at a news conference that he simply decided to take it. `` This was entirely my own idea,'' he said. `` I felt like the highlights of my career I had already experienced.'' <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said he was proud of overcoming challenges `` such as the corruption problems in the department. That is behind us now.'' The soft-spoken chief inherited a department that had doubled to almost 1,100 officers _ many poorly trained _ after the 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> riots and the Mariel boatlift. Under his tenure, about 100 officers were charged with crimes or punished administratively, including those convicted in the `` River Cops'' case that grew out of a deadly cocaine ripoff ring run by officers on the midnight shift. But in addition to the successful actions against rogue cops, there were lingering embarrassments, including the unsolved theft of $ 150,000 from the narcotics unit. At the news conference, <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> took pains to say that no one had forced him out. But afterward, he blasted the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, saying a three-member majority did not like him, `` and frankly I did n't like them very much.'' The city manager's quick choice of <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, who was a symbol to many in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s black community, was seen as an effort to decrease tension the chief's departure might create.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special task force headed by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> told President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday the 1988 drought and abnormal heat are the worst on record at this stage of the season, and have bitten deeply into harvests of wheat, soybeans, corn and other livestock feed grains. `` While July rains have eased the dry conditions in some parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, conditions have worsened in the eastern <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> where crops are now in the critical growth stage,'' the panel said in its second report to the president. Market prices for a number of commodities `` are well above spring levels and are highly volatile,'' the report said. Some livestock producers, faced with rising feed costs, have been forced to liquidate herds. The report mostly reviewed what has been said before by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies, and during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tour this week in drought areas of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> will head a team on a three-day visit next week to 11 drought-stricken states, from <LOCATION> Tennesee </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>. As <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had reported earlier, the report noted that 1988 wheat production is down 13 percent from last year, and that the corn crop is expected to decline by 26 percent to 5.2 billion bushels. Soybean output is also projected to drop by 13 percent. Consumer food prices, the task force reported, are expected to rise an additional 1 percent this year because of the drought, and another 2 percent in 1989. That was in line with previous <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates. The task force said drought relief legislation has been working its way through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and `` would provide effective disaster assistance if it advances unencumbered with provisions unrelated to the drought'' and meets budgetary and other guidelines.

<HEAD>Once-Disgraced Soviet Satirist Is Rehabilitated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sixteen years after he was expelled from the Soviet Writers Union for allegedly urging Jews to emigrate, <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> songwriter <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Galich </PERSON> has been posthumously reinstated, it was reported Friday. The action by the writers union amounts to a rehabilitation of the popular Jewish bard once condemned by the official press as a `` traitor'' and a drunkard with a `` pathological lust for money.'' The announcement by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency called <PERSON> Galich </PERSON> `` a talented poet, songster and playwright'' who was unjustly vilified. `` Bureaucrats responsible for culture in the 1970s closed the doors to the press and the motion pictures industry before him and then hounded him out of the country for what they considered ` seditious' writings,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Galich </PERSON>'s satire about official hypocrisy, the apathy of the Soviet masses and the labor camps that dot the nation made him unpopular with authorities. But he was a hit among the people, who listened to his songs on tapes circulated underground and read them in books published abroad. The writers union, accusing <PERSON> Galich </PERSON> of `` agitation for the emigration of Soviet Jews to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' expelled him from its ranks in January 1972. <PERSON> Galich </PERSON>, who wrote screenplays in addition to songs, was also expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>.

 Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, declaring his services as a mediator unneeded, said Friday that the relatively minor differences between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could vanish `` if the two men understood each other a little bit better.'' `` The compatability between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and their followers are so overwhelming that the differences are relatively insignicant,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at the Carter Presidential Center. `` I do n't think they need any mediation,'' he said. `` I think what is needed is to just have a better means of communication directly with one another and to get any misunderstandings resolved as early as possible in the convention.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who sought to be named <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' vice presidential candidate, seemed miffed when the pick went to Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and word got out before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> personally relayed the decison to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He said Thursday that he had asked <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to act as mediator between his and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' camps. However, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rejected that idea Friday, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides also expressed doubts about it. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said if any mediation is needed the role should go to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> but that he might get involved if <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> asked him to. However, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> also said he saw no role for a mediator. The former president said he did not see ill will over the vice presidential choice lasting much past the convention. `` That's one of the reasons for the convention, to resolve differences within the party. It is not unprecedented,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` When the Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called me ... we talked about the procedures that I always used when I was running for president or when I was in the White House. `` When I had a major decision to make ... I brought into the White House key leaders of the black community, who were also my political supporters. I asked them for advice and I listened very carefully to them. There was never any doubt that in a very genuine way they were a part of the deliberations of my government.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he thought the choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> could help <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the South against the expected Republican presidential candidate, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He described <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as `` a man who provides a philosophical balance to the ticket'' and `` who has had a lot to do with minority problems with Spanish and blacks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and I think he's well-respected in the South. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he plans no major role for himself at the convention or during the campaign. He is to address the convention Monday night. If during the campaign incorrect statements are made about events to which he was a party, or has special knowledge, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said, `` I will reserve the right to set the record straight.''

<HEAD>Mayor's Panel Recommends Razing Public Housing High-Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city should demolish most, if not all, of its 168 public housing high-rise buildings for families and find new homes for the 70,000 tenants, a report by a mayor's advisory group recommends. Contents of the report, completed in May and submitted to Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> more than a month ago have not been made public officially, but they were outlined in Friday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` The report does n't recommend tearing down any housing until adequate housing is available,'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Klutznick </PERSON>, co-chairman of the 25-member panel, said by telephone Friday. He declined to discuss the report further. A spokeswoman for the mayor said Friday that <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> planned to release details of the report by the Mayor's <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> later this month. The council's recommendation to raze family high-rises represents the strongest and most official endorsement of a politically sensitive concept that has been discussed for many years, the newspaper said. The panel's call for gradual elimination of the family high-rises is based, the newspaper said, on problems common in public housing in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and other cities _ a rapidly deteriorating housing stock, a lack of funding to make necessary repairs and the worsening of social problems that occur by crowding large numbers of poor families together. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> urban studies professor who published a 1986 book advocating replacement of high-rises, said public housing residents should be relocated throughout the metropolitan area. `` People have blinders when they think we can solve the challenge of providing safe, sanitary, decent housing in the city itself,'' said <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON>, who was not a member of the advisory panel, which was established more than a year ago by the late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. According to the council's report: `` High-rise buildings per se are not a problem. Rather, the problem ... is the intense concentration of large, poor, primarily single-parent families in buildings poorly designed to support their needs.'' `` This is further compounded by the concentration of such buildings in close proximity to each other while being racially and economically segregated and isolated from viable neighborhoods,'' the report said. Worsening conditions at the city's public housing developments are mainly due to a 76 percent drop in federal funding for housing programs nationally over the last eight years, the council said. It said the cost of replacing 800 CHA units a year would be $ 20 million to $ 48 million, but contended this would be cheaper than trying to rehabilitate many of the high-rises. Funds raised through the sale of CHA properties could be used to buy buildings or construct them, the report said. In addition, it suggested that another source of money would be federal funds now earmarked for rebuilding the high-rises.

<HEAD>GOP Makeover Of Superdome 20 Percent Complete, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republican National Convention officials said Friday their $ 15 million makeover of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superdome </ORGANIZATION> is already about 20 percent complete just five days after they took over the massive arena to prepare for next month's convention. `` We are on schedule or ahead of schedule on every phase,'' convention manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> told reporters during a guided tour of the dome. Work was being done on the framework of a huge, $ 570,000 podium from which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other dignitaries will adress the 31,000 people expected to attend the convention, which runs Aug. 15-18. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is spending about $ 9 million on the convention. The city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is raising about $ 5.5 million through private contributions to pay for the sound and light systems and other projects. `` Basically, we're looking at a $ 15 million operation,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. Best known as an indoor football stadium, the dome is looking less and less like the home of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> and more and more like a media center. Four television networks will have tall, multi-level booths near the podium. Carpenters and electricians worked to convert suites known as skyboxes, which overlook the floor from the perimeter of the stadium, into broadcast booths for other radio and television broadcasters. Arising on either side of the podium was the framework for the structures from which print journalists will observe the proceedings. Still to come is the hanging of the nine-story high, three-ton blue curtain that will serve as a room divider for the dome. Public convention business will be conducted for the cameras on one side while trailers, used as offices, will be driven onto the floor behind the curtains. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said construction should be completed by Aug. 10, giving convention officials plenty of time to run tests on equipment before the convention begins. Once the convention ends, the construction work begins again _ in reverse. The Republicans' agreement with the Superdome calls for the stadium to be restored to its original condition by Aug. 25.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Friday he does n't need a mediator to settle his pre-convention differences with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and his Democratic rival acknowleged, `` We can only win with each other.'' The two men talked by telephone and agreed to have their top aides meet in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Saturday night, as they edged away from a confrontation that threatened to disturb the peace at the party's convention `` I want him involved, I want his staff people involved,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose nomination is assured. At the same time, he curtly rejected his rival's call to have former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> mediate their disagreements. `` We do n't need mediators,'' he said in an interview in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, in an interview in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, also said his services as a mediator were unneeded. He called for better communication and suggested relatively minor differences between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could vanish `` if the two men understood each other a little bit better.'' The latest Democratic developments came as Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was ready to hang a `` gone fishing'' sign on his door in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Aides said he would spend the next several days in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who is expected to resign his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post shortly to join his old friend's campaign for the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican surrogates set up camp behind enemy lines in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and began stressing the policy differences between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his more conservative running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said that regardless of whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picks as his vice presidential candidate, `` you're going to find only shades of difference in our philosphy, not this chasm you find between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the one hand and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on the other. In his <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> interview, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> insisted that Democrats are unified despite <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s prodding on platform issues and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters' complaints about the selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as running mate. `` I ca n't remember a time when we've -LRB- the Democrats -RRB- been more together,'' he said. He said he thought the party reflected `` a broad national consensus'' on such issues as trade, plant closing, health care and the environment. `` I think that's the reason you just do n't have these deep ideological divisions that you often have had in the past.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention manager, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, said the two sides had already smoothed out most of their differences on the Democratic platform before <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called a halt to the formal negotiations. If the talks resume, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, `` we'd be close to signing off on it.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called a news conference in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, as his bus caravan wound southward toward the convention city. `` We simply can not win without each other. We can only win with each other,'' he said of himself and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` It is in our distinct advantage to find common ground.'' `` Given the creative tension in the past few days, taking a diplomatic initiative to get more people involved is the right thing to do,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said of the meetings of top aides set for the weekend. He refused to say whether he would challenge <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s vice presidential nomination, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he did n't know what would happen on that score. For his part, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to disclose the nature of his conversation with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. But he ruled out his rival's idea to have former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> play mediator in their pre-convention disagreements. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> also said he did n't think his services were needed. `` I do n't think they need any mediation. I think what is needed is to just have a better means of communication between one another,'' he added in an interview. Even before they made their comments, the idea seemed to be going nowhere. `` I do n't think, in my view, that the fact that there has been some miscommunication at this point requires the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to come to the table,'' Party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. A top <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aide also cast doubt on the idea, and <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, a confidant of both the former president and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, did as well. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> can deal with whatever they have to deal with,'' he said. The Democratic convention city was beginning to fill up with delegates _ and three out of every four belonged to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The few remaining uncommitted officials seemed headed toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' camp. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, for one, announced his support in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent time in his <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, grappling with budget difficulties for the current fiscal year and the one just ended. He is expected to travel to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Sunday, and will be nominated for president three nights later. In conversations with reporters, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would meet with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` at an appropriate time.'' He broke off negotiations on the platform earlier in the week, after learning of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s selection as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate from a reporter rather than from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> He also said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> could help mediate `` at the appropriate time,'' but his top aide, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, seemed to back away from the idea. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that any role for <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was `` not clear yet.'' Even before the Democrats formally convened, Republicans were working on their own convention, set to begin in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Aug. 15. The city won preliminary approval from the state's <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to borrow up to $ 30 million to help pay its share of convention costs.

<HEAD>Lehman Seeks Dismissal Of Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorneys for former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> asked a federal judge on Friday to dismiss a lawsuit filed by an executive of a defense contracting company who says he lost his job after publicly criticizing government spending. Other defendants in the lawsuit are <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>'s one-time deputies, defense consultant <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a staffer with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In the lawsuit, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korb </PERSON> claims officials at <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> removed him from his position as vice president in the nation's capital after they received complaints from <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON> about <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>'s public statements <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>, who joined <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, participated in a press conference in February 1986 at which he suggested the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> could maintain a strong force with a smaller budget. After that, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON> called <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>'s superiors, suggesting they tell the former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official to stop speaking out against the president's budget. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general concluded in a report released in November 1986 that while <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> did not direct <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> to called <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION>, he erred in condoning their actions. The report said the three then-Navy officials were wrong in complaining to <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> `` with the intention of restricting Dr. <PERSON> Korb </PERSON> from making public statements.'' But <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> that there is `` simply no case against <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> ... The calls were made by two of his assistant secretaries.'' Moreover, he said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials have every right to express their views to defense contractors. But <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>'s attorney, said that `` what these people were doing was wrong ... putting pressure on Dr. <PERSON> Korb </PERSON> to keep quiet.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> works for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which is representing <PERSON> Korb </PERSON> in his lawsuit in which he seeks $ 500,000 in damages. <PERSON> Korb </PERSON> is now associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal think tank. <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said he would rule shortly on whether to dismiss the lawsuit. The lawsuit is not related to the massive investigation into defense procurement practices. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> is a key figure in that probe, which centers on allegations that consultants paid bribes to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials to obtain classified information used to clinch multimillion-dollar contracts.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> must make `` further progress on reform'' to satisfy concerns that have prompted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to withhold dues from the world organization. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> were relayed to reporters by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> after a meeting between the two officials. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has withheld about $ 44 million in current contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> because of objections to its budget and personnel procedures. `` The president said that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognizes its obligations to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> but that further progress on reform was necessary to meet the concerns of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which the administration shares,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hopes the problem of overdue <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contributions to the world organization `` can be worked out.'' The White House spokesman listed three areas in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> desires <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> reforms: the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget-making process, the need for a 15 percent cut in <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel and the practice of short-term contracting of Soviet <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> employees so that they remain under their government's control instead of becoming <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> career employees. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> warned last last month that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget arrears of $ 691 million, including $ 467 million run up by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, would leave the organization out of money, with all its reserves exhausted, by late October or early November. He was expected to warn <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> might be unable to meet its payroll or other obligations. `` The secretary general was concerned that we have not been forthcoming with our share,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The $ 44 million was an amount the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sought to pay last year but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> held up until <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> certified progress on reforming the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget decision-making process and the two other areas of concern. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for international organizations, has described overall progress on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> reforms as encouraging but suggested the demands of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have not yet been fully met on the budget-decision making process. Posing for photographs with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acknowledged to reporters that recently there has been `` some problem again with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on this.''

 Food shortages and illnesses caused by stress are plaguing Armenians living in a disputed region trying to break away from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, a resident and the state-run media reported Friday. One resident, a journalist with the state broadcasting authority, claimed <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> authorities were preventing food from getting to the region, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. `` We are under a virtual economic blockade,'' said the journalist. `` The Azerbaijanis are trying to morally kill our movement, to strike down our just demands.'' The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, however, blamed the supply problems in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> on a nearly 2-month-old strike. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said more than 130 freight cars and more than 300 containers of food have backed up at the railway station in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s main city. `` There are no more fruits or vegetables in our shops,'' said the reporter, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name. `` We have almost no economic ties now with <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>.'' Ethnic Armenians make up more than three-quarters of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s 160,000 people and most are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. They have complained for months of economic, cultural and religious discrimination by the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> government. Early this year, they began protesting and demanded that control of the region, given to predominantly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923, be transferred to the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. In February, 32 people were killed in ethnic riots in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, 26 of them Armenians. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said residents were suffering because of the tensions in the region. `` The population of <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> is exhausted by the situation that has arisen. People have forgotten about weddings and family holidays. The incidence of illnesses caused by excessive stress has grown,'' the news agency reported. It said an Armenian resident was being sought after murdering his wife and two relatives, seriously wounding a 2-year-old child of his sister-in-law and trying to kill his son. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the suspect, G.S. <PERSON> Adamyan </PERSON>, has a criminal record but that the motive for the attack was not known. The journalist said <PERSON> Azerbaijaini </PERSON> authorities refused Thursday to allow a plane of the state-run airlines <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> from the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to land in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. Instead, the airliner touched down in the Armenian city of <LOCATION> Goris </LOCATION>, he said. The Azerbaijanis, the journalist added, have suspended bus service between <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> and the Armenian cities of <LOCATION> Kirovakan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kafan </LOCATION>, but buses have been leaving <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> with a police escort. The legislature of the Delaware-size region voted Tuesday to secede and join <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. But the Azerbaijani government voided the decision within hours. A general strike in solidarity with <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> residents, begun July 4, was continuing in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, sources said. <PERSON> Khovik </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasilyan </PERSON>, an Armenian activist, said by telephone from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that most of the factories in the city of 1.1 million people were still on strike but that transportation was functioning normally. Asked what the prospects were for resolving the 5-month-old dispute, a woman reached by phone in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> sighed and said: `` I do n't know what will happen. We are in a difficult situation.'' Soviet television reported Friday that many workers at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> alarm clock factory were idle and not receiving pay because an Armenian factory that makes electronic parts was on strike. The newscast portrayed life as normal in <LOCATION> Susha </LOCATION>, the second biggest city in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, despite what it said were rumors in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> residents had attacked Armenians there. Armenian activists have scheduled a rally outside <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s repository of ancient Armenian manuscripts for Saturday night They believe the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the highest legislative body in the Soviet government, will meet Monday and they hope it will consider the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> question. Soviet officials have said such a meeting is likely but have not given a date. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, said Thursday the work stoppage in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> had cost $ 65 million in lost production and that $ 29 million worth of construction had not been completed. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that about 20,000 Azerbaijanis living in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> had fled to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and that as of Wednesday, 7,265 Armenians who once lived in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> cities had returned to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> reluctantly yielded Friday to a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration demand that he leave the country, departing five minutes ahead of the deadline imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. But he took a parting shot at the administration, insisting that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action threatened the independence of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and saying his leftist government would seek recourse through <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> legal channels. Speaking at a crowded embassy news conference shortly before leaving for the airport, <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> said defiance of the expulsion order could give the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration an excuse `` to continue its aggression against our people.'' <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> and seven embassy colleagues were notified of the expulsion on Tuesday and were given until 5:30 p.m. EDT Friday to leave the country. They flew to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on a 5:25 p.m. flight and planned to go to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Saturday. About a dozen police officers were stationed at the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane's gate at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Two police vehicles followed the jet out onto the taxiway, then pulled out to the head of the runway and waited for it to take off. <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON>, who accompanied the envoy to news conference, said she and seven of the couple's children plan to remain in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> acted after eight American diplomats, including Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, were ordered home by the Nicaraguan government on Monday for alleged interference in the country's internal affairs. The administration described the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response as retaliatory and said that in the case of <LOCATION> Tunnermann </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s military attache, Major <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampson </PERSON>, the expulsion was also based on `` abuses'' of their privilege of residence. <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> served as both ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> and maintained throughout that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had no right to expel him, citing guarantees contained in the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> charter. The charter states that attendance at <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meetings shall `` not depend on bilateral relations'' between any member state and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which is host country for the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>. But the administration said a separate agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> authorizes the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to order any OAS diplomat home. Tunnermann repeatedly challenged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to present evidence of the wrongdoing he and <PERSON> Sampson </PERSON> were alleged to have engaged in. The administration has steadfastly refused, saying it was under no obligation to provide details. On Thursday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, said the administration had deferred expelling <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sampson </PERSON> earlier in order to avoid giving the Nicaraguan government a pretext for ordering home <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats. He added that the expulsion of the eight Americans this week `` removed the basis for such restraint on the part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> took his case to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> permanent council on Thursday but received little more than a polite hearing from most of his 31 colleagues there. A statement issued in the name of seven Latin American governments acknowledged that the rights of ambassadors against arbitrary expulsion are not adequately protected and said `` it is necessary to fill this legal vacuum.'' <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON>, who spent 3 -LCB- years here, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not have `` veto power'' over <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> appointees and that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would take action to defend the rights of ambassadors to immunity. <PERSON> Sofia </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, an embassy counselor, read a statement at the news conference in which she said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had set a `` dangerous precedent'' that threatened the independence of the OAS. Had Tunnermann chosen to remain in defiance of the order, he apparently would have been considered as an illegal alien. Even though <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law protects such aliens against summary expulsion and guarantees them a hearing, <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> elected to leave the country. He said, however, that he still considers himself to be <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ambassador Shortly before the news conference, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> to observe comply with the expulsion order by the deadline. Asked what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would do if <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> defied the deadline, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters, `` We're expecting him to leave at that hour. Beyond that hour, he is here illegally.'' `` I do n't know where he'll hide,'' the president said, indicating the government would enforce its expulsion order if necessary. `` He's illegally here beyond that period of time. We expect him to be going to the airport or to leave.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Defends Use of Taxes and Borrowing to Close State Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defended his use of taxes and borrowing to cover a state budget shortfall as he awaited final legislative action on the plan before heading to the Democratic convention. In an interview Friday with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in his Statehouse office, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rejected any comparisons between his borrowing and the federal deficit spending of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` Obviously, we're not going to do anything around here that jeopardizes our credit rating. If all goes well, we'll come out of this with some end-of-year surplus,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> predicted. He also defended his recent signing of a $ 24 million sales tax on cigarettes on the grounds that it would pay for the first year phase-in of his universal health care plan. `` If we did n't have the health care bill, we would n't have needed that. Frankly, I think that's a modest price to pay for the first universal health care bill in the history of this country,'' the governor said. He acknowledged, however, that the cigarette tax would not pay for universal health insurance in later years when the program becomes more expensive. He did not address himself to the other revenue measures proposed to shore up next year's state budget. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did show a willingness to tangle with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if the expected Republican presidential nominee accuses him of being a tax-raiser. `` Let'em do it,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who recently accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of violating a no-new-taxes pledge by supporting a federal catastrophic illness health care bill that calls for $ 6 billion in new revenues. `` I have n't heard much the last week or two from the vice president on the subject, since his no-tax pledge has disappeared. And I do n't think you're going to hear much,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. As he spoke Friday afternoon, an $ 11.75 billion budget for the current fiscal year was awaiting his signature. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would use his line-item veto to reduce the total, but he would not say how. At the same time, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is awaiting a package of bills designed to close a deficit in last year's budget that ranges from the administration's estimate of $ 370 million to as much as $ 470 million projected by some legislators. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has proposed closing the budget gap through converting some $ 200 million in operating expenses into long-term bonds, tapping a $ 27 million pension system surplus and diverting $ 50 million in surplus lottery proceeds from local government. In addition, to shore up next year's budget, the governor is seeking to raise more than $ 200 million by closing corporate tax `` loopholes,'' re-coupling the state income tax with federal law and collecting unclaimed bottle deposits. The governor traced his budget problems to an unanticipated _ and, he says, unforeseeble _ downturn in state tax collections this spring. `` Remember this,'' he said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, as recently as three months ago, gave us a revised report, which forecast a $ 70 million shortfall for FY88 and a $ 40 million shortfall for FY89. `` Now, if that revised forecast had been accurate, it would have been like a day at the beach,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. According to the governor, he and legislative leaders made a decision last year to take advantage of the now-evaporated state budget surplus by paying cash for some highway and building repair projects that normally would have been funded through bonds. Now, faced with a shortfall, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he is simply shifting the funds back into a category where they belonged all along.

<HEAD>Pentagon Announces `Special Procedures' for Future Contracts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In a new reaction to the ongoing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday it is requiring `` special procedures'' for future contracts with 16 defense firms. The procedures will include a certification that none of the companies improperly obtained inside information relating to contracts, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The contractors also will be required to include a clause in contracts permitting the government to recapture profits if it is later determined the company won the contract through `` illegal or improper activity,'' the Pentagon said. The announcement results from the investigation into allegations that private defense consultants, many of whom are former military or <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, paid bribes to current <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees for inside information about contracts. That information could be crucial in winning contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. No charges have yet been filed in the two-year-old case, which became public a month ago when search warrants were served across the country on a number of contractors and consultants. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announcement said the procedures will affect future contracts worth more than $ 100,000 and is `` an interim measure designed to protect the government's interests.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the list of 16 companies could be expanded `` as additional information becomes available.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it was acting because the contractors, or their subsidiaries, `` either were the subject of search warrants in connection with the ongoing procurement investigation, or other official information currently available that requires certification of business integrity prior to awarding of future contracts.'' The list includes some of the nation's largest defense contractors, including <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>. Two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> announced he was suspending contracts in nine military programs worth $ 1 billion because of the possibility they may have been tainted. He said he was acting on the basis of information contained in an affidavit unsealed by a federal court in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> rescinded that action Monday and told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a review of the contracts had found no problems with the pacts. But he also said action should be taken as a warning to contractors that the Pentagon would act if questions were raised about future contracts. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has the legal authority to recoup profits if the money turns out to have been earned through some illegality. But members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have been pushing for inclusion of a separate clause in future contracts to spell out that right more clearly. The firms affected by Friday's announcement include <ORGANIZATION> Armtec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Palatka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cubic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Commack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Kane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whittaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Zubier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Get Rid of Cash-Based Accounting in U.S. Government, GAO Says</HEAD>

 The federal government should adopt uniform accounting principles to replace some 200 separate, antiquated systems it now uses, and create a chief financial officer to oversee the entire financial picture, according to a report released Thursday. `` There is a recognition today that most of the government's accounting systems are outdated, inefficient and ineffective, and that improvements in financial management are urgently needed,'' said the report by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative `` Getting this <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report is really important because it confirms our worst fears,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who says he is the only practicing certified public accountant in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are so many aspects to what is structurally and systemically wrong.'' <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, released the report at a news conference. The report had been requested by <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, the ranking Republican on the Government Operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs. Among the report's recommendations: _ Create a federal chief financial officer within the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> who would have the power to oversee and direct the financial management, accounting and budget systems of the federal government; _ Prepare audited financial statements every year in every major department and agency; _ Change from the current cash-basis -LRB- one-year -RRB- accounting system to a long and short term, or accrual, system; _ Adopt uniform accounting systems in every department and major agency, replacing the more than 200 systems `` We've got to get some better accountability, some better controls and some better information,'' said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s accounting and financial management division, who attended the news conference.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spent Friday in closed meetings with other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders, and his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, where 4 million people were killed in Nazi death camps. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals for new efforts to break a deadlock with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> over reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, already rejected by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, were among the topics for discussion in the first of two days of private talks. A brief official report of the proceedings said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the other leaders addressed the opening-day session, but gave no details. They met in the Council of Ministers Palace, where the Treaty of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> was signed in 1955 to formalize the political and military alliance. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> later reported dinner toasts by <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and Polish leader <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> called for talks aimed at eliminating short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ those with ranges up to 300 miles, which are not included in the U.S.-Soviet treaty to scrap medium-range weapons, the agency said. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals for talks on reducing conventional forces were `` valuable, original initiatives'' and were discussed in the first day's session. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> returned to southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which the <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON> visited earlier in the week, to memorialize those who died during World War II in the <LOCATION> Auschwitz-Birkenau </LOCATION> extermination camp. She laid bouquets of red carnations at Execution Wall and at the Russian-language tablet that is part of an international monument to the dead. Wiping a tear from her cheek, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said after touring the camp that almost 50 years since the beginning of World War II the camp still reminds the living of `` the hope, human fear and bravery'' of its inmates. `` It should remind us all that what is most precious in this world is the right to live and be free,'' she said in brief remarks broadcast by state television. Soviet forces liberated <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, built by the Germans after they occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> at the beginning of the war, in January 1945 and it has been preserved as a museum. The gas chambers and crematoria of <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION> were largely destroyed by retreating German forces, and the site is marked by a stone monument and tablets in many languages. The combined camp was the center of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s effort to wipe out European Jews, millions of whom lived in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and Nazi-occupied regions of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Next to Poles, both Jew and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, more than 1 million Soviet citizens made up the largest single nationality among the victims. Soviet prisoners of war received particularly harsh treatment in the slave-labor sections of the complex. News coverage of Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit, the first event of the six-day visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> when she did not accompany her husband, was restricted to Soviet and Polish media. The meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s political-consultative council is the first since the fourth Gorbachev-Reagan summit six weeks ago in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It also was the Soviet leader's first opportunity to brief his allies on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference at the end of June, which reiterated his policy of encouraging economic and social reform. When he arrived Monday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed that negotiators from East and West meet informally to seek ways of breaking the impasse that for years has blocked mutual reductions of conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> issued a statement saying appropriate forums already exist in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and elsewhere for discussing arms reduction and that any such talks should include representatives of all <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries.

<TEXT>
 In more than a half-century as a Teamster, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> learned the highways around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the paths to power and did it with a tough but low-key style. `` He's not the type to make a lot of publicity,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeRusha </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 10, which represents 55,000 Teamsters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` He works hard and cares about the union movement. He's respected by everyone here, but he keeps a low profile.'' Such anonymity may be difficult now for <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 69, who was selected president of the nation's largest labor union Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' 17-member General Executive Board over Secretary-Treasurer <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, whom former union President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> had named acting president May 4. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, 61, who died of cancer Saturday, had been under federal indictment on charges of labor racketeering and embezzlement. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> takes control of a 1.6 million-member union that routinely makes headlines for its influence in political campaigns and reputed links to organized crime. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> is one of 19 present and former Teamster leaders named defendants in a government suit trying to seize control of the union through a court-appointed trustee, claiming its leadership is either controlled by organized crime figures or incapable of removing its influence. Among the allegations in the suit, filed two weeks ago, is that mob bosses in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were behind the elevation of <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to the union's presidency in 1981 and supported <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> in 1983. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who has a reputation of being a tough negotiator with a quick temper, will serve out the remainder of <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s five-year term, which expires in 1991 when the union holds its next international convention. Apart from the latest federal takeover suit and several investigations of alleged Teamster misconduct in the early 1980s, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> has ruled the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> without much public scrutiny. `` I think his reputation as a hard-working, well-organized leader had a lot to do with his selection,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think anyone under fire wants to look to turn things around. They think <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> is the best person to motivate that union and move it forward.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> began his full-time union activity in the early 1940s negotiating contracts and handling grievances as the youngest business agent ever at Local 25 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION> section. By the mid-1960s, he had risen to secretary-treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and was elected president four years later. He will retain the regional post in addition to his national responsibilities, said <PERSON> DeRusha </PERSON>. Upward career mobility also allowed <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> to move from <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION> to suburban <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, where he raised four children and lives with his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. In early 1982, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was called to testify in a 31-count federal case against three members of Teamsters Local 25 accused of defrauding movie outfits filming in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> by arranging pay for absent union members. The next year, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and eight other trustees in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Teamster Pension fund agreed to pay $ 205,000 as settlement of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suit that alleged the trustees violated federal regulations by allowing the fund's investment advisor to receive commissions on real estate investments. There are no other current <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigations that include <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, according to a department spokesman in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrick </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> for nearly 45 years, believes his appointment may help stem problems at the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's come from the bottom to the very top and he knows what it is to take hard knocks and barely have enough to eat,'' said <PERSON> Herrick </PERSON>, 70, president of the 1,100-member Local 25 retirees chapter. `` He's a hard man and a tough negotiator, but he's fair. He's a Teamster's Teamster. That's what we need now.''

 <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, the wife of Soviet emigre writer <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, on Friday denied a German radio report that she and her husband would return to their homeland for a visit and that his works would be published there. `` Everything is -LRB- a -RRB- lie. Everything is false,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press from her home in <LOCATION> Cavendish </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt </LOCATION>. The Munich-based <ORGANIZATION> Bayerischer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio station said <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> and his wife planned to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in November or December and that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wanted to publish all his works, including the novella `` Cancer Ward'' and `` The Gulag Archipelago.'' It said the information came from its correspondent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the New York-based correspondent said <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s wife told him by telephone Wednesday that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had written two letters to her husband with offers to return and to have <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s works published in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The correspondent asked that his name not be used. Mrs. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> said, `` I never talked to -LRB- an -RRB- unnamed reporter from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' `` I can not confirm -LRB- the report -RRB-,'' she said. She also said she could not speculate on the report's origin or motive. `` I have no idea. I have no comment at all.'' Earlier, Mrs. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, who rarely speaks to reporters, spoke to an aide to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt., and denied that her husband had received letters from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> The aide, <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, quoted her as saying, `` It's a lie. The interviews never took place ... It's absurd.'' <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> incurred the wrath of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Communist leadership with novels such as `` One Day in the Life of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Denisovich </PERSON>,'' `` Cancer Ward'' and `` The First Circle,'' as well as the non-fiction work `` The Gulag Archipelago,'' an expose of terror and hopelessness in Soviet labor camps. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970. In February 1974, <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> was arrested, formally accused of treason, stripped of his citizenship and deported to the West. In June, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalygin </PERSON>, editor of the Soviet monthly Novy Mir, said negotiations for publishing `` Cancer Ward'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were under way. However, Mrs. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying at the time that Soviet officials had not approached <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> about publishing any of his works in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said Friday she will talk about the American family, the Republican record and her admiration for both <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his rival, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in her keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, 54, said the Democrats are more unified than at any other time in her lifetime, despite the rift that developed this week between the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camps over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' failure to notify <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in advance of his selection of Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as his running mate. `` What you have here are two superb leaders, two bright individuals, two of our party's best. And I think that, whatever the difficulties, they will be able to resolve those,'' she said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said at a news conference that she did not intend to focus in her Monday night speech on the estrangement that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been feeling from the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. Since the dispute over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate occurred on Tuesday, contacts between the two campaigns have been initiated to discuss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role in the Democrats' plans for November. `` I'm going to talk about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because I think he's been a passionate, energetic and exciting voice in this country and I want to compliment him for that,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said Mentioning general themes of her speech without revealing specifics, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> said she would speak about <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the last eight years under a Republican administration and will laud the records of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. She said she also would talk about `` the American family,'' an issue popular this year with both Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives. `` It's something I feel like I've lived,'' she said She noted the dramatic, crowd-rousing speech given by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> at the Democratic convention four years ago and said the issues he talked about _ such as homelessness, drugs and ghettos _ still are important in the country.

<TEXT>
 Authorities will begin moving about 17,000 Cambodian refugees from the Khao-I-Dang camp to a location closer to the Thai-Cambodian border, a military commander said Friday. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries have expressed concern about the refugees' safety if they are moved from <LOCATION> Khao-I-Dang </LOCATION>, whic is eight miles from the frontier. Thousands of Cambodians have entered <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to escape the war in their country between guerrilla forces and Vietnamese and government troops. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978, ousted the radical <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime and installed another communist government. Most of the Cambodians settled in camps along the border, and <PERSON> Khao-I-Dang </PERSON> is considered the only refugee camp not controlled by the differerent guerrilla groups. It also is the only camp where there is an official program to resettle the refugees in other countries. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> had declared on Dec. 31, 1986, that it would close Khao-I-Dang, but only a small number of refugees were forced to leave. Col. <PERSON> Sanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kajornklam </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>'s Joint Operations Center, spoke of moving the refugees at a meeting Friday. Later, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sanan </PERSON> said that within three months authorities will start moving the <LOCATION> Khao-I-Dang </LOCATION> refugees to the area of Site 2 close to the border. Site 2 adjoins the Ban Thad camp where the government, trying to discourage more Indochinese from entering <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, has placed about 3,000 Vietnamese refugees. <PERSON> Sanan </PERSON> said the Khao-I-Dang refugees would be resettled because they have not been accepted by other countries and they must prepare to return to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` If we close Khao-I-Dang, the Cambodians will know that they must go home,'' <PERSON> Sanan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kobsak </PERSON> <PERSON> Chutikul </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s Social Afffairs Division, said that in its plans to move the <LOCATION> Khao-I-Dang </LOCATION> refugees the government will follow three objectives that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> outlined in a letter to the government last year. He said those objectives are that the new site be safe, that it be neutral and that the refugees remain under the protection of the office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees.

 A company accused of reneging on a drought insurance offer said Friday it would issue an additional $ 10 million in total coverage for farmers in 10 <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> states. But one insurance official said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s plan was unacceptable. Federal, a subsidiary of Warren-based <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, has been accused of backing off a promise to issue policies that pay off if rainfall falls below a certain level. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> says the flood of applications in the final days of the enrollment period, which lasted from May 1 to June 17, exceeded the amount of coverage it wanted to provide, and that it can not fill all the applications. The company initially planned to issue $ 30 million but increased the total coverage to $ 40 million, which will protect about 800 farmers. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it made the decision after talking with insurance commissioners in the affected states. The 6,000 farmers who do not receive insurance will get twice the amount of their premium returned, said <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Korkuch </PERSON>. Premiums already have been returned to insurance agents, she said. Another 1,000 farmers whose applications were received June 16 or later will get only their premium back, she said. `` -LRB- Farmers -RRB- are n't losing money,'' she said. `` They just might not get the insurance they want.'' Applications for about $ 350 million in total coverage are not being accepted because they exceed the $ 40 million limit, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said Friday any assertion that it was bound to accept all applications was `` without merit'' and would be subject to a `` very vigorous defense.'' The company said nearly all the applications clearly indicate that policies would be issued only after acceptance by the insurer. `` It's hogwash,'' <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> said of that contention. `` The application form we approved for use in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> specifically provides that once the premium is submitted, coverage is bound,'' <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> said. `` We simply are not going to tolerate, by analogy, a company that issues a policy, finds out that the building is burning and says, ` Whoops we really did n't mean we were going to cover the loss,''' the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> commissioner said. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> officials said their states are prepared to take legal action if necessary, while <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> will seek to revoke the company's state license to do business if it does not provide the coverage. An estimated 450 <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> farmers applied and sent in premiums for the insurance, said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rector </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>. About 10 percent of them would be covered under <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal, he said. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> estimates 1,000 farmers from his state applied for a total of $ 40 million in coverage. Other states whose farmers sought the coverage are <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` We increased our capacity for this program from $ 30 million to $ 40 million in the hope that this additional coverage will provide help to <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> farmers during this very difficult period,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said in a written statement. Lawsuits have been filed against <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> farmers, alleging the company acted in bad faith by reneging on the insurance. And some farmers in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> told an agent to send the premium refunds back to <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> and demand the coverage be provided. <PERSON> Rector </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> has not been threatened with license revocation in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, but `` we've told them that the department's position is they're on the hook. Ms. <PERSON> Korkuch </PERSON> said she could not comment on the lawsuits and said they have not been resolved. She also said she had no comment on what the company would do if farmers refuse to accept the refunds.

 An 8-year-old boy who had no heartbeat and a body temperature of only 70 degrees after spending four hours trapped in a freezer died Friday, 21 hours after he was discovered by his father, hospital officials said. Although medical personnel had managed to get <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogg </PERSON>'s heart beating and return his body temperature to normal, he made no further progress, said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Yousey </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Babies </ORGANIZATION>' and Children's `` He was put on life support, and he never regained consciousness,'' Ms. <PERSON> Yousey </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> arrived at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> at 7 p.m. Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> told the boy's father, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogg </PERSON>, the chances of resuscitating him were one in a million. Icicles had formed on his body, and his heart had stopped beating. But doctors began an elaborate process of rewarming <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s body by running tubes of warm saline through his stomach and bladder and wrapping him in electric blankets About 11 p.m., <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s heart began to beat again, and by 1 a.m. Friday he had a strong pulse and good blood pressure and his temperature returned to normal, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. The youth was then air-lifted 35 miles to Rainbow Babies' and Children's Hospital in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, where he died at 4:02 p.m. Friday. The youth was reported missing by his parents around 5 p.m. Thursday, said Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Monia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sheffield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. His father found him at 6:30 p.m. when he went to the freezer in the family's garage to get meat for dinner. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> had apparently fallen into the freezer while trying to reach some Popsicles, <PERSON> Monia </PERSON> said. A discarded battery had been pushed in front of the freezer to act as a step for the youth, he said. `` It appears he crawled up on the battery and tumbled in,'' <PERSON> Monia </PERSON> said. `` The lid closed on him and latched.'' Because of the location of the freezer, any pounding or yelling would not be heard by anyone, the father said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said doctors believed it a miracle the boy survived as long as he did. While some drowning victims have revived after up to an hour in similar freezing conditions, said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, `` we've never had anyone survive so long. This is what makes it so unusual.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> leader Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> decreed on state television Friday night what he described as a decentralization program aimed at helping the poor. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, led by a coordinator and 77 advisers, is aimed at encouraging the poor to `` be the artisans of their own destiny'' by taking part in local decision-making. The bureau will coordinate small-scale development projects, such as the building of latrines, wells, lower-class living quarters and repairing roads. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> after only four months of civilian rule in a coup on June 19. His plan is highly similar to the development program <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> outlined in his platform, calling for decentralized decision-making and self-help projects in the countryside. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said in his 10-minute speech Friday, `` The government has decided to implant a dynamic administrative structure ... in accordance with the demands of the population.'' <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> added that <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s social inequalities are `` clearly unacceptable.'' Most Haitians earn less than $ 300 a year each, making this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation of 6 million the poorest in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> shares the island of <LOCATION> Hispaniola </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The general said his program `` calls for the direct participation of everyone. This form of decentralization is a school for democracy.'' The decree says the bureau's mission `` consists in facilitating the voluntary participation of the rural population by identifying their needs, defining priorities and executing small projects selected by the executive.'' In a speech in June in which <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> announced his intention to do away with the constitution overwhelmingly approved by Haitians in March 1987, the general said Haitians were too poor to enjoy democracy. `` It is obviously illusory to think that the full enjoyment of... rights and liberties is possible in the context of absolute poverty in which nearly 70 percent of the population of the country is vegetating,'' he said then Friday's decree was the second major one since <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> took power last month. On July 12, the government abolished the death penalty, though it had already been abolished in the 1987 constitution.

 The murder of a 19-year-old black woman whose body was found with `` KKK'' carved on her leg is being investigated as possibly racially motivated, a prosecutor said Friday. District Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON> said he talked with Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> about the case Friday and <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> had pledged `` full support of state resources'' to help with the case. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON>, 19, was found dead Tuesday, but information about the letters on her leg were not released until Thursday. The letters were written with a sharp instrument, said <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON>, who refused to comment on many aspects of the investigation. `` As far as racial involvement, we are concerned,'' <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON> said. `` We are concerned.'' Preliminary autopsy results indicated Miss <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON> was strangled and struck on the head with a blunt instrument, police said. A bite on the neck and other marks also were found on her body. Miss <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON> had last been seen Monday evening at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grill </ORGANIZATION>, a few doors down from the alleyway where her blood-stained sweatsuit was found. Her partly clothed body was found another block away. While <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON> would n't comment on reports that Miss <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON> was a drug addict, the woman's father told the <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeman </ORGANIZATION> that his daughter had fallen victim to drugs. `` I'm almost positive it was a drug rub,'' <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON> told the newspaper. The only arrest in the case came Wednesday, when a man police described as a transient was charged with engaging in sexual contact with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON>'s corpse. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON>, 41, being held on $ 10,000 bail, told radio station <ORGANIZATION> WDST </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> Thursday night that he was innocent of any charges and thought <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON>'s body was a life-sized, pornographic doll when he saw it. `` I never saw a dead body before,'' <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON> said. `` I looked down and touched it and it felt like rubber, sort of warm and sort of cold.'' <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON> said when he saw the head wound, he `` flipped out'' and ran to call police. While <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON> was being questioned, <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON> said Friday that there was still no suspect in the murder. There are `` similiarities'' between the murder and the <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case, but there was no evidence of a connection in the cases, <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> was found last November with the letters `` KKK'' and racial epithets scrawled in a charcoal-like substance on her skin after being missing for four days. She later said she had been abducted and raped by a group of white men, but she and her family have refused to cooperate with the investigation. <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> is about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, on the opposite shore of the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. On Friday, <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> advisers the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and lawyer <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> arrived at the Ulster County Jail to conduct what they said would be their own investigation of the murder. `` If our investigation leads to the <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, then we'll go there,'' <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> advisers' appearance in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> was `` a nightmare come true.'' State Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the special prosecutor in the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case, said he would push the grand jury investigating it to begin writing a report next month on what it believes happened to the black teen-ager during the four days she was missing late last year. `` There may not have been any crime committed here,'' he said in an interview about the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case reported Friday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION>. `` If a crime, or crimes, were committed, then you would surmise that there would be suspects.'' But <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said his investigation had turned up no suspects.

 Police say a routine license-plate check led to the arrest of five alleged members of a violent polygamist sect linked to killings in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other states. The five people in custody in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> were identified this week as children or followers of the late polygamist cult leader <PERSON> Ervil </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>. Authorities were still seeking at least seven other alleged members of the cult. <PERSON> Ervil </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Heber </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, 27; and four people described as <PERSON> Heber </PERSON>'s siblings or half siblings were arrested July 1 on investigation of auto theft charges after a stolen truck was found at a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> motel at which they were staying. Authorities at first released three of the five on bail before realizing through fingerprint checks and other clues that the five were linked to the cult. The three were then rearrested. All had given false names and dates of birth, said Sgt. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> police department. `` There was no evidence at the time to hold them,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` There was no connection to the <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> cult until -LRB- Wednesday -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the initial arrests were triggered when a police sergeant running license checks July 1 on vehicles in a motel parking lot found a pickup truck reported stolen in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heber </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> and two of his half brothers who are still at large, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, are wanted for questioning in the June 27 execution-style slayings in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> of three men and an 8-year-old girl. Some of the cult members are also wanted for questioning in an October 1987 killing in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, authorities said. `` Of course we're glad, but we're not totally relieved until the others are -LRB- arrested -RRB- too,'' said <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Chynoweth </PERSON>, mother of two of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> victims and grandmother of the 8-year-old girl. She is also the grandmother of <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> in the group's complicated, poligamy-based family tree The senior <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, 56, died in 1981 of a heart attack at the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> State Prison. He had been sentenced to a life term for masterminding the 1977 gunshot slaying of a rival polygamist. Although the Utah-based Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day Saints now excommunicates those who advocate or practice polygamy, authorities estimate that 20,000 to 30,000 people live a religion-based polygamist lifestyle in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and neighboring states. Observers of the <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> cult have said the group believes in `` blood atonement,'' or the killing of members who have left the group. The Oct. 16, 1987, slaying in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, 53, of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; and the June 27 killings in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Chynoweth </PERSON>, 31; his daughter, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, 8; his brother, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, 36; and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marston </PERSON>, 32; brought to 18 the number of <PERSON> Ervil </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>'s former disciples, family members and critics who have died or disappeared in the last 22 years from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> None of those in custody has been charged in the recent killings. The five were charged with operating an illegal enterprise and are believed to have run an auto-theft ring in the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area for several months, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> <PERSON> Heber </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> also is being held on an aggravated robbery charge stemming from a <LOCATION> Richardson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, savings and loan robbery. Another suspect, identified through fingerprints as <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON>, 28, also faces a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> charge of burglary out of an auto, police said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Loughney </PERSON> identified the other three in custoy as <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tarsa </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, all `` either full, half or quarter or whatever sisters or brothers'' of <PERSON> Heber </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>.

 Rebels mounted three attacks in northern and central <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in violation of a truce with the Sandinista government, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Its report said three of the U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, and one civilian were killed in the fighting and the Contras kidnapped 20 people. The ministry statement said that in one of the attacks on Thursday, three Contras died in a shootout with an army patrol in northern <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION> province. It also said the Contras ambushed an army truck in northern <LOCATION> Jinotega </LOCATION> province, kidnapping 16 people on board, and that four other people were abducted by the rebels and a civilian was killed in central Chontales province. The statement gave no details of the fighting and said nothing of any government casualties. The Contras and the leftist Sandinista government have accused each other of truce violations on and off since the cease-fire began March 21. Representatives from both sides held meetings to try to reach a peace accord without success. The last round of talks in June ended in deadlock and no new meetings were scheduled. The Sandinistas celebrate nine years in power next Tuesday. The insurrection they led in July 1979 ended 42 years of rule by the rightist, pro-American Somoza dynasty. The army announced on Friday a series of military exercises to defend <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the capital, in case of attack. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have long claimed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> eventually plans to invade <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> expelled <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats, accusing them of conspiring to undermine the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday night the suspension of the radio program `` El Despertar'' -LRB- The Awakening -RRB- for `` transmitting false information.'' The statement, read over state-run radio, did not say how long the suspension would be in effect. Last week the government closed down the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>; suspended publication for 15 days of the only opposition newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, and earlier this week expropriated <LOCATION> Ingenio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, the country's leading sugar refinery Business leaders called the takeover of the company, belonging to the wealthy <PERSON> Pellas </PERSON> family, a setback for private enterprise. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reacted to the expulsion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats by ordering out Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> and seven embassy colleagues. <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> reluctantly bowed to the order and departed on Friday, five minutes ahead of the deadline imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> issued a statement saying <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> would remain as <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` until this controversy can be elucidated.'' The statement reiterated <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s position that as <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, Tunnermann can not be barred from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> despite his expulsion as ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> called for the <ORGANIZATION> InterAmerican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to resolve the dispute.

<HEAD>Teller Claimed X-Ray Laser Could Destroy All Land-Based Soviet
Missiles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hydrogen bomb developer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON> once told a top administration arms control adviser that a proposed `` Star Wars'' laser could `` potentially shoot down the entire Soviet land-based missile force,'' a congressional report says. That and some other details in the report back the charge by a disaffected former director of the X-ray laser research program that <PERSON> Teller </PERSON> made unsupportable claims about the potential of the proposed weapon, Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Friday. `` Let me plead guilty to the great crime of optimism,'' Teller countered Friday. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> resigned in 1985 as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>'s research program into the X-ray laser because of the dispute, and said he was demoted to an entry-level job. Last year, <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> filed grievances alleging that Teller and another scientist, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, made `` overly optimistic, technically incorrect statements regarding this research to the nation's highest policy-makers.'' He also accused <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Batzel </PERSON>, then the lab's director, of blocking his efforts to correct those statements. An internal study eventually concluded that <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> was made into an `` unperson'' because of his dispute with <PERSON> Batzel </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report, written at <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s request, cited some optimistic statements by Teller and <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> but also concluded that <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> and his colleagues at <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION> shared that optimism to some extent `` The report is trying to straddle the fence,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said by phone from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It says that <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> made similar -LRB- optimistic -RRB- statements, but that in a couple of instances _ the two <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> objected to most _ the statements -LRB- by Teller and Wood -RRB- were indeed overly optimistic and not factual.'' Teller, interviewed by telephone from <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, contended the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report backs his point of view. The report, he said, shows that <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON>'s criticisms were over the way Teller worded his claims, but that <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> `` supported -LRB- them -RRB- in substance.'' The claim about the laser being able to shoot down all 10,000 Soviet land-based missiles sounds absurd because it was quoted out of context, the physicist said. `` I tried to illustrate the possibly great effects that the X-ray laser might produce,'' Teller said. `` If you read the letter, you will find qualifiers: ` eventually,' ` potentially' and ` perhaps.''' In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> also contended that the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report generally backs his point of view, but he had some criticism for it. The report, he said Friday, `` establishes everything I ever alleged, but I am very unhappy with the finding that suggests there was a great deal of similarity between Dr. <PERSON> Teller </PERSON> and myself.'' `` He was an enthusiast for the X-ray laser and I was an enthusiast. But the points we differed on were very important,'' <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> said, adding, `` I am still struggling to tell the truth against what I would call reprisals.'' A space-based system of X-ray laser beams, powered by nuclear detonations, is no longer viewed as the centerpiece of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, known as SDI or Star Wars SDI research now focuses on land-based weapons to defend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Meese Disturbed By Trend Toward Appointment Of Independent
Counsels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Outgoing Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told a group of judges and lawyers Friday that he objects to the use of independent counsels to investigate the executive branch because they are `` for all intents and purposes unaccountable.'' Without elaborating, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said it is not inconceivable to him that someday an independent counsel could be used by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to control the presidency. `` Taken to its logical conclusion, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people could be effectively deprived of their right to vote for the chief executive of their own choosing if these fundamental rights are taken away piecemeal by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. The attorney general himself was recently the target of an investigation by an independent counsel. `` The creation of such an independent office takes important government functions away from politically accountable officials and transfers them to ad hoc officials who practically have no mechanism for control and who are for all intents and purposes unaccountable,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. The remarks came in a speech, focusing on the separation of powers, to lawyers and judges attending the <ORGANIZATION> 8th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. Enacted in the post-Watergate era, the 1978 Ethics In Government Act set up a system of court-appointed special prosecutors, subsequently renamed independent counsels, to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by top officials in the Executive Branch. On June 29, in a defeat for the administration, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> voted 7-1 to uphold the constitutionality of the 1978 law. In reference to that opinion, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said: `` How do you determine where the line will be drawn? Since the court itself drew no concrete lines, some may contend that it's possible that virtually any executive function could be relegated to an independent office so long as it does not positively disable the president from accomplishing his constitutional role. And ` positively disabling' is in itself a somewhat subjective standard. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the president needs to `` stand up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' as it attempts to acquire more power over the White House. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has said he will leave his post with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration by next month. He made the announcement after saying he was vindicated when independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> filed a report with a federal appeals court signifying he had decided not to seek criminal charges against the attorney general. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> spent 14 months looking into <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement with, among other things, the bankrupt military contractor <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil-pipeline project. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has referred his report to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> could consider whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had done anything unethical. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had refrained from commenting on the independent counsel process while he was under investigation by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> removed himself from participation in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s filing of a court brief raising objections to the independent counsel statute. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said if the trend continued, it would not be `` stretching the imagination'' to envision the appointment of an independent `` arms procurement czar'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> or an independent <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> controller as a response to the July 3 downing of the Iranian civilian airliner. In a brief news conference after his speech, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he approved of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s choice of former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> as his successor. `` I think he's an excellent choice,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. `` He's a man I've known for a long time, he's a good friend and I think he and I think alike on almost every aspect of law enforcement.''

 Massive thunderstorms packing tornadoes and wind gusts up to 92 mph slammed into <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bluffs </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, on Friday, injuring at least 40 people and damaging more than 100 homes. One tornado uprooted trees, downed power lines, started fires and overturned railroad cars in a 2-mile stretch in western Council Bluffs along Interstate 29 and the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which divides the two cities. Most of Council Bluffs' 60,000 residents were without power Friday night and the situation was not expected to change through morning, said <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Daunis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Council Bluffs Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanafan </PERSON> ordered a curfew from 10 p.m. to dawn to guard against looting Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patroled the streets. An <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> man was reported in critical condition with neck and possible internal injuries after a tree crashed onto the roof of his car. Most other injuries were minor, said officials of three hospitals who counted a total of 40 people treated for storm-related injuries. Exits off Interstate 29 into Council Bluffs were closed and the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> sealed off the area most heavily damaged. Possible tornadoes and funnel clouds were reported throughout the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> area as hail fell and more than 2 inches of rain caused street flooding. `` We went to the hallway and we were praying very hard,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bluffs </ORGANIZATION> resident <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzenhauser </PERSON>, who was baby-sitting for two children when the storm hit her neighborhood. Ms. <PERSON> Guzenhauser </PERSON> and the children were not injured. However, part of the tool shed behind her house was hanging from power lines in the front of her home after the storm. Trees as thick as 48 inches in diameter snapped in half in <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bluffs </ORGANIZATION> and others as tall as 100-feet were uprooted at <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Course </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. In the worst 2-mile stretch in Council Bluffs, the tops of hundreds of trees were sawed off by the twister, sidewalks were uplifted and roofs were blown off houses.

<TEXT>
 Iraqi forces chased Iranian troops out of one of two strategic positions they still held in north <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Thursday, another victory in a drive to regain all territory seized by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the 8-year war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> admitted its troops withdrew from the mountain town of <LOCATION> Hajj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Omran </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Sulaimaniya </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s powerful <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and acting commander in chief of the armed forces, declared that after the recent military setbacks, his country should prepare for a long-term war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. Thursday's retreat was the third by the Iranians in that area in three days. It came as Iraqi troops launched widespread mopup operations in the south, tightening their grip on areas recently evacuated by the Iranians. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, broke into regular programming to announce the fall of <PERSON> Hajj </PERSON> <PERSON> Omran </PERSON> after a fierce battle between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said Iranian combatants in <PERSON> Hajj </PERSON> <PERSON> Omran </PERSON> withdrew to `` new defensive positions ... The evacuation ... is for a more appropriate deployment of combat forces in other defensive lines.'' <PERSON> Hajj </PERSON> <PERSON> Omran </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Penjwin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> are all in the <LOCATION> Sulaimaniya </LOCATION> region, which is inhabited by Iranian-backed, autonomy-seeking Kurdish rebels. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> captured the region in an offensive last March. It claimed at the time that 5,000 Kurds were killed and 7,000 injured in <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> when the Iraqis pounded the town with chemical weapons despite a world ban on such weapons. The Iranians admitted withdrawing from <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> on Tuesday and the Iraqis said on Wednesday that they regained the <LOCATION> Penjwin </LOCATION> basin. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said only that its forces are regrouping in <LOCATION> Penjwin </LOCATION>. That left the Iranians entrenched only in the town of <LOCATION> Penjwin </LOCATION>, encircled by Iraqis on all the surrounding mountain peaks. In the south, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops continued to consolidate positions in areas they retook from the Iranians in four consecutive thrusts since April, the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. The Iraqis captured the Zubaidat region in a four-hour battle Tuesday and chased the fleeing troops on Wednesday all the way to <LOCATION> Dehloran </LOCATION>, an Iranian city about 30 miles east of the border. They were still in Dehloran on Thursday. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> took the initiative in the war in April, dislodging the Iranians from the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in that month, and from the Shalmcheh and oil-rich <LOCATION> Majnoon </LOCATION> islands in May and June. The Iranians now control a few scattered pockets in the central sector of the 730-mile warfront. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Moayeri </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy prime minister for foreign affairs, told <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio on Thursday: `` At present the enemy is fully mobilized against us. we should go to war more strongly.'' In <LOCATION> Manama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was escorting a Kuwaiti vessel in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> Thursday in the 47th convoy of 1988. The 46,723-ton liquefied gas carrier <PERSON> Gas </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> Wednesday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command announced in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The ship was among the first of 11 Kuwait-owned tankers re-registered under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag last July, entitling them to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> protection from Iranian attack. Soviet and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officials said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Thursday that the visit there by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s envoy <PERSON> Saadoun </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammadi </PERSON> failed to overcome Soviet opposition to an international arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` We do n't have any radical changes in our position,'' <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> told a government news briefing. <PERSON> Hammadi </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and a member of its <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters earlier that differences in views between his country and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> remained. In <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nazim </PERSON> <PERSON> Berker </PERSON> said two Turkish soldiers were killed by gunfire from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> while patrolling the border Wednesday. He said Thursday the attack took place near <LOCATION> Gelenler </LOCATION> village in <LOCATION> eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> province of Van, that <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to arrest the killers and that <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> may ask compensation in the deaths.

 A federal judge temporarily blocked the release of court documents in the massive probe of fraud in the defense industry Friday, saying he will decide in a week whether to overturn a magistrate's ruling that the media and the public have a right to see the documents. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> ordered attorneys for the news media, the government and other interested parties to submit papers and be prepared to present arguments July 22 at 2 p.m. PDT. Federal judges in three other jurisdictions _ <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> _ rejected other efforts Friday to unseal affidavits concerning the probe. The massive investigation, which became public last month, centers on allegations that defense industry consultants bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for information that helped contractors win multimillion-dollar contracts. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>'s decision blocked action on a ruling hours before by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> ordering release of sealed affidavits filed with warrants to search the offices of three <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> defense contractors and one defense consultant. <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON>'s ruling on a request by attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Copley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was immediately appealed by the government, bringing the case to <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said his office had been inundated with calls, many of them from people who claimed an interest in keeping the documents secret, and he said he wanted them to give them a chance to be heard. An attorney for one of those individuals appeared in the courtroom but refused to identify the person he represented. The lawyer, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, said he would tell the judge in a sealed document the identity of his client, but would n't tell anyone else. He said the person is an employee of one of the companies whose plants were searched. An attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said it was likely the issue would n't be resolved until it reaches the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. He urged <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> to move more swiftly so appeals could go forward, but the judge said he felt a week was a reasonable continuance. The government made one concession when it proposed releasing innocuous `` boilerplate'' sections of each search warrant such as its title and description of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who executed the warrant and of the premises searched. But <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> objected, and <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said he would review the `` boilerplate'' sections privately and rule Monday if they can be released. In his earlier ruling, <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> was adamant about the public's right to know `` Corruption, bribery, these are things that go to the heart of how our government functions,'' <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> said. `` We are talking about the foundations of our country, the defense of our country,'' <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> said in ruling that the public has the right to know through the news media about matters of such national importance. Defense consultant <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, said he wanted the affidavit released so he could represent his client properly. The warrants sought in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> were used June 13 to search the offices of <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>'s home. They were among 33 search warrants executed across the country that day. Affidavits attached to the warrants contain statements from investigators disclosing evidence they uncovered through court-ordered eavesdropping and detailing what they are seeking through their searches. In <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudd </PERSON> refused the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>'s request to unseal documents related to the search of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s offices in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Cudd </PERSON> ordered prosecutors to explain in writing why they wanted the documents kept secret, and set another hearing for Friday. In <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Korman </PERSON> ordered the unsealing of four search warrants, but kept the affidavits secret. He postponed opening the warrants until Wednesday to give the government time to appeal. <PERSON> Korman </PERSON>'s ruling was made on a motion filed by <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper headquartered on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The search warrants that <PERSON> Korman </PERSON> said could be made public include those used at the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> home of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a defense consultant who is a former vice president for the <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; the office of <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> employee at its <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, plant; the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenlawn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Kane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, which supplies paper products to aerospace companies. In <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, two federal judges refused to unseal affidavits used to search the office and home of former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, and the premises of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. Both men are defense consultants. Attorneys for <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> had sought access to the documents but were not seeking full public release. In a related development Friday, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its consulting contract with <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> has been terminated early `` by mutual agreement.'' `` It was decided under the present circumstances that Mr. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> did not have the time to devote to his contract,'' said <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Burch </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> had been a consultant to the company since shortly after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and had assisted `` with a wide range of our product lines, both military and commercial.'' <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> said he did n't know when <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s contract was due to expire. He refused to disclose how much <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> has paid <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>. After resigning his post as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for research, engineering and systems, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> became a consultant to several contractors, including <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>. A search warrant made public last week said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> suspected that <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> accepted bribes or gratuities from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and two other contractors while he was serving at the Pentagon. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> has also lost <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as a client as the corporation ended all contracts with defense consultants `` for the time being,'' <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> for a story in Saturday's editions. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckham </PERSON> said the consultants whose contracts were terminated included <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, an associate of <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> who also is under investigation in the defense probe. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> that disclosure of the detailed information in the affidavits would alert targets of the investigation and might encourage them to destroy documents. But <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> sided with attorney <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Heincke </PERSON>, representing the Times, who said the wide publicity of the defense fraud probe makes the sealing unnecessary because the investigation is no longer secret. <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> said few Americans read newspapers or care about the outcome of the defense probe, `` But this is about those few people who care and who keep this country on its toes.'' Citizens are entitled to ask, `` are we just throwing our money away when we buy these defense programs?'' he said. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> also contended that the First Amendment right of access applies only after a defendant has been arrested or indicted. No one has been charged in the defense procurement investigation. The only affidavit released in the case was unsealed earlier this month in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. But some of the less-detailed search warrants have been released.

 An explosion and fire at a <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> refinery killed one man and injured two Friday just hours after a flash fire in another part of the plant injured five other people, officials said. The two fires were not believed to be related, and both involved employees from private companies contracted by <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, said Fire Chief <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>. `` They were different companies, with different processes in different parts of the plant,'' said <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>. Shortly before 10 a.m., a flash fire injured five men from an outside contractor who were working on the refinery's sewage system, said <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>. Investigators believed sparks from a welder's torch ignited fumes rising from water that was mixed with volatile liquids, he said The second fire erupted about 3:20 p.m. and was quickly extinguished, but the blast left thousands of gallons of toxic hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals mixed with oil on the ground, said <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>. The dead man and the two men injured in the second fire are all employees of Benecia-based <ORGANIZATION> Calcat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. They were removing the residue from pipes containing a number of chemicals when the pipes exploded, said <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>. The reason for the blast was not immediately determined, he said. Of the seven workers injured in the two fires, four were hospitalized, one in critical condition. The dead man was identified as <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 30, no hometown available, <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> said. After the second fire, firefighters sprayed foam on the ground to control the spread of the spilt hydrogen peroxide, arsenic, oil, and other materials, but no evacuations were ordered, said <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>. In November, a huge blast at the refinery shattered windows throughout the area 15 miles south of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, sending a huge fireball into the air and sparking a blaze that burned for two days. One refinery worker suffered minor injuries.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Thursday that any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to resume military aid to Nicaraguan rebels would amount to `` newly legitimizing'' a war in which a truce was declared months ago. A source close to the rebels, known as Contras, said in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> that the leadership would meet this weekend in that nation's capital, <PERSON> Santo </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON>, to reorganize the movement. Leading foes of the leftist Sandinista government meanwhile vowed that their fight against the government's latest crackdown had just begun. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> spoke to journalists in <LOCATION> Campoa </LOCATION>, 58 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, where he inaugurated an agricultural fair. `` We hope they -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- do not commit this madness, since it would be newly legitimizing'' the civil war that began seven years ago, he said in remarks broadcast on the state radio, Voice of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> voted 385-18 on Thursday to condemn <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government for `` brutal suppression of basic human rights.'' A similar resolution passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by a 91-4 vote Wednesday night included the possibility of renewed military aid to the Contras if Sandinista policy did not change. The resolution would make democratic reform a condition of economic aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In their resolution, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members urged Central American leaders `` to convene immediately to assess the conditions in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> described in this resolution.'' They condemned the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> for arresting 43 demonstrators, including opposition leaders, and closing the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> radio station this week. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution was `` tremendously interventionist and illegal.'' `` We call this imperialism,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Orozco </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s press office said 31 anti-government demonstrators arrested Sunday were sentenced by police courts to six-month jail sentences for violating public security laws. Five demonstrators were sentenced similarly on Wednesday. Security forces violently broke up the demonstration Sunday in <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The source in <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> said more than 50 prominent Contras were expected to attend the weekend meeting, including <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, political head of the organization, and military coordinator <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. Internal disputes, notably between <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and the movement's political leaders, have divided the rebels in recent weeks The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said new leadership was expected to be chosen. `` This is a very hard dictatorship,'' <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, a critic of the government, said in an interview. He is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an opposition group. `` They can not stand the tremendous opposition that is gaining momentum,'' <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON> said. `` Everybody now knows they are Marxist-Leninists.'' On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> ordered <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven other American diplomats to leave the country. <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> left Tuesday and the others followed on Thursday. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ordered the same number of Nicaraguan diplomats out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government expropriated <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s largest and oldest sugar refinery on Wednesday, claiming it was not productive enough and the owners, the wealthy <PERSON> Pellas </PERSON> family, were not investing enough to keep it going. The century-old refinery is a leading symbol of Nicaraguan private enterprise. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellas </PERSON>, the refinery's general manager, told reporters Thursday the expropriation was `` a very hard blow for the economy.'' He said the related <PERSON> Flor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cana </PERSON> rum distillery, known throughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, was legally separate from the refinery and not affected by the expropriation. The crackdown reverses an easing of restrictions on the opposition that began in November as part of a Central American peace plan approved in August 1987 by the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Under the plan, the Sandinistas and rebels reached a cease-fire agreement March 21 that has survived occasional violations. Negotiations on a permanent truce are deadlocked.

<TEXT>
 `` A merry war'' is the way one character describes the relationship between <PERSON> Benedick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, those tempest-tossed, tart-tongued lovers in `` Much Ado About Nothing.'' That's pretty much the way it's played in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> where the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Shakespeare Festival opened its boisterous revival of one of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s most durable comedies on Thursday night. Director <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> opts for the robust rather than the romantic in his staging of the play, an approach that accentuates the laughs rather than the poetry. Fortunately, he gets both from <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, who probably could walk on water if asked to do so by his director. <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> does just about everything else in `` Much Ado,'' and he accomplishes it with such style, wit and grace that he gives hamminess a good name. The actor makes a first-rate arrogant, foolish and finally lovestruck <PERSON> Benedick </PERSON>. Consider <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>'s entrance in the play. It's no quiet walk-on. It's a full-fledged sword fight, staged with an alarming athleticism by fight director B.H. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. In the middle of this ruckus, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> sits quietly and reads a book. The battle lines are drawn as soon as the play begins. If <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> <PERSON> Danner </PERSON>, who appears as the equally obstinate and egocentric <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, ca n't match the <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> juggernaut, she gives it a good try. Her Beatrice is too much of a lady, and her odd, almost squeaky voice is not particularly suited for <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>. Still, she exudes an impertinence that mangages to charm <PERSON> Benedick </PERSON> and the audience by the end of the evening. A special joy of <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>'s production is the strong supporting cast which usually fades into the background. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> makes a comical yet touching <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON>, the nobleman who instigates the matching up of <PERSON> Benedick </PERSON> with <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> with Hero. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, the melancholy villain of the play, is a strange character. He sets in motion a subplot to besmirch Hero's honor and then disappears. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> does a fine comic turn _ all smirks and sneers _ and remains in one's memory even after he leaves the stage. There is more good support from <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerringer </PERSON> as <PERSON> Leonato </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s uncle, another of those underrated roles, and from <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiller </PERSON> as the dumbest of Dogberrys. Because <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benedick </PERSON> are so strong, the actors playing the other set of lovers tend to disappear into the plot. That's the case with <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, a colorless <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cates </PERSON>, a one-dimensional Hero. Designer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON> has provided a fairy tale 19th century Italian town, which is where <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> sets the play. The costumes by <PERSON> Theoni </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldredge </PERSON> are colorful and apppropriate to the period. There is an inevitable falloff after the exuberant first act. But that's because the ending has been telegraphed long before the play is over and the involved plot convolutions must be straightened out before the curtain falls. Still this `` Much Ado About Nothing'' spins gaily for much of the evening and most of it turns because of the whirlwind performance of <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>. He makes it the airiest, most bouyant production in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Tiny Cracks Found In Nearly Half Of Inspected Boeing 737s</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tiny cracks were found in nearly half the aging <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 jetliners known to have been inspected since the top ripped off an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 737 in late May, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> official testified Thursday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, manager of the airframe branch in the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> aircraft certification office, described the initial responses to an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> `` airworthiness directive'' in testimony to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing on the accident The order, issued within a week after the April 28 accident, required all <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s with 30,000 or more landings to undergo a special visual inspection of fuselage lap joints, or areas where parts of the fuselage are bonded and riveted together. The directive ordered those with more than 50,000 landings to have additional inspections using high-frequency electronic equipment. Airlines were required to fix any problems found and to report the results to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. A flight attendant was killed and 61 persons injured when a portion of the fuselage on a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 peeled off during an <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> flight from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, exposing the first-class section to the open air at 24,000 feet. The pilot and co-pilot managed to land the crippled jet 13 minutes later in <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> although one of the two engines quit. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said 291 737s were affected by the inspection order issued shortly after the accident. As of this week, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has received reports on 100 planes, of which 49 reported cracks. The largest crack found was about one-half inch, but most were three-eighths of an inch or smaller, he said. The most found in one plane were 31 cracks within a 40-inch space. Five or more cracks were found in 14 of the planes, he said. Cracks can occur around the rivets used to join the panels. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said none of the cracks reported had joined up _ `` In other words, they had not gone from fastener to fastener.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> declined comment on the cracks until he had spoken with the airlplane manufacturer's engineers. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashworth </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> aircraft certification division, said he was concerned about the cracks but saw no imminent danger to the planes or to air passengers. As of today `` we have not seen evidence of impending failure in any airplane. We of course are requiring that all cracks we finds be repaired. That's only prudent maintenance,'' he said. In testimony earlier Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldani </PERSON> said he was shocked to learn in an October 1987 meeting with <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> officials that the airline did not have a specific program to prevent corrosion of its air fleet. <PERSON> Oldani </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Arii </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON>'s staff vice president of quality control and engineering, told him that <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> had stopped its corrosion control program three years earlier. Much of the testimony at the hearing has focused on technical studies of how cracks form in 737s. The inquiry is trying to determine the cause of the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident, but early investigations have focused on possible structural failure, perhaps aggravated by corrosion. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> told the panel that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> was formulating `` very demanding'' new rules to require extensive inspections of early 737s.

 Insurance problems will delay a plan aimed at reducing the spread of AIDS by distributing free needles to intravenous drug users, a social service agency official said Thursday. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, executive director of the agency Outside In, said her organization hopes to begin giving out the hypodermic needles by late August. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said the insurance company, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, is concerned about the agency's liability because the project, which was scheduled to begin this month, is unprecedented in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It is difficult to assess the exposure and risk, and therefore it's difficult to determine rates,'' she said. <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, said the company notified Outside In that the project was n't covered under its existing policy. `` It takes us into areas of unknown liability,'' she said. `` We're especially concerned for the potential of the spread of AIDS from needles supplied by the clinic and later re-used.'' Under the yearlong project, 125 drug abusers will exchange used needles for new ones and receive counseling. The project is financed by a $ 67,000 grant from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for AIDS Research. If the insurance cost increases greatly, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said, she is confident that more funds can be obtained because of the interest in the experiment nationwide. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, the largest medical liability insurer in the country, has provided comprehensive medical malpractice and liability insurance to Outside In for 10 years. The agency never has had a claim filed against its policy. `` We're negotiating with them to work this out,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. `` They've been insured with our company for several years and it's important for us to work it out with them. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said the company's action came as a surprise because the problems did n't surface when agency officials spoke with the insurance company about the proposed project a year ago and again when the financing was obtained earlier this year. She said the company apparently became concerned after news accounts of the project were published. Outside In learned about the problem about two weeks ago, she said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most often spread through sexual contact, sharing of needles by intravenous drug abusers, or by transfusions of blood or blood products, experts say.

 Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June, the government said Friday, but analysts saw cause for worry in the steep, drought-induced climb in raw food prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the hot, dry weather searing much of the nation sent prices of unprocessed grain and poultry soaring by more than 20 percent last month, pushing raw food prices 4.2 percent higher than in May. It was the biggest jump since October 1985. Food prices rose a lower, but still substantial, 1.1 percent at the wholesale level, one step before retail stores. Economists said that it was only a matter of time before price bulges at earlier production stages show up on supermarket shelves.

The May deficit was actually $ 627 million higher than a revised April imbalance of $ 10.3 billion. But the April figure was the smallest imbalance since a $ 9.9 billion deficit in August 1985 and the May deficit was the second smallest imbalance since that time.

 Despite an estimated 60,700 deaths in the workplace each year, the federal government is failing to aggressively prosecute companies that violate safety laws and endanger workers, a study concludes.

<HEAD>Cemetery Yields Skeletons From Argentina's `Dirty War'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDALL HACKLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AVELLANEDA, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eleven of the skeletons each had a bullet hole in the skull, some with mouths agape as if in a shriek. A few still had on shreds of the clothing they wore in their last living moment. In a walled-off, tennis-court-sized section of <ORGANIZATION> Avellaneda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> is a burial ground that authorities believe contains the remains of 200 to 300 victims of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s `` dirty war'' of the 1970s, when a military dictatorship ruled <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The mass gravesite in this industrial city of 650,000 southeast of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> is the largest so far found of those believed slain by 1970s security forces hunting down `` subversives.'' Each weekday, six young forensic anthropologists unearth more bones in an attempt to document what happened to those victims, 95 percent of whom bear evidence of having been shot in the head from short-range at the peak of the repression in 1976-78. `` Most of the victims are of our own generation,'' said the team's leader, 30-year-old <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidball </PERSON> <PERSON> Binz </PERSON>. `` We even found the remains of one woman who was 76. It's hard to figure out who she was a threat to.'' The four men and two women of the <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthropology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> have uncovered 83 victims in the four years they've been working together. Through identifications of 20 of those victims, three military officers have been convicted of homicide or kidnapping. A government panel created by President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> identified 8,961 people who died during those years, although human rights groups say the number who were abducted, vanished and now are presumed dead is about 20,000. Building legal cases against the killers is one of the goals of the team. Another is documenting what happened in those bloody years when scores of suspected leftists _ data shows half were laborers or students _ `` disappeared,'' most at night, and most from their own homes. Most were taken by security men to one of the 340 detention centers for questioning; many were tortured, often fatally. Evidence indicates some were dumped from airplanes into the River Plate estuary. Others were tossed in unmarked graves that came to be called `` NN,'' or no-name graves. `` It's not pretty,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fondebrider </PERSON>, at 24 the youngest member of the team. `` We're trying to piece together what happened for history's sake so that hopefully it will never occur again.'' The team has no government funding, a surprise considering that <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, a civilian who took over the presidency after the military stepped down, is a human rights activist who ordered trials that convicted five military junta leaders, including two ex-presidents. The team receives $ 48,000 in funding from the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Mitterrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of Churches. Its members take public transportation to work and share office space with a human rights group in an old three-story building near downtown <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. The team began in 1984 when <PERSON> Tidball </PERSON> <PERSON> Binz </PERSON>, then a medical student, was recruited by the renowned forensic anthropologist Clyde Snow of <LOCATION> Norman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, to help the newly restored democracy identify the remains of some dirty-war victims. Five of <PERSON> Tidball </PERSON> <PERSON> Binz </PERSON>'s companions joined the team. Its work involves meticulously excavating a skeleton, measuring bones, making X-rays, examining dental records and comparing every bit to information from the medical charts of the missing. Their findings are entered into a computer. Finding one that matches dental records often horrifies the victim's relatives. `` It is still very, very traumatic for the families of the victims. Some even continue denying it -LRB- the body -RRB- is who it is despite the proof,'' <PERSON> Tidball </PERSON> <PERSON> Binz </PERSON> said. What's found in the graves, which Snow calls `` a time capsule that preserves proof of the identity and cause of death,'' have proven damning to those who contended the victims died in gunfights with security forces. In nearly every case uncovered by the team, evidence showed they had been slain with a shot to the base of the skull from about three feet away. In many cases, fragments of bullets from standard police-issue shotguns were found in the skull, <PERSON> Tidball </PERSON> <PERSON> Binz </PERSON> said. A few cases showed victims were pregnant or recently gave birth. Some burial plots contained groupings of chopped-off hands.

<HEAD>New Production of ``Ring'' Cycle Highlights Beyreuth Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAYREUTH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mix an experimental director from communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s legendary operas, and you come up with one of the most eagerly awaited <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> seasons in years. A new production of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s epic `` Ring'' cycle under East German director <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON> and celebrated <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> conductor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON>, will be the centerpiece of <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Richard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wagner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, which opens on July 26. `` From <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON> one can expect a modern, perhaps even socially critical production,'' critic <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Frankfurter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allegemeine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said in an interview. `` The story of the family tragedy and its elements of greed, particularly in ` Die Walkuere,' lends itself well to a socially critical interpretation.'' The new `` Ring'' production is clearly the highlight of the season. Previous festival `` Ring'' productions have set the old Germanic myths in various time periods, and in styles ranging from bombastic to relatively spare and modern. The festival, first held in 1876, transforms the placid northern Bavarian town of <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> for one month every summer into a gathering place for <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> lovers across the world. For nearly 40 years, <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, the composer's grandson, has been running the festival, occasionally also producing festival performances. Performances regularly sell out way ahead of time, as there are only 1,925 seats available in the theater <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> built specifically for his works. The theater was financed by <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, nicknamed `` Mad King <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON>'' because of his extreme shyness and love of overspending on elaborate, Disneyland-like castles. According to <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, a spokesman for the festival, this year was no exception to the festival's sell-out tradition. `` Demand for the festival was greater this year than ever,'' he said. `` Tickets sold out shortly after going on sale last November.'' The festival will open with the return of last year's `` Parsifal,'' directed by <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> and conducted by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> `` My favorite opera is ` Parsifal' and that's why I'm really looking forward to going,'' said <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> fan <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuldt </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schuldt </PERSON> has been making the annual trek to <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> for the last 10 years. `` But it's the new ` Ring' production that's causing the most excitement,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> has a special style. You really notice when he's conducting.'' <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON>, musical director of the renowned <ORGANIZATION> Orchestre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION>, will conduct the four works comprising the mighty `` Der Ring des <PERSON> Nibelungen </PERSON>'' cycle to begin on July 27 with `` Das Rheingold.'' The other works, `` Die Walkuere,'' `` Siegfried'' and `` Goetterdaemmerung'' will follow. Opera lovers also say they are eager to see what East German director <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON> does with the new `` Ring'' production. `` That's the sensation of the season to me,'' <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Everding </PERSON>, general director of the Bayerischen Staatstheater -LRB- Bavarian State Theater -RRB- said. `` <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON> is a wonderful opera director.'' Critic <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> looked to <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON>'s 1978 <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> production of `` The Flying Dutchman'' as a clue to what audiences might expect this summer. `` It was highly imaginative, but critical at the same time,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON> manages to bring current aspects into his work, and audiences today can easily identify with it.'' Other festival presentations will be a return of last year's romantic opera, `` Lohengrin'' and `` Die Meistersinger von <LOCATION> Nuernberg </LOCATION>. Opera singers in this year's festival include some of <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> favorites such as <LOCATION> Siegfried </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as Parsifal and <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazura </PERSON> as Klingsor and the Wanderer, and <PERSON> Waltraud </PERSON> <PERSON> Meier </PERSON> as <PERSON> Kundry </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Waltraute </LOCATION>. Among those appearing in <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> for the first time include <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Opie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marie-Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reirdan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. There will be a total of 30 performances at the festival, which runs until Aug. 29. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> tourist officials laugh at some aspects of the summer invasion. `` We get people writing letters to the mayor asking for tickets,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bayreuth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said. `` And lots of tourists just stumble in here casually and are astounded when they ca n't get tickets.'' <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION>, a picturesque town founded in the 12th century, also shows a number of art exhibits during the <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> festival, much of them <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> related.

 Democrats assemble this week to give <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a southern-style send-off in his race for the White House and they can only hope that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a born scene-stealer, will decide to play a supporting role. From Monday night's warbling rendition of the Star Spangled Banner by radio personality <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> to Thursday night's acceptance speeches by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has spent many months and many millions on a program to boost its chances of winning the White House <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> marches into Dixie on Sunday as the unquestioned nominee of his party. He has more than enough delegates to crush any attempt by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to alter the bare bones platform he decreed, and more than enough clout to make sure the convention ratifies his choice of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as running mate. But it will be up to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has the allegiance of roughly one quarter of the convention's 4,210 delegates, to decide how unified and harmonious a front the party presents to the four-night prime time audience. As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' last remaining rival for the nomination, he has promised repeatedly to support the Democratic ticket this fall. But he angrily broke off platform negotiations with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last week after learning of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s selection from a reporter rather than from the governor himself. Whatever <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> decides _ whether he contests the platform, tries to challenge <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s spot on the ticket or leaves the Omni to lead the thousands of supporters who say they will be in the streets _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englander </LOCATION> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' nomination will be spiced with a southern flavor. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will preside as chairman and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> State Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> will deliver the keynote address that is the highlight of Monday night's opening session. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> will place <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' name in nomination on Tuesday night in another bow to a region of the country that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> used to win regularly in presidential elections, but now seems largely out of reach. On the first night, the assembled Democrats also will hear from former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a native Georgian who once served as governor. Tuesday night's program is expected to begin with the platform and end with a speech by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, with appearances by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and other party leaders in between. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s forces have prepared several minority planks to the platform, and while a vote on some or all is possible, the differences also may be ironed out in advance. Delegates will see a video presentation about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, to be introduced by his children. The party picks its nominee on Wednesday, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> the only names entered into nomination. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will be picked for vice president on Thursday _ with or without a fight by the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces _ and then he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will deliver their acceptance speeches. Party officials say that anyone interested in challenging <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s nomination must submit a petition with between 300 and 600 delegate signatures by Thursday morning. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has more than enough supporters in the hall to accomplish that, if he wants. Whatever else happens, there will be the usual street demonstrations outside the hall. Rumors circulated that the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> would stage a demonstration, and party spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said Democratic officials are concerned about the threat of violence. `` That does concern the party ... we're well prepared to deal with any situation that arises,'' he said. Republicans have set up a beachhead in the Democrats' host city, and have arranged for several prominent officials to take pot shots each day at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. The host city was busy sprucing itself up for its four days in the glare of nationwide publicity. Municipal workers placed planters with vibrantly colored flowers along the streets near the convention hall. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign volunteers decorated the city with political posters, and workers in the downtown hotels polished and repolished every available surface in anticipation of the arrival of the delegates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> goes into the convention with a modest lead over <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the public opinion polls, and he and his high command hope to use the week to pad the margin. In appearances inside the convention hall and out, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor will follow a schedule designed to stress the themes that secured him the Democratic nomination and that he intends to repeat in the fall. Rather than spend his time speaking only to party delegate caucuses, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is expected to spend part of his day campaigning away from the hall and the glass and steel downtown hotels that house many of the delegates. A trip to a factory gate is a possibility, to dramatize his support for the plant closing law that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is sending to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk. He may also visit a school to emphasize his opposition to drugs. Aside from the prime time appearances on network television _ including the morning shows on Monday and his acceptance speech on Thursday _ he is expected to make himself available for television interviews by satellite with stations around the country. Aides say he will stress his commitment to creating jobs and his support for health care and education, and sound the theme of ethics in government. He and other speakers are expected to stress <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ethnic roots, and the governor will be introduced to the convention and the television audience on Thursday night by his cousin, Oscar-winning actress <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' nomination will mark the end of a marathon run for the party's top prize. He began the campaign as merely one of `` seven dwarfs'' seeking the nomination. Just as methodically as he raised millions of campaign dollars, he methodically dispatched one rival after another in the early primaries and caucuses. By the time <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> held its primary in mid-April, the race had been narrowed to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and there was never any doubt about which of them would win.

 When Eskimo leaders gathered in this <LOCATION> Kuskokwim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> village four years ago to create the Yupiit Nation, they paused for a day of fishing. `` There's always time for fishing,'' said <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasayulie </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Yupiit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> and chief executive officer of <PERSON> Akiachak </PERSON>'s tribal council. `` People's lives here revolve around the river.'' In southwestern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, fishing for the salmon that migrate upstream each summer is no recreational pursuit. The fish are a major source of income and food for <PERSON> Akiachak </PERSON> and dozens of other native villages along the winding ribbon of muddy water. The <LOCATION> Kuskokwim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is the only highway into town. Few villagers own a car, but nearly every household has a boat. <PERSON> Kasayulie </PERSON>, 37, figures he spends at least 45 days a year on the river. Part of the time he's catching salmon for sale under his limited-entry commercial permit. The rest of the time he's fishing for personal use. He and his extended family of 16 catch up to 500 salmon a year in driftnets strung from open riverboats. They eat most of the fish themselves; the rest is shared with village elders who ca n't get out to fish anymore. They cut up, dry and smoke the salmon on wooden racks at `` fish camps'' up and down the <LOCATION> Kuskokwim </LOCATION>. A few fish are saved for `` stinkhead,'' an Eskimo treat made by burying a salmon head in the sand. They leave the head to ferment for 10 days or so, then dig it up, wash off the sand and eat it. `` They call it stinkhead because it stinks,'' <PERSON> Kasayulie </PERSON> said. `` I really like it.'' August brings a brief respite from the river, when <PERSON> Kasayulie </PERSON> takes the family camping for two or three days to pick about 30 gallons of blueberries, salmonberries and cranberries. But in the fall, he's back in his boat, heading up river to hunt moose. And in the winter, when the river freezes solid, the fishing begins all over again, as villagers chop holes through the ice to fish for burbot, whitefish and pike.

 In a city where bank closings have become so common they fail to attract much notice, officials of <ORGANIZATION> Fondren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> did something that was extraordinary but made no headlines. They built a $ 900,000 bank building and opened it in June. `` Obviously if we did n't feel things were moving positively, we would n't have done it,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, the bank's president. `` We think things are better. We know they are.'' <ORGANIZATION> Fondren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION>, with assets of about $ 37 million, is far from the largest bank in town, but the confidence officials are showing in the city mirrors other signs that make some believe the economic nightmare that followed the energy crash of the early 1980s is slowly ending. When the oil bust hit, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> was left with the image of a city of empty skyscrapers, unprecedented unemployment, banking chaos and more recently, highly publicized bankruptcies involving prominent Texans like former Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connally </PERSON> and surgeon <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON>. But even <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bond rating firms are nodding cautiously that the worst may be over for <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, which in the past decade used the energy boom to push past <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelpia </LOCATION> and become the nation's fourth-largest city. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, swayed by optimistic pleas from top <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> officials, kept the city's bond rating at the more favorable `` Aa'' category. `` We looked at the relationship of the city's attempt to balance the current budget and finish the year in a positive mode,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> vice president. `` Their perceptions of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> were wrong,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabry </PERSON>, spokesman for Mayor <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>, explaining why <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s officials changed their minds What <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s officials were told is that Mrs. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> will resolve an unexpected budget deficit with a recently approved 18.9 percent tax increase. And they were delivered a rosy picture of a city on its way back. For example, unemployment, at nearly 13 percent in June 1987, most recently was reported at 7.1 percent. In the 12 months ending in May, employment rose by 28,000. In May alone, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Employment Commission figures showed the total number of people working rose by 15,000 to 1,495,100. Figures also show the city expects at least 20,000 new jobs this year with economic growth up 2 percent and expanding in subsequent years. City officials also are touting <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s depressed housing market as a plus for people moving in, noting that home costs and apartment rents are among the lowest of major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. For example, a 2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom house that sell for $ 250,000 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> goes for a mere $ 80,000 in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who heads the university of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s economics department, is forecasting home prices will jump 10 percent next year and continue to climb in the early 1990s. Elsewhere, shipments through the Port of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> were 30.2 million tons through April, up 15 percent from the previous year. At the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, construction worth $ 1.5 billion is ensuring the complex remains the world's largest medical center. And <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported it installed more new phone lines in April than any month in nearly three years. At federal bankruptcy court, where clerks were so busy at one point that they refused to answer the telephone, the number of filings has leveled off, according to a Price Waterhouse survey. Although the court received 429 petitions in the first quarter of the year _ up 3 percent from the previous quarter _ the number was 8 percent below the peak third quarter of 1986 and close to the average 422 recorded over the past year. `` While the overall number of business bankruptcies increased slightly during the first quarter, various sectors of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s economy showed signs of improvement,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of Price Waterhouse `` Several companies have announced relocation plans moving them to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. ... With low real estate and wage costs, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> continues to be an attractive market for corporate relocations.'' One of them is <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which recently broke ground for a $ 50 million space headquarters that is projected to add hundreds of jobs. Even <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>'s legendary traffic problems appear to be easing, with freeway renovation and construction feverish. The first phase of a long-awaited county toll road project was completed in late June with hopes it will unclog two major freeways to the city's northern reaches On the minus side, however, are new home sales, which trail anemic year-ago figures by 4 percent. For the first quarter of 1988, the 1,520 permits issued for single-family homes was down 22 percent from the same 1987 period. `` The general consensus, from the people we've talked to, is that <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> is probably at the bottom now,'' according to <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, editor of the trade publication <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Housing Markets. And the energy business, spoiled when oil prices exceeded $ 30 per barrel and knocked nearly comatose when prices slipped beneath $ 10, is learning the realities of coping with $ 16-18 oil. A survey of the city's 50 largest public companies by the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> shows 20 lost money in 1987, and 12 of those 20 losers are energy-related firms. But a forecast by the <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> says favorable trends in the energy business should continue through 1990, with higher prices leading to more significant recovery. `` For <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s recovery to expand, conditions in the energy industry must at least remain stable,'' said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Foss </PERSON>, senior associate at the center. Still, <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> economists believe that even if oil prices soften, the city's employment should not be affected greatly. `` <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s economic recovery continues and may even be picking up speed,'' the economists said. At <ORGANIZATION> Fondren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, employees and customers are glad to be in the gleaming new building and out of the mobile home that served as the bank's temporary quarters. `` We have lots of small - to medium-size businesses that are customers,'' bank president <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said `` It's pretty much across-the-board and not just in our minds. It's reflected in those businesses. Things are better almost everywhere.''

 Banks have raised their prime lending rate to 9.5 percent from 9 percent, pushing the benchmark interest rate to the highest level in more than two years. Thursday's increase reflected a rise in the banks' own borrowing costs and signaled more expensive loans for consumers and businesses. It marked the second time this year the nation's banks have raised the prime, which is used to calculate a range of fixed and adjustable-rate corporate and consumer loans.

 It is no accident that many department stores put their cosmetics counters just inside the front door, the area with the highest customer traffic. When <PERSON> Bloomingdale </PERSON>'s redid the first floor of its flagship <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> store a few years ago, the centerpiece was the makeup and perfume department. It also is no accident that the front pages of women's magazines often are dominated by ads for <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Estee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Clairol </ORGANIZATION>, Coty and other big names in beauty, while inside, articles dispense tips on how women can totally make themselves over. Cosmetics is a big and lucrative business, bringing in $ 17 billion in sales last year. The world's largest cosmetic company, <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had 1987 sales of nearly $ 1.81 billion from its cosmetics, fragrances and toiletries business. That produced a $ 251.3 million pre-tax profit. Numbers like that make successful cosmetic companies desirable properties. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> battled for three months in 1985 before finally winning a $ 1.65 billion takeover fight for <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's top cosmetic manufacturers. The profitable business lately has come under scrutiny by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, too. The House small business panel on Wednesday held a hearing to examine health and safety questions about cosmetics, some of which are said to contain chemicals that could cause cancer, birth defects, central nervous disorders, skin and eye irritations and allergic reactions. Cosmetics are profitable because they are relatively inexpensive to produce and their prices can be marked up heavily because of snob appeal. The cosmetic industry has its own equivalent of designer fashions. For example, a mascara by <ORGANIZATION> Maybelline </ORGANIZATION> was priced at $ 3 in a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> drug store, while a similar Estee Lauder product sold for $ 10 at <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION>. Manufacturers and retailers both are big beneficiaries of makeup's high profit margins. `` If you pay $ 10 for an item, the manufacturer probably gets $ 6,'' leaving $ 4 for the retailer, said <ORGANIZATION> Diana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, a cosmetic industry analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. One reason why retailers do so well from makeup is that at bigger department and specialty stores, such as <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Nordstrom </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, the people selling the cosmetics often are paid at least in part by the manufacturer, Ms. <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> said In shopping for cosmetics, women generally are motivated by price and the image created for the product by ad campaigns. But if you put the Maybelline mascara and the <PERSON> Estee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> item side by side, is there any difference between the ingredients of the two? `` Not a heck of a lot,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` There are differences in quality but the differences in price are greater,'' Ms. <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> said. Cosmetics sell because they can make women more glamorous. But they also have given the people associated with the industry their own special aura. The late <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Revson </PERSON>, one of the founders of <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION>, was constantly in the society pages. And actress <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> made it into the movies after her impeccably made-up face appeared in many a <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> ad.

 You can quit cringing at the first sight of those long-distance telephone commercials: telephone admakers plan to lighten up. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T is winding down its use of ads that show corporate underlings getting chewed out by the boss _ or worrying that they might be fired _ for picking the wrong telephone service. Instead, it is phasing in new ads that show its employees describing how they can help your business. Competitor <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, plans to begin using a new series of ads next week that indirectly pokes fun at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's old approach as it humorously demonstrates how important it is to get a clear line when you want to place a business call. The ads were directed by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedelmaier </PERSON>, best known for his `` Where's the Beef'' ads for <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s and his fast-talker spots for <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. In one new Sprint ad, four men are in an office waiting for the boss's call. `` That's him,'' they say as the phone rings. But as the camera catches every expressive twitch of the face of the guy who picks up the phone, the boss' instructions are reduced to gibberish because of the poor quality of the phone line. `` Listen carefully.. 500 cases.. by Monday ... we'll lose the account'' are some of the fragments that can be After the boss hangs up, the man who took the call dutifully repeats for the others exactly what he heard. The message is that this wo n't happen if you use Sprint. But there is no suggestion that somebody is about to lose his job over it. Sprint executives and their admakers at <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said they felt the ads coming from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and, to a lesser extent, from <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were `` depressing and colorless.'' `` We wanted to be upbeat. We wanted to be fiesty, and we wanted to poke fun at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T who lately have been taking themselves too seriously,'' said <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carniglia </PERSON>, the Sprint account director for <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, has been using a series of ads that show no-nonsense business types who describe a wide range of <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> services that they say helps businesses operate more efficiently and at lower cost. In one ad, an <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> technical supervisor looks wistfully out his office window and says, `` Maybe some day we'll work 9 to 5. At least that's what I tell my wife.'' In another ad, a comptroller snaps, `` I want to know where every dollar is going,'' and adds that <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s billing itemizes every call. But the Sprint admakers also wanted to be noticed, and felt <PERSON> Sedelmaier </PERSON>'s deft touch for making people smile could help them do that. Sprint, a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, is running behind <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> in the estimated $ 50 billion a year long-distance market. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Grubman </PERSON>, telecommunications analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>, estimates <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has about 72-73 percent of the intercity long-distance market, while <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> had about 10 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> about 7 percent. The companies refuse to say how much they spend on advertising. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T district manager in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the company knew that the grim ads it put on the air last winter would make some people uneasy, but believed they would get the attention of decisionmakers in small - and medium-size businesses He said the plan always had been to run the first wave of ads for about six months, and then phase them out by the fall as a second wave of ads rolled out that featured bright <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T employees talking about what the company offers. `` The plan was to get people's attention.

<TEXT>
 A court-ordered rematch of the proxy fight beween <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> would be unprecedented and would strengthen the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> partnership's attempt to control the personal care giant, according to industry analysts. A federal judge said Wednesday he was inclined to order a new proxy vote in the six-month battle because <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> misled stockholders about <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> before the election. Analysts said institutional investors, seeking a quick profit from the personal care giant, probably own more <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock than before the April vote and would be more likely to back <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s dissident slate of board candidates <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> controls about 5.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s common shares outstanding. The partnership wants to win board seats to pressure the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> board to sell the company, which <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> believes would boost the value of its stock. `` I think it's safe to assume that there are more arbitragers holding <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> today than back in March,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Upham </PERSON>. `` I think that <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> is definitely viewed as a speculative plot.'' Judges in the past have ordered new proxy votes, but that typically has been in cases involving huge vote discrepancies where a new vote was deemed irrelevant. The <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> case is rarer because it involves information a judge determined could have affected the outcome. `` The court found that there was something misleading,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, a partner with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm <ORGANIZATION> Weil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gotschal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Manges. `` This does n't happen very often. Usually when you have a challenge it's a challenge to the tally.'' In the April 21 election, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s 27,000 shareholders rejected <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s slate of four candidates to the board by 52 percent to 48 percent proportion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said at Wednesday's hearing that he was inclined to order a new election because `` the essence of the election was tainted in a material way.'' Last week, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> ruled <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> misled stockholders about <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> in newspaper advertisements leading up to the proxy vote. He also said a failure by Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> to disclose a series of standstill agreements with potential suitors was not misleading and would not have affected the election. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> scheduled a trial the week of Aug. 22 on <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s charges that <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose the limited partners in RB Partners, a <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> company formed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock. The judge said Wednesday that regardless of his ruling in the second phase of the case, he is likely to order the new vote. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> has asked for a new election of eight directors in the fall, pre-empting <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s normal spring meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said stockholders would consider the standstill agreements _ under which 10 companies agreed not to attempt to buy <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> for two years ending in November _ if <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> orders a new election. `` I think there's a totally new mix of information available to stockholders,'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. `` We'll just have to see next time around whether that's enough to change things.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> in April, alleging the securities law violations. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm responded with its claim of misrepresentation. The counterclaim was heard in court first because Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>, then handling the case, felt that if <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> lost its challenge to the proxy vote then <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s case would be moot. `` The judge indicated he was still evolving his thinking and he has n't come up with a remedy yet,'' <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fausch </PERSON> said. `` One of the remedies that is possible is a new election. Let's take that at face value.''

 Uncertainty over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures due out later in the day kept the dollar within a narrow range in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today and held down stock prices, traders said. `` Everyone was cautious about taking a direction with the dollar because of the upcoming trade figures,'' said <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugiyama </PERSON> of the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` People are unsure what kind of figures to expect. As a result, the dollar could go either way next week.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for May were to be announced later today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Traders said the dollar's overnight gain in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, reflecting higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, helped boost the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to 133.37 yen, up 0.42 yen from Thursday's close The dollar then stayed within a narrow range throughout the day, ending the week at 133.40 yen, up 0.45 yen from Thursday's final figure. Spot volume was estimated at $ 5.9 billion. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average first rose, then dropped as participants took to the sidelines to await the trade figures, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> said. `` With little demand for new purchases, prices began falling almost across the board,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Nikkei index, which gained 63.98 points Thursday, lost 170.29 points or 0.6 percent, closing at 27,913.79. Volume on the market's first section was estimated at a light 2 billion shares, down slightly from Thursday's 2.2 billion shares.

<HEAD>Farmers Welcomes Oregon Rejection Of Hostile Takeover Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says a hostile takeover attempt of the company by a British conglomerate should be dropped following the rejection of the plan by <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s insurance commissioner. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky.-based subsidiary of the British B.A.T. <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, has offered $ 4.5 billion for the Los Angeles-based Farmers. Farmers directors rejected the proposal. Oregon Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulongoski </PERSON> concluded on Thursday that the proposed buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> would adversely affect Farmers' policyholders and competition in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s insurance trade. <PERSON> Kulongoski </PERSON> cited the intention of <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, which owns a major tobacco company, to restrict the non-smoker policies sold by Farmers. `` Director <PERSON> Kulongoski </PERSON>'s decision on this matter confirms our belief that this proposed transaction would ultimately be detrimental to Farmers and its <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> policyholders,'' said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, Farmers' chairman. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it was `` completely astonished'' by the decision. `` A cursory reading of the decision strongly suggests that the commissioner has reached conclusions that are contrary to law and appear to be unsupported by the record and the facts,'' a spokesman said. <PERSON> Kulongoski </PERSON>'s order can be appealed to the courts. The takeover bid as now structured would require approval of insurance regulators in nine states. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s insurance commissioner also has rejected the proposal, and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> has approved it. `` Following the recent decision by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>, this is a second very significant setback to <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>' unwanted hostile takeover attempt,'' <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> said `` We believe that <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> will face further regulatory difficulties in current and pending reviews by other state insurance departments.'' <PERSON> Kulongoski </PERSON>, citing his role as hearings officer in the case, made only limited remarks outside his statements in the order. He said the case is unique in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> insurance history because it does not involve a troubled insurer being acquired by a more financially sound company. `` Rather, it is the proposed acquisition of a very well-managed company by a larger company seeking to diversify into the financial services market in this country,'' <PERSON> Kulongoski </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>' statement also took issue with <PERSON> Kulongoski </PERSON>'s characterization of Farmers as well-managed The `` statement to the effect that this is not a financially distressed company, but rather a well-managed one being acquired by a larger company seeking to diversify, suggests that the decision is anti-takeover, rather than protection for the policyholders,'' the statement said. The commissioner in his ruling said the proposed acquisition `` subjects policyholders and shareholders to substantial risks while providing no benefit that Farmers does not already enjoy.'' He also said the continued denials by B.A.T. and <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> `` of the known adverse health effects of tobacco smoking, and its stated intentions of precluding Farmers from referring to such health effects in its marketing literature, do not promote the interest of the insurance-buying public.'' <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> along with retail concerns including <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>'s.

<TEXT>
 The dollar rose strongly today after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government reported that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit widened to $ 10.9 billion in May, less than expected. Gold prices fell in morning trading. The dollar rose almost one cent against the British pound and nearly one Japanese yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported the second smallest deficit in almost three years. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency also surged higher in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading. The markets had been predicting a deficit of around $ 11 billion after a deficit of $ 9.9 billion in April. The dollar had moved higher in calm European trading in advance of the report. Foreign exchange dealers said that although market turnover was somewhat subdued ahead of the announcement, the currency was buoyed by optimism over the trade deficit. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.6730 to buy one pound after the report, cheaper than $ 1.6820 at midmorning and $ 1.6890 late Thursday. Other dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.8655 West German marks, up from 1.8475; 1.5465 Swiss francs, up from 1.5320; 6.2860 French francs, up from 6.2315; 2.1030 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0815; 1,380.98 Italian lire, up from 1,367.75; 1.2088 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2085 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar ended the week at 133.40 yen, up 0.45 yen from Thursday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, after the release of the report, it was quoted at 134.75 yen. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 438 a troy ounce and at midmorning the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 438.10. Both were lower than Thursday's late bid of $ 439. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 438, down from late Thursday's $ 441 Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold dropped 48 cents an ounce to close at a bid of $ 440.05. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 7.30 late this morning, down from late Thursday's $ 7.35.

The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 11.1 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,852.2 at midday. Volume was light at 288.8 million shares, compared with 297.8 million shares at the same time Thursday.

<HEAD>Macmillan To Appeal Injunction Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it would appeal a judge's ruling that blocks the publishing giant from proceeding with a massive massive restructuring designed to thwart an unwanted bid from the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> After nearly five weeks of consideration, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday issued a 58-page opinion granting <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>'s request for a preliminary injunction that effectively blocks the restructuring. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> said in a statement that it was taking an expedited appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to reverse the decision. An unidentified <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> spokesman said in the statement that <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' ruling was `` erroneous as a matter of law'' and that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> was confident of succeeding on appeal. The ruling came after the close of the stock market. But in trading on te <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> fell 50 cents to $ 74 on Thursday. <PERSON> Josy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON>, an attorney representing the Texas-based Bass group, had no comment on whether <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> would proceed with a tender offer. The group previously had said it would launch a tender offer upon granting of a preliminary injunction. `` There's no action to prevent anybody from doing a tender offer,'' she said. The Bass group also has said it has the necessary financing to complete its $ 1.9 billion buyout. Bass originally offered to acquire <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> for $ 64 a share in May, but raised his bid to $ 73 a share, or about $ 1.9 billion for the 90.1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> shares the group does not already own after the publisher unveiled its restructuring plan. <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> said the judge found that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s attempt to restructure was an unreasonable response to <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>'s takeover proposal. Based on legal precedents, `` when a board does something in reaction to an offer for the company, there has to be a threat ... and there was n't a threat'' in this case, she said from her <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del. office. Bass had charged that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s restructuring, which would have separated the company's information services and publishing operations into two separate, publicly traded companies, was inadequate and misleading. The group also charged that the plan would have transferred control to four top <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> executives for a cheap price. In rejecting <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>'s buyout offer as well as a counter proposal to restructure the company, <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly said its own plan was in the best interest of shareholders. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> was just hours away from beginning its restructuring, which included paying shareholders a special $ 52.35-a-share dividend, when <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order on June 10. <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>'s restructuring plan would pay shareholders a dividend of $ 58 per share.

<HEAD>Report Calls For Improved Working, Living Conditions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government report, noting that Japanese work longer than people in other industrialized nations but have less buying power, calls for improved working and living conditions in this country. The report, issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> Friday, urged shorter work weeks, lower consumer prices, more housing land and cheaper housing. The report said Japanese worked an average 2,150 hours in 1986, the last year for which such statistics were available, compared to 1,938 hours for Britons, 1,924 hours for Americans, 1,655 hours for West Germans and 1,643 hours for the French, said <PERSON> Atsuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON> of the ministry's Labor Affairs Division. Of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s total workforce of 60.8 million, 59.11 were employed in 1987, for an unemployment rate of 2.8 percent compared to 6.2 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 7.9 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 10.4 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and 10.6 percent in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, according to Miss <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> calculates its unemployment rate differently from other Western countries, counting its armed forces and those who work as little as one hour a month. Japanese officials say <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s official rate would be about double if it were calculated by Western methods. Women accounted for 36.5 percent of the work force last year, the report said. The average worker's annual salary in 1987 was 4.99 million yen, or $ 38,380, including summer and winter bonuses, Miss <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON> quoted the report as saying. Workers in primary industry _ farming, forestry, fishing and mining _ numbered 5.41 million, or 9.3 percent of all workers, in 1985, the most recent year for which statistics were available, she said. In the secondary or manufacturing industry, there were 19.33 million workers, or 33.1 percent of the working population. The largest number of workers in 1985 were 33.44 million in tertiary industry, defined as power and water supply, transport, communications, sales, food, financial, real estate and public sectors, the report said. They represented 53.7 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s working population that year, Miss <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON> said The report noted 18.9 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s workforce was older than 55 last year, as opposed to 12.9 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 10.2 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s annual consumer inflation rate rose to 4.6 percent in June, up 0.4 percent from the previous month, the government reported Friday.

The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> attributed the monthly rise to higher prices for motor vehicles, non-seasonal foods, gasoline and clothing.

 Wholesale prices one step short of retail rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June, the government said today. But the drought searing much of the nation sent prices for raw food soaring at their steepest pace in more than 2 -LCB- years. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said raw costs jumped 4.2 percent last month, a rate not seen since the 5.1 percent climb of October 1985. Further along in the wholesale process, however, prices for foods ready to be retailed rose 1.1 percent, reflecting earlier, though less severe, increases in raw food costs. Some examples of price increases at the unprocessed-food level: _ Wheat, 25.3 percent _ Corn, 24.3 percent _ Turkeys, 22.8 percent _ Soybeans 22.0 percent _ Chickens, 22.5 percent Reflecting the fact that many farmers are slaughtering animals they can not afford or find feed for, cattle prices fell 5.2 percent while hog prices were down 4.0 percent. The news was not quite so severe at the finished-goods level. Prices for eggs rose 16.0 percent while turkey prices gained 9.3 percent, chicken prices jumped 7.3 percent and fresh fruit costs gained 6.7 percent. Those gains were partially offset by a 5.7 percent decline in vegetable prices and a 2.2 percent decrease for rice. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottman </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said that prices of foods made from grain, such a vegetable oils, bakery products and pasta, likely will continue to rise, and that the drop in vegetable prices wo n't last. Meat prices should continue to fall through late autumn, but will then head higher after the drought-induced slaughtering tails off, he said. `` Next year we'll probably see the full impact of the drought, particularly if it persists. Up until this week we could say, ` Well, if we get some rain, we'll probably be all right.' But this week is the last week we can say that,'' he said. Energy prices, meanwhile, fell at the finished level by 1.6 percent. Leading the way was a drop of 7.1 percent for fuel oil while declines of 2.4 percent and 1.0 percent were posted for gasoline and natural gas respectively. Further energy price declines are considered likely because crude oil prices have fallen over the last month to their lowest levels in nearly two years. `` We can just thank our fortunes that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ca n't get together on restraint of production. I hate to think what the report would look like if oil prices were rising,'' <PERSON> Kottman </PERSON> said. In other economic news: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit rose slightly in May to $ 10.9 billion, but the imbalance was still the second smallest in almost three years The gap between imports and exports widened by $ 627 million from a revised April imbalance of $ 10.3 billion. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June, the ninth consecutive month without a The June increase, boosted by an increase in electricity use during the heat wave, pushed industrial output 5.8 percent higher than it was a year ago. _ Business inventories in May rose a moderate 0.6 percent to $ 728.4 billion, held in check by a 0.9 percent jump in sales to $ 483.7 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Overall, if the June increase in wholesale finished goods prices held for 12 straight months, the inflation rate would be 4.6 percent annually, more than double the 2.2 percent rise of 1987. Subtracting the effects of volatile food and energy prices, wholesale prices rose 0.3 percent last month. Analysts consider this rate a better indication of the economy's underlying inflation Even with steep food price gains anticipated for the several months, many economists feel the effect of those gains will be only temporary. For the first half of 1988, prices one step short of retail rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, wholesale costs rose 4.0 over that period. Prices from March through June have risen at a monthly rate of either 0.4 percent or 0.5 percent. At the finished level, the department gave these other price changes: _ Passenger car prices, up 1.0 percent _ Women's clothing, up 1.0 percent _ Home electronic equipment, down 2.2 percent _ Cosmetics, down 0.6 percent The June increase brought the wholesale price index for finished goods to 107.9, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 in 1982 would have cost $ 107.90 last month, 40 cents more than in May. This calculation is not adjusted for seasonal variations, as are other calculations in the report. The Consumer Price Index, which tracks services and imported goods not included in the wholesale price report, has risen at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.4 percent over the first five months of the year, the same rate as for all of 19878. Consumer price figures for June will be released next week.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade deficit expanded only slightly in May and inflation remained moderate in June, the government said today in encouraging reports that sent the dollar soaring. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the trade deficit rose to $ 10.9 billion in May from a revised $ 10.3 billion in April, but the number was still the second smallest in almost three years and well within economists' expectations. Imports rose 3.4 percent to about $ 37.6 billion, but the increase was offset by a 2.3 percent increase in exports, which rose to about $ 26.6 billion, very close to the record level for exports set in March. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June, despite a searing drought that sent prices for raw food soaring at their steepest pace in more than 2 -LCB- years. In other reports released today, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said June industrial production rose 0.4 percent, largely because of higher electricity output, and the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said May business inventories rose 0.6 percent, which suggested a slight slowdown in sales. But those reports were n't watched as closely as the news on trade and inflation, which was better than many thought and sent money traders scrambling to buy dollars. The currency's strong advance prompted some central banks to sell dollars in the market to stem the rise, traders reported. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar surged over 1.8750 marks in hectic trading, compared with 1.8507 late Thursday, and 135.10 Japanese yen compared with 133.18 late Thursday. The British pound fell to $ 1.662 from $ 1.689. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose about 7 points to the 2,121 level in early trading, but retreated by late morning. In the bond market, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year issue also rose on the trade and inflation news but fell back later and was little changed by late morning. On Thursday, the markets reacted indifferently to a hike in the prime rate by major banks from 9 percent to 9.5 percent, the highest in more than two years. Stocks and the dollar rose slightly and bonds were mixed. The banks' hike in the prime rate, which had been widely expected in the financial markets, reflected a rise in their own borrowing costs and signaled more expensive loans for consumers and businesses. The move marked the second time this year the nation's banks have raised the prime, which is used to calculate a range of fixed-and adjustable-rate corporate and consumer loans. Economists had been expecting such a move because of evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has tightened credit over the past few months in an attempt to curb inflation. The rate increase came one day after the central bank's chairman, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had been tightening and that holding down inflation remained his key priority Some economists saw a significant connection between his remarks and the banks' action. In other economic news on Thursday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said retail sales rose a moderate 0.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 132.8 billion in June It said sales rose 0.3 percent in May, an upward revision from the previous estimate of 0.1 percent. _ President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> toured the drought-stricken Farm Belt and promised farmers that `` we will do everything that we can'' to help At the same time, he called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act quickly on a package of legislation aimed at making emergency federal aid available to farmers. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved disaster legislation that would provide payments of up to $ 100,000 each to farmers whose crops have been wrecked by the drought

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened lower but quickly turned mixed in volatile activity today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts attributed the lower opening to a continuation of the profit-taking that surfaced late in Thursday's session following two days of sharply higher prices. Forecasts for another month of hot, dry weather in the parched Corn Belt provided incentive for traders to bid prices higher this morning but uncertainty about the prospects for rain next week added an element of edginess to the markets, analysts said, `` People are not sure we're not going to get another rain front in the middle of next week and the markets are very, very nervous,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In early trading, wheat was 3 cents to 7 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.91 a bushel; corn was 3 -LCB- cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.36 a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with July at $ 3.07 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 15 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 9.81 a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .25 cent higher with August at 64.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .85 cent higher with August at 74.65 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent lower to .65 cent higher with July at 45.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .80 cent to 1.40 cents higher with July at 36.70 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Thursday.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' top man in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> for two decades, today upset <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s hand-picked choice to succeed him as president of the nation's largest The Teamsters' 1-member General Executive Board picked <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 69, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> over Secretary-Treasurer <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> had named acting president on May 4. While several of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' 16 regional vice presidents had jockeyed for position to succeed <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, the race had narrowed to <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> in the last week. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who has a reputation of being a tough negotiator with a quick temper, will serve out <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s five-year term, which expires in 1991, when the union holds its next international convention. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, 61, had been president of the 1.6-million member union since 1983. At the time of his death from cancer last Saturday, he was under federal indictment on charges of labor racketeering and embezzlement. The government is attempting to seize control of the union through a court-appointed trustee, claiming its entire leadership is either under the control of organized crime figures or incapable of removing their influence from <LOCATION> Teamster </LOCATION> affairs. Among the allegations in the government takeover suit filed two weeks ago is that mob bosses in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were behind elevating <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to the union's presidency in 1981 and <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> to the post in 1983. A federal criminal court jury in May found that the government lacked sufficient proof, and attorneys for the union have vehemently argued there is no organized crime influence at the top of the union. While several of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' 16 regional vice presidents had jockeyed for the position, sources close to the union said the race had narrowed to <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, 62, was picked by <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> in 1985 to be the Teamsters' No 2 official. A year later, <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> engineered a change in the union's constitution so that <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> rather than First Vice President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Trerotola </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would fill his shoes if he were incapacitated. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, a Teamster vice president since 1969, was said by several sources Thursday to have the support of at least seven other board members, including <PERSON> Trerotola </PERSON>, veteran head of the union's <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> operations. `` The Presser forces have lined up behind <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Trerotola </LOCATION> forces have lined up behind <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>,'' one source said Thursday. `` Everyone's reading is that it is real close.'' Breaking a long-held tradition to keep internal disputes among Teamster leaders behind closed doors, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> has spoken out in local union halls condemning the union's new three-year National Master Freight Agreement with the trucking industry. The contract covering some 200,000 members was rejected in May by 64 percent of those voting. However, <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> declared it ratified under the union's constitution, which requires a two-thirds no vote for disapproval. According to one source, <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> offered during a board meeting two weeks ago in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> to support <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> for the No. 2 job but <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> declined. Ten days after he was named acting president, <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> resigned as president of Teamsters Local 728 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, his base of power in the union. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating allegations of vote fraud made by dissidents who had challenged <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>' re-election as the local's president last fall

 Like a casino player fingering the chips in his pocket, corporate raider <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is likely to wait awhile before he walks up to the window and cashes in his <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock for a multimillion-dollar prize. The beleagured oil giant's largest shareholder and most vocal critic is just days away from being able to sell his roughly 36 million shares and keep the profits. But will he? Speaking from his new offices in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said that `` at this point we have n't made any decision yet'' about the 14.8 percent <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stake. He noted there is `` a myriad of possibilities _ including doing nothing _ and we've made no determination of what we're going to do.'' Under the `` short-swing'' profit rule, a holder of more than 5 percent of a company's stock must keep those shares for at least six months, otherwise any profits revert back to the company. That period ends Wednesday for <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock traded at just over $ 45 a share on Friday. At that price, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has a paper profit of about $ 410 million, based on his average purchase price of $ 34 a share. Wall Streeters agree <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is least likely to just dump the shares on the open market, considering the depressing effect such a move would have on <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price. `` The bottom line is that neither <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> nor <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> want to see the shares go down,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ting </PERSON>, an analyst at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Far more handsome would be the sale of <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s shares in a block to a third party willing to pay a heftier price At $ 60 a share, the price <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> put on the table in his proposed $ 14 billion-plus buyout, he would reap nearly a billion in profits. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> would not comment on whether he had spoken recently with <ORGANIZATION> Husky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, two companies with whom he once discussed a joint <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> bid. `` It's impossible to know if he is under pressure to liquidate something,'' said <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilacqua </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` But if he believes the assets are worth $ 70 to $ 80 a share, why would he sell at $ 46? When asked whether <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had been in contact with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> regarding the disposition of his holdings, a spokeswoman said the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based company `` does not comment on the activities of our shareholders.'' But a source close to the company said, `` Obviously -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is concerned about <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, they know that he is not someone you take lightly.'' `` I would assume <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management would like to get him out, and get their stock up in the $ 50s,'' <PERSON> Ilacqua </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s concession of defeat in a heated proxy contest for five seats on <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board does not put the oil giant's managment in the clear. Some experts speculate <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> might be waiting to see just how close he came in the battle, which took place last month at the company's annual meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has said it would take between three and four weeks for an official tally, and results are expected soon. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who also heads <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was dealt what might have been a fatal blow in the fight by the aggressive leveraged buyout firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which voted its 4.9 percent stake for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management. In conceding defeat shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> called the company's stake the swing vote. But analysts are not so sure. One suggested <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s losing margin may have been far wider than he has let on. `` If it had been a close call, he would n't have conceded defeat,'' said one analyst who asked not to be quoted by name. `` His nature is being a battler, stubborn and persistent.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> is knee-deep in its own restructuring, which includes a $ 3 billion payment to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to settle a lawsuit resulting from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> had made earlier moves to acquire <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has begun selling off up to $ 5 billion worth of marginally profitable assets and says it will distribute $ 1.7 billion of the proceeds to shareholders. That, coupled with the $ 3-a-share annual dividend the oil company has resumed paying already spells a decent return for <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. Wall Street insiders look upon <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> as a `` trader type,'' someone whose long-term strategy may be vague and whose forte is quick decisions. A month ago one analyst said he would `` rather go to Vegas'' than predict what <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> might do. When asked again this week, he said he would still rather go to the gambling resort.

<HEAD>Consumer Attitudes, The Best Bet Against Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Everyone is worrying about inflation, but a lot of folks are doing something about it, and they just might have the final say. Those folks are consumers, and they have been resisting price increases for several years now and seem intent on continuing their vigilance. This is n't an assumption; the activity shows up in official statistics. The measurements that prove the case are the gross national product implicit price deflator and the gross national product fixed-weight price index. For practical purposes, the important thing to remember about the fixed-weight price index is that it measures only changes in prices, and these prices are of the same products month after month. The implicit price deflator is a bit more sophisticated, measuring not just prices but changes in the composition of purchases. It has been rising much more slowly than its more rigid cousin. The importance of this disparity is that it indicates a resistance to price increases by consumers. They have continued to buy, but they have avoided items rising in price and, when possible, switched to more stable items. Such behavior is enormously significant, suggesting a fundamental change in consumer attitudes from earlier periods. An analysis by <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> contrasts this price resistance to the attitude that prevailed during much of the 1960s and 1970s, when consumers simply went ahead and bought. In fact, many consumers bought more than they needed at any given time, convinced that future prices would be even higher. Those were very different times. Consumers were fatalistic, convinced that they could have little impact on pricing factors. Why try to hold down the budget when <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was forcing up gasoline and heating oil prices? But there was more to it than that. Many workers had broad cost-of-living increases built into union contracts, enabling them to offset higher prices. Industry's attitude toward wage increases was simply to give in and then raise prices. And, for reasons not explained logically, there existed a feeling that inflation was a way of life that could n't be disciplined. In those days, the two indicators of inflation rose in relation to each other. It was only in the 1980s that they began to diverge, indicating that consumers felt they could do something about pricing, such as declining to buy. This relatively new sense of consumer power is especially noticeable in automobile sales, which for several years have relied on incentives. Take away those incentives and sales dive; replace them and they rise again. It has occurred in housing sales as well, as many would-be sellers in some of the more affluent neighborhoods have discovered over the past few months. Houses that a year ago sold within days of listing, now remain on the market for months, even though mortgages have been relatively easy to obtain. Some retailers are complaining, but in view of today's consumer attitude you might say they should have known better. Early this year apparel prices rose sharply, followed quickly by sales problems for many apparel retailers. The new attitude has n't been lost on producers of services and manufactured goods, many of whom have chosen to absorb higher costs in order to maintain sales, rather than pass on increases and lose customer loyalty. The resistance applies even to interest rates. Strange as it sounds to some folks who could n't get an appointment with a bank loan officer a few years ago, many banks now advertise for customers, especially for home loans. The new attitude can be found in, of all places, wage settlements. Learning from the 1970s, when wage increases were more than offset by price increases, workers have been seeking less, opting instead for wage-price stability. It is encouraging news, this inflation fight by a lot of ordinary folks. Together, they make an anti-inflation force as strong as almost any other, perhaps even matching the vaunted power of the August <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Woman Brain-Damaged in Audi Crash Awarded Nearly $2.2 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 German automaker <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> says it will appeal a jury's award of nearly $ 2.2 million to a brain-damaged woman injured in a crash the jury blamed partly on an alleged defect in her car. A Superior Court jury made the award Wednesday to <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, 53, who was injured when her 1981 <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000S crashed into a wall as she drove down <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> <PERSON> Canyon </PERSON> in May 1982. The jury agreed with Mrs. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawyers' contention that the accident was caused by a design defect that places the car's gas and brake pedals too close together. Jurors found <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 75 percent at fault and Ms. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> 25 percent responsible for leaving her seat belt unbuckled. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> denies there is any defect, and argued that Mrs. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> took a curve too fast and lost control, said spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The company, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, will appeal the decision, he said Thursday. Mrs. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> was alone in the car and there were no witnesses. The case rested on testimony of expert witnesses from each side. The case is unrelated to uncontrolled acceleration problems in automatic-transmission <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000S models that prompted a 1987 recall of all 240,000 <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 models sold in this country since 1978. The cars were fitted with shift-lock devices which require a driver to press the brake pedal before operating the automatic transmission. In addition to the almost $ 2.2 million award to Mrs. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, the jury awarded her husband, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, $ 700,000 for his suffering. Mrs. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> suffered a broken neck, brain damage and bladder problems and has incurred medical expenses of more than $ 500,000, her lawyers said. The jury found <ORGANIZATION> Volkwagen </ORGANIZATION> innocent of malice despite the design defect, ruling the company did not deliberately disregard the rights and safety of others. The Audi 5000 has been recalled twice before: In 1982 to raise the height of the brake pedal so the brakes will work even if the driver steps on the brake and accelerator pedal at the same time; and in 1981 to anchor floor carpets so they could n't slide up over the accelerator and keep it from rising when the driver's foot is removed.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Papers Show Coleco Has Negative Net Worth Of $156
Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which earlier this week filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, said in court papers it has a negative net worth of $ 156 million. The toy manufacturer listed assets of $ 384.3 million and liabilities of $ 540.3 million in its petition filed late Monday in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. The West Hartford-based company, whose fortunes rose and fell with the popularity of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, said it owes $ 104.3 million to secured creditors, including $ 94.4 million to 11 foreign and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks that loaned it money to finance daily operations. It also owes $ 335 million to investors who bought <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> bonds during four separate issues over the past several years. The company is in default on interest payments on those bonds. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> owes another $ 135.2 million to more than 1,200 other creditors. Among the 20 largest creditors are six manufacturing firms in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> owed $ 13.69 million. Most of the company's toys have been made in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. A Chapter 11 filing allows a company protection from its creditors while it reorganizes and works out a plan for paying its debts. The bankruptcy papers also showed that <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, aware of the company's deteriorating financial position, first authorized the Chapter 11 filing nearly three months ago during an April 15 meeting. The board voted last week to file on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> has said it had to file for protection from creditors because it could not persuade banks and debt holders to restructure its heavy debt load. Without a restructuring, the company said, it could not obtain financing to guarantee it could continue producing toys. The papers also revealed that 35 creditors owed a total of $ 2.7 million have sued <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>, including landlords seeking overdue rent and suppliers seeking payment for business forms, heating oil, and packaging. The largest case explained in the bankruptcy petition is one filed May 19 by <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> air freight company that is seeking payment of $ 1.5 million. <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> shipped toys for the company for several months last year.

<HEAD>Eastern, Machinists Far Apart, Negotiator Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its combative <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union are $ 200 million apart on terms of a new contract, according to a company negotiator, even though the union says it has made a series of concessions. Meanwhile, the steadily shrinking airline is considering abandoning <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, according to a report published Friday. The protracted negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the Machinists have prompted the concern of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation, which is circulating a letter that would ask the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to expedite the talks. The letter asks the board to set `` a definite time frame for resolution'' of the problems, according to an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Democrat, but does not ask for a 30-day cooling-off period. Eastern's negotiators say the union's latest proposal, made Wednesday, is `` disappointing.'' In a letter circulated to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> managers, chief negotiator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> claimed the Machinists' proposal would cost the carrier $ 50 million a year, while the company was demanding $ 160 million in cost cuts. `` The parties are now more than $ 200 million apart,'' he wrote. Machinists negotiator <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> responded that his union has made a steady string of concessions in an effort to win a new contract, but Eastern has rejected them. The Machinists' latest two-year proposal calls for a 1.5 percent pay raise in the first year and a 5 percent increase in the second year, compared with the two 10 percent raises the union asked for when the talks began. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the union also has agreed to more flexible work rules and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s voluntary job retraining program. The <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that sources in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> and pilots unions, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the negotiations include stipulations by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> that it will cut back and perhaps abandon operations at the <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> airport as early as this fall. Eastern's gates are the second-busiest at <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> carries around 26 percent of the passenger traffic and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> about 23 percent. Eastern operates 14 flights a day out of the airport, and increases that number by four or five during the winter. But Eastern has been retrenching for the past year, pulling out of some markets in favor of those areas where business is stronger. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the fall flight schedule wo n't be released for several weeks, but that union claims that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is facing a 20 percent to 25 percent reduction in flight hours `` is probably pretty factual.'' `` Surely -LRB- the fall schedule -RRB- has n't been put to bed yet, and it'll probably change 50 times before it is put to bed,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` As it now stands, we may see a reduction. But we have no intentions of withdrawing from <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>.'' Eastern is a subsidiary of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest airline company.

 Stock prices flattened out today after an early advance faded. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 10 points in the early going, was down .18 at 2,113.44 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 611 up, 722 down and 535 unchanged. The market registered a brief favorable response to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that the merchandise trade deficit in May was $ 10.9 billion, slightly below most advance estimates. However, analysts noted that the deficit figure for April was revised upward to $ 10.3 billion from $ 9.9 billion. In other economic news, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in June. That too came in lower than expected, considering the surge in prices of many farm commodities as a result of the drought.

<HEAD>Ford Buying Land Adjacent to Avon Lake Plant, Wants EPA Expansion

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it will purchase 108 acres for possible expansion next to its <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, truck plant, which has been suggested as a site for a <ORGANIZATION> Ford-Nissan </ORGANIZATION> joint venture. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> applied June 2 for an <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> permit to install environmental equipment that would be required for expansion or new construction, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhlberg </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> said the agency has conducted an initial review of the application but is awaiting further information about the project, which <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is expected to submit within a month. `` Our engineers are looking at Aug. 11 to get together and go over the additional information and review the full permit application,'' <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> said. If <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> decided to go ahead with construction, it would have to apply for a separate permit to operate the equipment. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to give details on the possible expansion or new construction, saying only that making such an EPA application is routine when either are being considered because the federal process takes so long. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd, based in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said earlier this year that they had decided to move into the second stage of a study of a possible joint venture, examining potential plant sites, vehicles and parts sources But <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisenhelder </PERSON> cautioned against connecting the land purchase and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> application to the joint venture, often reported to be a Ford-Nissan minivan. `` We have n't made a decision that there's even going to be a joint venture. It's pure speculation at this point,'' <PERSON> Meisenhelder </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> exercised an option on the land but had yet to close the purchase, <PERSON> Meisenhelder </PERSON> added. The 1 million-square-foot, 1,500-worker <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> plant builds and paints bodies for <ORGANIZATION> Econoline </ORGANIZATION> vans and Club Wagons. The bodies are trucked to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, assembly plant, where they are married to chassis. The <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> plant is <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s largest in the world at 3.3 million square feet, <PERSON> Muhlberg </PERSON> said. It also builds Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar cars. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> bought the <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> site from <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1972. It added 60 acres to its original 170 acres in 1973. The new purchase brings the site's total acreage to 338.

 Grain futures closed mixed while soybeans posted strong gains Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid conflicting weather forecasts for the drought-stricken Farm Belt. Forecasts for next week's weather were so mixed that `` every time I pick up the telephone I hear a different one,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, Chicago-based grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Temperatures soared above 100 degrees Friday afternoon in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and some private meteorologists were calling for dry conditions and searing temperatures to linger in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> through Thursday. `` If that's true, we're going to go higher and higher next week,' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said other forecasters expected cooler temperatures and scattered showers to move into the region this weekend. `` We're in the hands of the weather and the weatherman,'' he said. The mixed finish ended a week marked by wide swings in futures prices. For example, soybeans for July delivery ranged during the week from $ 8.56 to $ 10.20 a bushel. At the close, wheat was 3 cents lower to 5 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.85 a bushel; corn was 7 -LCB- cents lower to 1 cent higher with July at $ 3.32 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 7 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.11 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 33 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 9.95 a bushel.

 Second-quarter profits at <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> soared 50 percent amid sharply higher sales of the company's communications and computer products, the suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> firm said Thursday <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 120 million, or 93 cents per share, for the three months ended June 30, compared with $ 80 million, or 62 cents per share for the same period a year ago.

<HEAD>British Aerospace to Proceed with Rover Takeover Despite Aid Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> will go ahead with its takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Rover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> despite conditions the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has imposed on the deal, the government said Thursday. The commission on Wednesday approved the takeover on the condition that the British government cut by $ 428 million the amount of cash the government is to inject simultaneously into the state-owned automaker. Trade Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> in an emergency statement: `` Talks with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> this morning have clarified the position in terms satisfactory to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>.''. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> commissioners agreed to requests for certain changes in the details of the deal's treatment of Rover tax losses. British Aerospace had reached an agreement with the government to acquire its 99.8-percent stake in the automaker for $ 254 million. At the same time, the government had said it would inject $ 1.35 billion into Rover to reduce the automaker's debt. But the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> commission, which has the power to block deals that it considers harmful to competition in the 12-nation Common Market, said Wednesday it approved a smaller aid package of $ 793 million. Because some regional aid also would be allowed, the state subsidy effectively would be reduced to $ 924 million, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. British Aerospace on Wednesday had requested more time to consider its proposed takeover in light of the conditions.

<HEAD>Producers Say Steel Imports Surged in May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Steel imports surged in May to their highest level since July 1986, domestic producers said Friday. An importers association, interpreting the same <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> data, said, however, that imports, excluding semi-finished metal bound for processing on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> mills, were held within the limits of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel quota system for the first five months of the year. May imports totaled 1.94 million tons, compared with 1.53 million tons in April and 1.85 million tons in May 1987, according to the American Iron and <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Imports of all steel products, including semi-finshed ordered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers, totaled 9.05 million tons, up from 8.4 million tons in the comparable 1987 period, the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> AISI </ORGANIZATION> said. `` These figures reinforce the domestic industry's assertion that the system of voluntary restraint agreements, which has been in effect since October 1984, should be extended for at least another five years,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> AISI </ORGANIZATION> said in a printed statement. The American producers said the quotas program `` has fallen short of its objective for the almost four-year period of its implementation.'' Excluding semi-finished steel, January through May imports totaled 7.8 million tons, or 17.8 percent of apparent domestic consumption. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> set a limit of 18.5 percent market penetration when he initiated the quotas. American steelmakers imported about 238,000 tons out of the 1.93 million tons imported in May, the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> AIIS </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Steel imports have been a critical support for American steel producers, who could contiue to meet demand as a result of imported steel slab,'' said <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, AIIS president and vice chairman of the importing firm <ORGANIZATION> Steelinter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. `` Industry and government should carefully review the fact that imports relieve shortages and cut costs.''

 The dollar zoomed to recent highs against several major currencies Friday on a continuing wave of bullish sentiment that overwhelmed heavy selling by central banks around the world. The dollar's rise began in foreign markets and was bolstered here by the release of the most recent figures on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. So strong was the dollar's move, the currency managed to finish at the highs of the day even after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and a host of European central banks intervened to subdue its steady climb. Traders speculated the banks collectively may have sold as much as $ 2 billion or more. Gold prices were mixed. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on the merchandise trade deficit for May came in at $ 10.9 billion, supporting views that the nation's trade imbalance is improving. While the figure was up from a revised April deficit of $ 10.3 billion, it was still the second smallest in almost three years. But the dollar did not wait for the release of the trade numbers to start moving upward. `` It was really uncanny because ... even before the release of the trade numbers we sensed a great deal of buying from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, manager of corporate foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Attributing the dollar's rise strictly to the trade report would be `` underplaying the overall positive sentiment toward the dollar. That sentiment is already built into the market,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` The fact that the market reacted this way to very average trade numbers shows the underlying shift toward the dollar,'' he added. Further supporting the dollar was a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that said the producer price index rose a modest 0.4 percent in June. Traders said the report hinted at increased purchasing power for the dollar. Intervention was heavy in both European and domestic dealings. Traders in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> said the Swiss, Dutch, Belgian, British, <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> and Swedish central banks joined in when the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> began selling dollars. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was actively selling dollars in the domestic market, but the currency proceeded to pierce key psychological barriers against several currencies. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar finished at 133.40 yen, up 0.45 yen from Thursday's close. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 135.35 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar closed at 135.45 yen, up from 133.18 yen on Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained more than 2.5 cents against the British pound to reach its highest level since October. It cost $ 1.6635 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.6890 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar put in its best showing since October against the pound, which cost $ 1.6605, far cheaper than Thursday's $ 1.6875 The dollar finished at its highest levels against the Italian lire and the French franc in 18 months and its highest levels against the West German mark, the Swiss franc, and the Dutch guilder since last summer. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday: 1.8815 West German marks, up from 1.8507; 1.5588 Swiss francs, up from 1.5340; 6.3385 French francs, up from 6.2355; 1,391.63 Italian lire, up from 1,370.38, and 1.2101 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2095. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday: 1.8780 West German marks, up from 1.8475; 1.5555 Swiss francs, up from 1.5320; 6.3285 French francs, up from 6.2315; 2.1150 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0815; 1,387.25 Italian lire, up from 1,367.75, and 1.2117 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2085. Gold prices rose slightly in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading after declining overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> reported a bid for gold as of 4 p.m. EDT of $ 440 a troy ounce, up from $ 438.35 on Thursday. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold finished at $ 440.20 a troy ounce, up from $ 438.70 on Thursday. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 438.40 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 439. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 439, compared with late Thursday's $ 441. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold dropped 48 cents an ounce to a bid of $ 440.05. Silver bullion on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> finished at $ 7.310 a troy ounce, up from $ 7.280 on Thursday. But earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the metal fell to a late bid price of $ 7.30 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 7.35.

<HEAD>Grain Futures End Wild Week With A Whimper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Conflicting weather forecasts for the drought-stricken Farm Belt brought a wild week of grain trading to a fairly subdued close Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Soybeans posted strong gains but corn and wheat were mixed. On other markets, pork bellies surged the limit for daily trading; precious metals were slightly higher; energy futures were mixed; and stock index futures advanced. Forecasts for next week's weather were so mixed that `` every time I pick up the telephone I hear a different one,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, Chicago-based grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Temperatures soared above 100 degrees Friday afternoon in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and some private meteorologists were calling for dry conditions and searing temperatures to linger in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> through Thursday. But other private forecasters expected cooler temperatures and scattered showers to move into the region this weekend. `` We're in the hands of the weather and the weatherman,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, agreed: `` People are not sure we're not going to get another rain front in the middle of next week, and the markets are very, very nervous.'' The drought has taken a heavy toll on the corn crop. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated in a report on Tuesday that 1988 corn production would fall 27 percent below last year, and the damage mounted during the week as the stunted crop neared the end of its pollination stage. Soybeans will enter a critical growing period within two weeks, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report predicted a 14 percent drop in soybean production, based on Tuesday's conditions. Friday's mixed close ended a week marked by wide swings in prices. Soybeans for July delivery ranged during the week from $ 8.56 to $ 10.20 a bushel and July corn ranged from $ 2.86 to $ 3.50 a bushel. Heavy profit-taking dragged soybeans down to a 5-week low on Monday. But the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> crop report renewed fears of heavy yield losses, and traders responded by bidding prices back up to levels close to the previous week's highs. Wheat settled 4 cents lower to 5 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.84 a bushel; corn was 7 cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.33 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 7 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.11 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 7 -LCB- cents to 32 cents higher with July at $ 9.94 -LCB- a bushel. Frozen pork belly futures continued their recovery from recent lows near 32 cents a pound amid higher cash prices and retail featuring of bacon, analysts said. Friday's gain of 2 cents a pound _ the maximum allowed _ on contracts for July and August delivery marked the fourth straight day of the pork belly rally on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. A decline in hog slaughter numbers lent additional support to the belly and hog futures, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> AgriVisor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, Ill. Most cattle futures advanced in pre-weekend position-squaring, analysts said. Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .85 cent higher with August at 64.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .80 cent higher with August at 74.75 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower to .75 cent higher with July at 46.27 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .68 cent to 2 cents higher with July at 37.30 cents a pound. The soaring dollar kept a lid on the precious metals market despite the possibility that Peruvian silver miners will launch a nationwide strike on Monday. The dollar soared against several currencies in reaction to the government's report of a $ 10.9 billion merchandise trade deficit in May. `` This was a fantastically strong dollar,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, precious metals analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It just surged and put pressure on outside markets.'' Gold settled $ 1 to $ 1.40 higher with August at $ 441.30 a troy ounce; silver was 3 cents higher across the board with July at $ 7.31 a troy ounce. Energy futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in light pre-weekend trading that brokers attributed largely to internal market influences. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 16 cents lower to 10 cents higher with August at $ 14.86 a barrel; heating oil was .21 cent to .45 cent higher with August at 41.12 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .91 cent lower to .01 cent higher with August at 49.73 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.35 points higher at 272.80.

 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lawmaker on Friday charged that British <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 4.5 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> threatens jobs and anti-smoking efforts and urged state regulators to reject the move. `` I have serious doubts about whether we should permit ... hostile takeovers of American companies by foreign firms, which are not motivated by a long-term commitment to the maintenance of American jobs or the well-being of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Democrat. The bid must be approved by nine states in which the insurance company operates. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have rejected the bid. But <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said litigation is planned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. A spokesman for BAT Industries' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary, the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky.-based <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, could not be reached for comment. But the company said in a statement that it has extended to Aug. 11 the deadline of its tender offer to purchase all of Farmers' outstanding common shares for $ 63 each BAT is the world's largest tobacco company; Farmers, based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, is a leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insurance company. Hostile takeovers `` have consumed larger and larger shares of American capital and productive capacity,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said, calling takeovers by foreign-owned companies particularly worrisome. Farmers has 1,940 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> employees, 2,000 agents and more than 1.26 million policy holders in the state. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said the takeover would `` jeopardize the jobs of employees and the security of policyholders in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' many of whom have taken advantage of premium discounts for non-smokers. BAT `` has indicated it does not approve of and would not continue Farmers' health-oriented, money-saving, anti-smoking efforts,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. Besides offering discounts to non-smokers, the insurance company produces anti-smoking literature.

 Stock prices chalked up a moderate gain Friday in a restrained response to what most analysts described as favorable news on international trade. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 15.83 to 2,129.45, finishing the week with a net gain of 23.30. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 787 up, 632 down and 532 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 199.71 million shares, up from 172.41 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 225.86 million shares. The market registered a slight favorable response to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that the merchandise trade deficit in May stood at $ 10.9 billion, a bit below most advance estimates. The dollar gave the news a particularly warm reception, posting strong gains against leading foreign currencies. However, analysts also noted that the deficit figure for April was revised upward to $ 10.3 billion from $ 9.9 billion. In other economic news, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in June. That too came in lower than expected, considering the surge in prices of many farm commodities as a result of the drought. Industrial production rose 0.4 percent in June, for the ninth consecutive month without a decline, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said. International Business Machines gained -RCB- to 125 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s second-quarter earnings came in about as expected, up 12.7 percent excluding a special restructuring charge Elsewhere among the blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 to 46 |; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to 26 |; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LRB- to 79 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> -LCB- to 43 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> 1 | <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> jumped 5 -LCB- to 54 -RRB-. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Saligman </PERSON>, the company's chief executive, said he plans to recommend a major restructuring. Catalyst Energy rose | to 9 -RCB-. In a bidding contest for the company, <ORGANIZATION> Karibu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> raised its offer from $ 10.50 a share to $ 10.90. <ORGANIZATION> Rollins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 to 18 \ The company reported that earnings for the quarter ended June 30 rose to 20 cents a share from 16 cents in the comparable period a year earlier, but the figure evidently fell short of investors' expectations. Church's Fried Chicken, which cut its quarterly dividend from 11.5 cents a share to 5 cents a share, dropped -RRB- to 6. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 11.25 billion, or .42 percent, in value.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its second-quarter profit fell 18.1 percent, but would have risen 12.7 percent if not for the expense of a streamlining plan. Investors, apparently focusing on evidence that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was controlling costs better, bid the stock up 75 cents to $ 125.50 a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. `` It's a solid report,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` The growth in expenses is slowing without these special charges.'' Last month, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 600 million plan to consolidate manufacturing and headquarters operations that it said would probably lead to the resignation or retirement of 3,000 to 4,000 employees. While the company has succeeded in cutting costs, it has had less luck drumming up more business. Revenue rose 6.3 percent in the second quarter after an unusual blip of 10 percent growth in the first quarter. `` Our business continues to improve as a result of our actions to be more competitive, and customer response to our recent product announcements has been positive,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said its profit fell to $ 964 million, or $ 1.63 a share, from $ 1.18 billion, or $ 1.95 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 13.6 billion from $ 12.8 billion a year earlier. For the first six months of the fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said its profit rose 12.7 percent to $ 2.21 billion, or $ 3.73 a share, from $ 1.96 billion, or $ 3.25 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent to $ 25.3 billion from $ 23.5 billion. The cost of the restructuring, which <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> says will eventually benefit its profits, was charged to the second quarter and reduced earnings for the period by $ 364 million, or 61 cents a share. Earnings for the first quarter of 1988 were restated to reflect a change in accounting standards for deferred taxes. That change added 57 cents a share to first-quarter earnings, largely offsetting the negative impact of the restructuring charge on first-half results. Aside from the special charge, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> held the growth in costs and expenses to 5.8 percent in the second quarter, less than revenue growth, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. He predicted revenue would grow strongly next year with new products such as the F series of 3090 mainframe computers, the new Application System-400 midrange models, and improved operating software for its new personal computer line. `` It's been a tough five years for the company, but it looks like the pieces have fallen in place for a record 1989,'' he said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Battipaglia </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is also predicting <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 earnings per share will exceed the record of $ 10.77 set in 1984. But he said revenue growth is likely to remain subdued. `` I think that is a situation that may well be with them until the next significant leap in price and performance in the industry, and we really have n't had any,'' he said. <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, in his written statement, said, `` Our ongoing drive for efficiency and competitiveness and our continuing commitment to customer partnerships give us confidence for the future.''

<TEXT>
 Bond prices edged higher in moderate trading Friday as investors reacted to a surge in the dollar following the government's report that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for May had not worsened considerably. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond rose about \ point, or about $ 2.50 for every $ 1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, slipped to 9.14 percent from 9.17 percent late Thursday. Long bond prices made the biggest gains, but trading in those securities was light, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of money market research for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The bond market had been sluggish during the week in anticipation of three key economic reports _ on the trade deficit, producer prices and industrial production, all released Friday morning. But all of the reports were about as expected, and as a result had little impact on bond prices, analysts said. They said bond prices got a push, however, from the dollar's rise in foreign exchange markets. `` There were really no jolts or surprises as far as the economic data,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` But the international markets interpreted the trade figures very bullishly and the dollar moved up smartly. The dollar's firmer trend helped support higher bond prices.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported the deficit widened to $ 10.9 billion in May, from a revised April figure of $ 10.3 billion. Analysts had expected the trade gap would expand to the $ 11 billion area. The $ 10.9 billion imbalance was the second lowest in almost three years. `` The continued improved trend in the trade figures and strength in the dollar as a result of them have temporarily offset fears of higher short-term interest rates,'' said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> B. Front, an economist at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investment and mutual-fund management firm of <ORGANIZATION> Stein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Farnham </LOCATION>. A sharp widening of the trade gap in the past has hurt the dollar and led to declines in bond prices. Bond investors fear a lower dollar will lead to inflation, credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and surging interest rates. A moderate 0.4 percent rise for June in the government's Producer Price Index also boosted investor confidence, Front said `` Bond prices were up modestly reflecting a sense of relief that the trade figures and the Producer Price Index did n't provide any important shocks and did n't reveal any negatives,'' he said. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues rose about 1-16 point, intermediate maturities rose by between -LRB- point to 7-32 point and 20-year issues were up 5-32 point, according to the financial information service <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, was up 1.61 to 1,138.97. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.65 to 281.88. Among tax-exempt municipal bonds, general obligations were unchanged while dollar bonds were up \ point. Trading was moderate. Three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were down 1 basis point to a discounted rate of 6.71 percent, for a yield of 6.91 percent. Six-month bills rose 4 basis points to a discounted rate of 7.05 percent to yield 7.40 percent and one-year bills were unchanged at 7.26 percent to yield 7.77 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discounted rate is the interest rate the market uses to price bills. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 7 13-16 percent, up from 7 -RCB- percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Oregon Official Rejects Proposed Farmers Insurance Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oregon's insurance commissioner on Thursday rejected <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s attempted hostile takeover of the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Commissioner <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulongoski </PERSON> concluded that the proposed buyout by <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm of British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> would affect Farmers' policyholders adversely and be harmful to free competition in the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> insurance trade <PERSON> Kulongoski </PERSON> also cited the intention of <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, which owns a major tobacco company, to restrict the non-smoker policies sold by Farmers. The commissioner said that also would be bad for competition. <PERSON> Kulongoski </PERSON>'s order can be appealed to the courts. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> has offered about $ 4.5 billion to acquire Los Angeles-based Farmers. Farmers directors have rejected the proposal, which would require approval of insurance regulators in nine states where Farmers has units. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s insurance commissioner also has rejected the proposal, and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> has approved it. The commissioner's ruling stated the proposed acquisition `` subjects policyholders and shareholders to substantial risks while providing no benefit that Farmers does not already enjoy.'' He also said the continued denials by BAT and <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> `` of the known adverse health effects of tobacco smoking, and its stated intentions of precluding Farmers from referring to such health effects in its marketing literature, do not promote the interest of the insurance-buying public.'' <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> along with department store concerns including <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kulongoski </PERSON> said the proposed purchase would increase risks to Farmers' policyholders because of potential judgments over liability lawsuits involving tobacco products. `` In addition,'' <PERSON> Kulongoski </PERSON> said, `` there is evidence that the proposed financing of the acquisition is unworkable.'' And he said the takeover would be `` detrimental to free competition in the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> insurance marketplace.''

<HEAD>Aerospace Company Says 6 Pct. Profit Increase Due to Tax Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 6 percent profit second quarter profit increase on Thursday, but the aerospace company attributed the gain largely to lower taxes. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 106 million, or $ 1.77 per share, in the second quarter, up from $ 100 million, or $ 1.51 per share, in the same period of 1987. Sales during the quarter ended June 26 fell to $ 2.7 billion from $ 2.9 billion the year before. The per-share earnings figures for the two years are not comparable because the company has bought back some 7 million shares of its stock since the October 1987 stock market crash. Operating profit declined in the second quarter, to $ 163 million from $ 195 million, partly because <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s contract to build the C-5B military transport plane is nearing an end, the company said. Additionally, new Pentagon policies requiring contractors to pay a larger share of the cost of development contracts has reduced operating profit, the company said. Net income rose primarily because of lower tax rates, said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitchen </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive. In the first half of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> reported a profit of $ 220 million on sales of $ 5.3 billion, up from profit of $ 186 million on sales of $ 5.4 billion in the same period of 1987.
