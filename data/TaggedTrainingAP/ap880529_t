 Deep in a mangrove swamp near the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be another ancient Mexican civilization. So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four-ton stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a 19-inch-high clay figure of a fertility-rite priest. `` But,'' says <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Capitaine </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Xalapa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthropology </ORGANIZATION>, `` the finds are so promising that the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> state in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>.'' The stele was found in November 1986. It is covered with inscriptions in an unknown language but with some Mayan numerals. The priest in the clay figure is wearing the human skin of a flayed sacrificial victim. Both are about 1,800 years old. `` That would place them in the second century A.D., which is after the archaeological Olmecs, who flourished in the area from around 1050 to 500 B.C., and before the Mayas who emerged around the fourth century A.D,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said in an interview. Adding to the intrigue, the <ORGANIZATION> Mayas </ORGANIZATION> lived in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, more than 700 miles to the east, <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said at the museum in <LOCATION> Xalapa </LOCATION>, where the stele and figure are kept. `` But there are two dates on the stele in Mayan writing, in their so-called Long Count Calendar made up of dots and bars, equivalent to May 22, 143 -LRB- A.D. -RRB-, and July 13, 156 A.D.,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. If the mysterious people did exist, <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said, they also appeared to be unrelated to the other two of the four known civilizations that inhabited the gulf coast: the Totonacas, who emerged around the seventh century A.D. in the area where the artifacts were found, or the Huaxtecas farther north, about one century later. `` They could be the Xicalancas, of which <PERSON> Clavijero </PERSON> briefly talked about,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said, referring to the Rev. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Clavijero </PERSON> -LRB- 1731-1787 -RRB-, a Jesuit priest who was the first to systematically study <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s ancient languages and peoples. In his `` History of Ancient <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' Clavijero in three lines briefly mentioned the Xicalanca civilization in relation to the Olmecs, but did not go into details. In `` nahuatl,'' the trading language of the <ORGANIZATION> Aztecs </ORGANIZATION>, who came much later, <LOCATION> Xicalanca </LOCATION> means `` the people who live by the Great Body of Salt Water,'' as the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was called. The two artifacts were found within 130 feet of each other in the village of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mojarra </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Piojo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> meets the <LOCATION> Acula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The crocodile-infested region is so swampy that it can be reached only by boat, <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. La Mojarra, with a population of fewer than 200, is up the <LOCATION> Acula </LOCATION> about 20 miles south of the port of <LOCATION> Alvarado </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> state. But neither the village nor the <LOCATION> Piojo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> can be found on any map of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Carved in relief on the previously polished stele, which is of basalt, one of the world's hardest rocks, is the full length profile of a regal figure, a man about 25 years old, holding out in both hands a vessel in a gesture of offering. `` He was probably a ruler, or a chief warrior, or a high priest _ or maybe all three since that was the custom in the gulf region in ancient times,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. The figure wears ear-stops, a tall headdress adorned with four representations of something like a rain god, trimmed with eight feathers, and a breastplate full of other allegorical figures over what appears to be a pleated cotton shirt or tunic. A total of 577 glyphs, or picture-words, divided into 21 neat rows running from top to bottom, plus 33 `` elements'' like the rain-god representations, cover the rest of the slab. `` It was all carved during one continuous period,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. `` It was a single piece of work. It is the oldest and richest piece of writing found yet about this area of ancient <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' About 7 feet tall, slightly oblong and with a gently rounded top, the stele once stood on the right bank of the <LOCATION> Acula </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mojarra </LOCATION>. Over the years, erosion toppled it, and it lay in the river until a fisherman discovered it and dragged it out with the help of villagers. Archaeologists retrieved the stele, but <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said he kept the find quiet for two years so work could proceed `` without the pressure that such a discovery creates.'' The second piece, the ceramic figure of a priest made with the region's thick orange clay, has a square base. It is the only one of two artifacts from that area with a base. The other, also in the museum, is so badly damaged it can not be studied, <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. In the La Mojarra figure, only the head is missing. That type of clay figure was very popular among the four gulf cultures. The Aztecs called it in <LOCATION> Xipe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Totec </LOCATION>, or the Lord of the Flayed, and it was variously worshiped as the god of spring, of fertility, of abundance and of the metalworkers. A peasant at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mojarra </LOCATION> found the shattered figure many years ago while digging the foundations for his house and kept the pieces in a cardboard box. `` We got wind of it three weeks ago, and we convinced him to let the museum have it,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> suspects the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mojarra </LOCATION> area could have been a ceremonial site. `` If so, there surely must be more stele and artifacts to be found,'' he said.

 When the `` Albion Tornado'' roared toward <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> three years ago, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> ran to warn his wife, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, on their front porch `` when I saw the wind pick her up and throw her over the rail.'' Across the street, the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> prayed hard as the gathering winds sucked him toward a second-floor window and his strength ebbed. Next door, 5-year-old <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> screamed `` Tornado coming!'' as her father, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, huddled the family above their funeral home. In a moment of eerie silence a few seconds later, <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> knew they were in the eye of the huge twister. Forty-one tornadoes, including nine of the highest intensities, swept through <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> during eight hours of May 31, 1985, killing 88 people and injuring more than 1,000. The tornado outbreak, worst since April 1975, caused $ 450 million in property damage in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Of the dead, 62 were killed in their houses or mobile homes and a disproportionate number, 15, were between 66 and 70 years old, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The Albion tornado was among the worst, packing winds estimated at up to 260 miles per hour as it fell upon farmland on the <LOCATION> Ohio-Pennsylvania </LOCATION> border. The twister, estimated at 1,200 feet across, quickly moved northeast through this pleasant crossroads town near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> on a 14-mile tear that killed 12 people. `` I watch the sky now, just like everyone else,'' Mayor <PERSON> Bonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahlin </PERSON> said recently. `` Tornadoes were <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> kind of things. But I do n't think it's something we'll ever forget.'' `` People here still cringe the minute there's a dark cloud in the sky. There's such anticipation,'' said Borough Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 72, a retired railroad worker, heard the first frantic warnings on the police scanner and ran to the door to see his wife get swept away. He woke up trapped in his own house. `` I started hollering,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> recalled. `` There were timbers all over me. The beams were across my legs and I could n't move. They tried to jack up the beams, but that just put more pressure on my legs. Then they got a chain saw and cut the beams in half and pulled me out.'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> suffered only cuts and bruises. His wife suffered broken arms and a dislocated shoulder. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, 68, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was in his rectory's living room `` when the roof went off and the windows went out.'' `` I kind of spread-eagled in front of the window as the thing began to suck me out. I grabbed anything. I just hung on until it ended,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. `` I asked God to make it that I was ready to meet Him.'' The church and rectory were destroyed, but two days later <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said Mass under a tarpaulin in the ruins. <PERSON> Steff </PERSON>, 43, a mortician, gathered his wife, four daughters and a friend in the family room of their second-floor apartment. <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> screamed just as <ORGANIZATION> Albion </ORGANIZATION>'s fire siren began to wail. `` Then something hit the house and we all got into the bathroom. Things just bombarded the building,'' <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> recalled. `` Then we heard a silence, just for a second, like in the eye of a hurricane. Then everything hit us from the other side. <PERSON> Patty </PERSON>, my wife, opened the door of the family room and it was gone.'' The Steffs' business and home were destroyed, a $ 200,000 loss. <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> ran across the street to help free <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> from her three-story Victorian house, which was down. `` I called into the debris to tell her help was coming,'' <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> said. `` Later, she told me she was never so glad to hear an undertaker's voice.'' A deputy Erie County coroner, <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> helped set up a morgue at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. They brought in 11 bodies. Today, the tornado's southwest-to-northeast path can be clearly seen in rebuilt split-level houses and new mobile homes, grassy lots and sharply pruned oak trees that make the east side of <LOCATION> Albion </LOCATION> look like a new subdivision. It was only a few months ago, <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said, that he `` closed the books'' on <ORGANIZATION> Albion </ORGANIZATION>'s claims with federal and state disaster officials. Mayor <PERSON> Dahlin </PERSON> estimated that fewer than 200 of the town's 1,800 people moved away after the tornado `` because of memories, lack of money or whatever.'' `` People are getting on with their lives,'' she said. `` Businesses are being rebuilt, changing hands, and there are new ones.'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s modern new 400-seat church is linked by a glass breezeway to a new three-bedroom rectory. Behind, a new recreation building stands in red brick. The complex cost $ 1.1 million, he said. `` One of the greatest experiences of my life, as tragic as it was, was to see the spirit of the people of this town. They took a tragic blow. They rebuilt the town,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. `` It's almost profane to say it was a good thing, but the bottom line is that the community is stronger and closer knit and the town is even physically better with all the new construction,'' he said. The Steffs, fully insured, rebuilt their small funeral home with two viewing rooms, but took the opportunity to move their living quarters to a house in another part of town. `` We shed our tears over it. We're trying to get our lives together. You can dwell on the negatives, but the positives are the concern and the love of the community,'' <PERSON> Steff </PERSON> said. `` When I walked out the door that day, I knew I was going to stay.'' The Rices built a modern two-bedroom split-level house. `` It's starting to feel like home,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said with a shrug `` You still think about it. Last September, I had an operation for cancer and when I was in the recovery room, I thought I was still under the house,'' he said. `` I do n't want to see another one.''

<TEXT>
 At times, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> sounds too much like a reformer to be the presidential candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has governed <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1929. The 40-year-old candidate preaches democratic reforms and clean elections as he campaigns not so much for the office, which he is certain to win, but to regain his party's lost credibility. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, whose thick black moustache and balding head feature prominently in political cartoons, is described by those close to him as a pragmatist, influenced strongly by his <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> education. Before his nomination last fall as a candidate in the July 6 election, he was President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>'s budget and planning secretary, a key figure in developing the economic austerity programs that have prevailed in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1982. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> has strong family ties to the northern state of <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION>, home to political conservatives who oppose the guided economy and government controls dear to governing party ideologues in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Some foes within the party felt <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> would be identified too strongly with the business sector and with conservative groups within the party. But this has worked to the party's advantage. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> has managed to bring private business back into the party fold by advocating fewer government controls and urging business leaders to join the government `` in the battle for world markets.'' `` The time is past when the state was the instrument to solve all of society's problems,'' he told a cheering crowd at a recent meeting of business leaders in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nuevo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>'s capital. He also wants more foreign investment to `` modernize <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> technologically.'' `` What he says agrees with what private business thinks <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> must be,'' said <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Legorreta </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Mexican business traditionally has identified with the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, although it must maintain a close relationship with government agencies. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> speaks confidently of the resurgence of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The country has a $ 105 billion foreign debt but has renegotiated it and is keeping up payments. Last month in <LOCATION> Puebla </LOCATION>, a politically conservative state in central <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> de Gortari upset some party officials with his call for reforms. `` The citizens' vote must be respected,'' he said. `` The party will defend its victories, but it must accept its defeats.'' He also promised reforms to encourage more independent judiciary and legislative branches. `` Let us lead the democratic reform the country demands,'' he stated. The political reforms may be difficult because they imply the acceptance by the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> of electoral losses and the consequent loss of power of local or regional party bosses. The party never has lost a presidential election or gubernatorial race in any of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 31 states since its founding. It is generally conceded in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> that the governing party wins elections, but it often is criticized for `` winning'' by more than the necessary votes _ by stuffing ballots to claim overwhelming victories. `` There is a great internal debate going on now,'' said a source close to the candidate. `` <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> is demanding elections free of fraud and there is a lot of pressure being put on local party leaders to be more democratic.'' This year, with the country in the middle of a serious economic crisis, and an increasingly vociferous opposition that includes a dissident group led by former party leaders, those close to <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> believe reforms have a good chance in his six-year term. `` It is better in the long run to win by a small margin than to announce we won by a large margin and lose all credibility,'' said a source in <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' entourage during a recent campaign trip. Some <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> officials privately admit the party may even lose a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, something that has never happened before. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> won the elections in 1982 for the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> with an official 71 percent of the vote, a figure many considered exaggerated. <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> officials now predict <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> may win the July 6 election with a more realistic 55 percent to 60 percent of the votes. `` We do not know if he will have the freedom to do what he wants to do,'' said <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Junco </PERSON>, publisher of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> and a frequent government critic. `` But we are condemned to be optimistic evey six years.''

 First her married name was chiseled off her tombstone three times. Later the stone vanished, and so did its replacement. Even in death, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Plath </PERSON> is not at peace. The admired American poet lies in an unmarked grave high in the <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> hills, a bleak resting place for a tormented soul who killed herself when she was 30. Nobody knows who is tampering with her grave, but some suspect feminist activists of erasing `` Hughes'' from the stone in the belief that <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>'s marriage to British poet <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> contributed to her misery by turning her into a housewife. <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>'s reputation has grown since her suicide in 1963. `` The Bell Jar,'' her semi-autobiographical novel, has sold 200,000 copies in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. She posthumously won the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for her `` Collected Poems.'' Her grave in <LOCATION> Heptonstall </LOCATION>, a clutch of stone houses in the austere south <LOCATION> Pennine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> hills </LOCATION>, has become a place of pilgrimage. A little rosebush grows on it, and some modest wreaths and cut flowers lie about. Crows and magpies fly above. A large granite tombstone once stood on the grave, inscribed, `` In Memory. <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Plath </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. 1932-1963.'' Below were two lines of poetry: `` Even amidst fierce flames The golden lotus can be planted.'' They were written by <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, now <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Poet Laureate. He was estranged from his wife she gassed herself in their <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> apartment Feb. 11, 1963. In February of last year, residents say two women were seen picking the lead letters of the <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> name off the tombstone. They said the name had been removed twice before. The stone then disappeared. `` We get visitors from all over the world to see the grave, and they come in to say they ca n't find it. It seems a shame,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Parish </PERSON>, who runs the newspaper shop. `` I think feminists interfered with the inscription because they object to the addition of <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' name to <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>'s,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, a local teacher. `` Some people think <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> was somehow to blame in his wife's death because he left her to cope with the children,'' Miss <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> said She said a local newspaper had reported the tombstone was removed for restoration. `` But that was hardly true as only the one name had been picked off, and the tombstone was never returned,'' she said. The question of feminist involvement was raised again after the publication this year of `` <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>,'' a biography by <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner-Martin </PERSON>, professor of English at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 57, was reportedly furious with <PERSON> Wagner-Martin </PERSON> for writing that he left his wife to do the housework and raise the couple's two children while he pursued his career. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> was recognized as a fine poet when he married <PERSON> Plath </PERSON> after they met in 1956 at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and critics say his influence deepened his wife's poetic creativeness. The poet, who remarried 18 years ago, never talks to the media, and his sister <PERSON> Olwyn </PERSON>, who sometimes speaks for him, did not return phone calls. The Sunday Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> reported in March that <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> sent it a 15-page rebuttal of <PERSON> Wagner-Martin </PERSON>'s book after reading an early draft of it. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> conceded that <PERSON> Plath </PERSON> may have resented his `` comparative freedom'' but insisted that to suggest she was jealous of his poetic ability would be `` a major misjudgment of her character,'' the paper said. <PERSON> Wagner-Martin </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that she felt <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> was not sensitive enough to his wife's needs in the last months of their marriage. `` I saw her daily calendar of the things she had to do, like mowing, cooking and shopping, and there was no suggestion that <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> was going to help with them,'' the professor said. However, critic <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kermode </PERSON>, reviewing the biography in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, wrote: `` Surely the enemies she had to deal with were n't housewifely duties and the selfishness of men, but interior demons much more terrible.'' <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>'s best-known poems dealt with illness, suffering and death _ she had already survived a suicide attempt at age 20. She is buried near <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' parents outside the churchyard wall of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> the Apostle. `` I was told that it took some pressure to get a tombstone and it was only put on her grave five or six years after the burial,'' <PERSON> Wagner-Martin </PERSON> said. `` I have no idea who interfered with the stone and the grave, but I am sure it is not the people of <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION>.'' Villager <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Eveleigh </PERSON>, 76, a retired engineer and admirer of <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>'s poetry, said he made a border of little stones around the grave when the tombstone disappeared. `` I also got larger stones and scratched or painted the name of <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Plath </PERSON> on them so the grave could be identified by visitors, but those were taken away, eight times altogether,'' he said. <PERSON> Eveleigh </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> said she tried to discover who was responsible for the grave. `` I could n't find out, and it seemed the church authorities were being evasive,'' she said, adding: `` I presume it's up to <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>.'' The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, vicar of <LOCATION> Heptonstall </LOCATION>, confirmed that the <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> family was responsible for the upkeep of the grave. `` The gravestone was removed last year because of vandalism. I have no idea if the stone is going to be replaced,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> toured <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> churches Sunday, holding hands and dismissing their reported feuds as `` rumors,'' but when talk turned to religious activities, the Soviet first lady abruptly cut the conversation short. While President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> squared off over human rights inside the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s Great Palace, the two women wore smiles and strolled hand-in-hand toward the cameras in an attempt to put to rest the stories about the tense relationship that emerged from their last meeting at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit. `` We've gotten along very well every other time,'' a smiling Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in response to queries about the supposed frosty relationship. The Soviet first lady, true to the forthright style she displayed at the White House, chimed in at length and insisted that she considered such reports frivolous. `` Rumors have it, and there was a question, that there is some misunderstanding between myself and the -LRB- president's -RRB- wife,'' she replied through an interpreter. `` ... I would like to say, I think it's not serious.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said her contacts with Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have been part of the on-going improvement in relations between the two superpowers. `` We do have a lot to talk about and we are going to have something to remember, which is very important. I welcome Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> here and the president to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' she said. At one point, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked whether former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> incorrectly portrayed her in his book as having asked, after an extended dinner lecture from Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, `` Who does that dame think she is?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, with an icy stare, replied curtly, `` Yes.'' Even though the two women offered nearly constant smiles, the first lady did display a bit of the impatience she'd shown during the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit as Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> maintained an extensive dialogue with the press corps. During a tour of the Kremlin's sun-splashed Cathedral Square and its ancient, golden-domed stone churches, the two first ladies were often shoulder-to-shoulder, pointing at the sights and talking through interpreters abot the fortress' collection of buildings that served as the residence, places of worship and tombs of the Czars. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, attired in a fitted, winter white wool suit and dark suede high heels, repeatedly patted the back of her neck to smooth her closely-cropped red hair. On her left shoulder, she wore a gold and green-stone firebird, a famous figure in Russian fairy tales. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wore a black-and-white checked Oscar de la Renta two-piece suit, complete with black patent heels and purse and white pique bowed blouse, all set off by a matching set of gold and black bracelets, sparling earrings and a large stone ring. The Soviet first lady quickly took charge of the tour as she put her arm about Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s waist and guided her about the inside the 14th century Cathedral of the Assumption, the largest and one of the oldest churches-turned muesums in the Kremlin. The vaulted stone church, crowned with five gilded domes, has 40-foot high walls covered with a rich collection of priceless paintings and icons that show scenes from the life of Christ and the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. It is the repository of the finest and most revered icons in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, some dating from the 12th century, brought to the church and restored. After they entered the Cathedral, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was asked about what she wanted to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people about what the summit should produce. `` Peace and friendship and that they understand the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people,'' she replied. Asked what else, the former university lecturer shot back, `` What do you mean, what else? That's the most important thing. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, appearing a bit bewildered, was asked her impressions of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` Wonderful, very exciting, it's a little overwhelming,'' she replied, eyes wide and blinking. At that point, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> interrupted, insisting, `` Please, I beg you, allow us to see the cathedral.'' The Soviet first lady then guided Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from reporters and launched into a lecture about the religious paintings that adorned the golden wall that divides the church sanctuary from its main hall. As they reached one icon depicting a sorrowful Virgin and the infant <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> touching the mother's cheek, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> remarked that it was one of the most beloved images in the nation. `` Very, very, very maternal,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> remarked. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> then turned from Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and towards the interpreter, asking, `` Now let me finish,'' and she queried whether the cathedral was used mainly as a museum or for religious activities. `` Nyet,'' responded Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, to which the first lady quickly replied, `` Oh, yes, nyet, the word ` nyet,' that I understand.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> then added that there had been no religious observances in the Cathedral since 1918, but the interpreter apparently corrected the date to 1917. `` It has obviously a very religious feeling,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, softly of the paintings. She then turned to Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and asked if it were true that a concert was planned for the cathedral during next month's celebration of the millenium, the observance of the 1,000-year anniversary of the spread of <LOCATION> Christendom </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. `` Nyet,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> replied curtly, putting her arm around Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s waist, briskly guiding her out the door and jumping into a discussion of icons, frescoes, and wood carvings _ out of reporters' earshot. According to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, the two women held hands again as they took a walk along the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> embankment that overlooks the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Spectators applauded the two women as they strolled about the cobblestone square, and they then retired to the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, where they had tea. Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said the two discussed the supposed feud, and she quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying, `` All these rumors are trivial stories.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> then replied, speaking of the media, `` Yes, but you ca n't get them to change their minds. I've told them so many times that the rumors are not true,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> quoted her as saying. The two ladies agreed that what was important was their husbands' work and the change in relations between their two nations, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said.

 A drowning, a missing swimmer, and a boating accident that killed two people, injured five and left two men missing and presumed dead marked this seaside resort's Memorial Day weekend. Searches continued until Sunday night for a missing 16-year-old boy who apparently was caught by undertow Saturday afternoon, and for two men still missing from the boating accident late Saturday night, authorities said. One woman was killed when an 19-foot boat carrying seven passengers plowed into an anchored, 25-foot boat with two aboard about a quarter-mile north of <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The seven were ejected into the water and none was wearing a lifejacket, authorities said. Searchers found the body of a second victim around 8 p.m. Sunday about 300 yards from the collision site, officers said. The two men still missing were presumed dead, officials said. `` Most of the injuries seem to be impact injuries,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloxom </PERSON> of the Natural Resources Police. `` And there's a possibility some of them might not have known how to swim. Authorities would give no further details other than that a 23-year-old <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> woman died at the scene and five people were taken to hospitals. The names of all nine people were withheld until relatives were notified. Authorities confiscated both boats, but issued no citations pending completion of the investigation. The 16-year-old <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> boy was reported missing Saturday afternoon after he and a friend went swimming and were caught in the undertow. The friend reached shore and alerted lifeguards. A search by <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police, the beach patrol, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and a state police helicopter Saturday turned up no trace of the youth, whose name was not released. Around 8:30 a.m. Saturday, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinkleman </PERSON>, 28, of <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnie </PERSON>, apparently drowned in the surf, 90 minutes before lifeguards went on duty for the first time in the beach season, police said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> plans to build an experimental rocket that would be dropped from a B-52 bomber and used to launch military satellites into space, a newspaper reported Sunday. The three-stage, winged rocket would be dropped about seven miles above the earth and then blast into space, placing payloads of up to 600 pounds into orbit, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported, quoting government and industry experts. Officials have said they hope a prototype will fly next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> wants to test the rocket for a program designed to develop light-weight satellites and launchers for various military uses, including spy and communication satellites. The experimental rocket is being pursued by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which develops futuristic projects for the Pentagon. There is concern on Capitol Hill that the rocket could be launched in secrecy, the Times reported. Although there is an agreement requiring space-faring countries to notify the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> of all payloads going into orbit, the rocket could be fired from remote parts of the world, far from Soviet trawlers and spy satellites that monitor military launchings from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Pentagon has given no indication that it would violate the treaty obligation, but some military officials say privately that it would be useful for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to have the option of quick, secret launchings in the event of war. The Lightsat program, which includes the rocket, is part of a five-year, $ 240 million effort. On May 13, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> signed a letter of contractual intent with <ORGANIZATION> Orbital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> to buy one test rocket, with an option for five more, industry sources say. <ORGANIZATION> Orbital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> would be joined by <ORGANIZATION> Hercules </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> which makes solid-fuel rockets. The three-stage, solid-fuel rocket would weigh 15 tons and measure 50 feet in length. Proponents say the air-launched rocket system would be inexpensive, less vulnerable to attack than ground-based spaceports and ideal for quickly launching small spy satellites to monitor fast-moving battles. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Latham </PERSON>, a former assistant secretary of defense, said: `` The nation looked into air-launched rockets 20 years ago and found them wanting. There are better ways to make systems low cost and survivable.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> becomes the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leader in 14 years to step foot on Soviet soil Sunday, carrying the only superpower treaty to ban an entire class of nuclear weapons. But the summit was clouded by uncertainties that developed Saturday, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said prospects had faded for signing three secondary arms agreements and the Soviets harshly criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Afghan rebels. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> were scheduled to board Air Force One midmorning for a 90-minute flight to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the president's fourth summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> The couple planned to bid farewell to Finnish President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> and his wife, Tellervo, at an airport ceremony. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> spent three days in this Baltic capital recuperating from jet lag and preparing for their historic five-day visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> on an overnight flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, bringing with him the newly ratified Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty -LRB- INF -RRB-. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> carried two bulging briefcases into the VIP lounge at the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> airport, where he waited to link up with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the flight to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will exchange ratification documents during a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ceremony Wednesday morning. It is the first ratified superpower arms treaty in 16 years, the first major arms control agreement of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the only treaty to ban an entire class of nuclear weapons. The exchange ceremony substitutes for the previously hoped-for signing of an agreement slashing by half the arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons _ the most powerful and dangerous in the superpower arsenals. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was described Saturday by his national security adviser Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> as `` well rested,'' and looking forward to his first session with the general secretary, scheduled withing an hour of the president's arrival. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> arranged to greet their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> guests in the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s 200-foot long St. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s Hall, a gilded and marble reception room on the second floor of the former residence of the Czars. As the first ladies planned an afternoon tour of the fortress' collection of churches, apartments and bell towers, the two men were scheduled to meet over a table in the Hall of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> at the west end of the palace The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 93-5 on Friday to approve the INF treaty, signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> December summit. In a rare televised session, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s collective presidency unanimously ratified the pact 17 hours later. A Soviet government spokesman described the action as `` a very good prelude'' to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit. But in a pre-summit snag, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials revealed that chances had evaporated for signing an agreement on advance notification of ballistic missile tests by the superpowers. And they said two lesser arms-control measures may not be ready for signing during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The agreements, while not major, would have given the leaders grounds to boast of progress on arms control issues _ particularly in view of the failure of the superpowers to conclude a treaty to curb strategic nuclear weapons. Aside from the arms agenda, officials said they did not expect `` announceable progress'' on differences on human rights and regional disputes. Asked by reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about problems with the secondary arms agreements, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said `` nothing will seriously detract'' from the importance of the summit meeting. Soviet officials, meanwhile, criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for its insistence on sending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Afghan rebels after the withdrawal of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops. And they hinted they might halt their withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> if neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> failed to stop aiding Afghan rebels. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement, carried by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency and the evening news show Vremya, took aim at the `` lavish supplies of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, intended specifically for the anti-government Afghan forces.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been supplying Afghan rebels with an estimated $ 500 million annually in arms and other military supplies channeled through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. It has pledged to continue to do so as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> keeps up its military support of the Afghan government. Asked about the Soviet comments, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters, `` The relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is complex and spans many issues. A single summit or four summits, as we've had now, is n't going to solve them all at one time. The general relationship is better and I think prospects for general peace are improved.'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> was the last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, traveling to the port of <LOCATION> Vladivostock </LOCATION>, located on the Sea of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in 1974. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> met the same year in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with the late <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in an interview with Soviet television broadcast over the weekend throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said he could not have envisioned a trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> under the Soviet leadership before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Very frankly, I have to say I think there is a difference between this general secretary and other leaders of your country ... I do n't think they had any dreams of perestroika'' _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program to restructure the nation's troubled economy.

 Here is the statement by Soviet Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> welcoming President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>: Esteemed Mr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, esteemed Mrs. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on behalf of the people and government of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, I extend to you my sincere greetings on the occasion of your visit. Welcome. It is now almost six months since our meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which went down in history as a major milestone in Soviet-American and international relations. Now on this return trip, you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, have traversed the great distance that lies between our two capitals to continue our dialogue. This is a fact we duly appreciate. As this is our fourth meeting, we can already make some meaningful assessments. As we see it, long-held dislikes have been weakened, habitual stereotypes stemming from enemy images have been shaken loose. The human features of the other nation are now more clearly visible. This in itself is important, for at the turn of the two millenniums history has objectively bound our two countries by a common responsibility for the destinies of mankind. The peoples of the world and, in the first place the Soviet and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, welcome the emerging, positive changes in our relationship and hope that your visit and talks here will be productive, providing a fresh impetus in all areas of dialogue and interaction between our two great nations. You and I are conscious of our two peoples' longing for mutual understanding, cooperation and a safe and stable world. This makes it incumbent on us to discuss constructively the main aspects of disarmament. The set of issues related to 50 percent cuts in strategic offensive arms while preserving the 1972 ABM treaty, problems of eliminating chemical weapons, reductions in armed forces and conventional armaments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, cessation of nuclear testing. The world is also looking to us, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, for responsible judgments on other complex issues of today, such as the settlement of regional conflicts, improving international economic relations, promoting development, overcoming backwardness, poverty and mass diseases, and humanitarian problems. And of course we shall discuss bilateral relations. Our previous meetings have showed that constructive Soviet-U.S. relations are possible. The treaty on intermediate and shorter range missiles is the most impressive symbol of that. But even more important and complex problems lie ahead of that. And so, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, you and I still have a lot of work to do and it is good when there's a lot of work to be done and people need that work. We are ready to do our utmost in these coming days in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Mr. President, you and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are here on your first visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a country which you have so often mentioned in your statements. Aware of your interest in Russian proverbs, let me add another one to your collection: It is better to see once than to hear a hundred times. Let me assure you that you can look forward to hospitality, warmth and good will. You will have many meetings with Soviet people. They have a centuries-old history behind them. They love their land and take pride in their accomplishments. They resent things that are presently standing in their way and they are heatedly discussing how their country can best progress. They are full of plans for the future. Being ardent patriots, Soviet people are open to friendship and cooperation with all nations. They harbor sincere respect for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and want good relations with your country. Here within the walls of the ancient Kremlin, where one feels the touch of history, people are moved to reflect over the diversity and greatness of human civilization. So may this give greater historical depth to the Soviet-American talks to be held here, infusing them with a sense of mankind's shared destinies. Once again, I bid you welcome.

There has always been speculation the prelate came from a communist country. In all, the new cardinals come from 18 countries and include several Vatican-based officials. Among them are Archbishop <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvestrini </PERSON>, who is equivalent to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s foreign minister; Archbishop <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Javierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortas </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, and Archbishop <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, prefect of the papal household.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> opened their historic summit Sunday with an exchange of Russian proverbs and a vow to continue the work begun 2 -LCB- years ago in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` We both know it wo n't be easy,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Not long after the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> arrived by motorcade from <LOCATION> Vnukovo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, they walked across a long red carpet to the center of a 200-foot-long chandaliered and gilded reception room in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, where their paths crossed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s and his wife's. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reminisced briefly about earlier summits in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, while their wives, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, looked on in an inside-the-Kremlin scene broadcast live by Soviet television and seen by millions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and around the world. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who once called the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an `` evil empire,'' had arrived on Soviet soil for the first time, under sunny skies, just after 2 p.m. local time. He was greeted there by Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, for years the foreign minister, and <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Lidia </PERSON>, who gave a bouquet of roses to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Amid mixed expectations about the success of the five days of talks, coming in the wake of problems with secondary arms-control measures and new Soviet complaints of continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Afghan rebels, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> set a conciliatory tone, telling <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that `` important tasks lie ahead.'' `` You and I are conscious of our two people's longing for mutual understanding, cooperation and a safe world,'' said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter. `` This makes it incumbent upon us to discuss ... the major aspects of disarmament.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told his Soviet counterpart that U.S.-Soviet relations have improved since their first meeting, in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in November 1985, saying `` we have taken our work, step by step, and I have come here to continue that work.'' Inside the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seemed to gently tweak <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> about the president's many speeches and jokes about life in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Mr. President, you and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are here on your first visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a country which you have so often mentioned in your public statements ... Let me add another to your collection, ` It is better to see once than to hear a hundred times.''' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had his own proverb for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Speaking of the gradual progress in superpower relations over recent years, and noting that differences remain, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, speaking first in Russian, told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>: `` Rodilsya, ne toropilsya,'' or `` It was born. It was n't rushed.'' `` Mr. General Secretary, we did not rush. We have taken our work step by step, and I have come here to continue that work. We both know it will not be easy.'' Sitting down with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for a picture-taking session at the outset of their first meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked whether he intended to lecture the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader about human rights. `` I have no intention of trying to be a teacher,'' he replied. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> spent three days in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, recuperating from jet lag and preparing for their historic five-day visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Reporters shouted questions as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> posed briefly with <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and other members of the arrival party here. `` We're getting along just fine,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. As reporters continued to yell questions, <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and said, `` They want to know in advance everything. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> then shook hands with a host of dignitaries, including <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, currently the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and paused briefly while standing under the Soviet flag bearing the hammer and sickle. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stood before march Soviet troops, swinging their legs in the traditional Russaian military goose-step fashion. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> on an overnight flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, bringing with him the newly ratified Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty -LRB- INF -RRB-. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> carried two bulging briefcases into the VIP lounge at the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> airport, where he waited to link up with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the flight to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will exchange ratification documents during a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ceremony Wednesday morning. It is the first ratified superpower arms treaty in 16 years, the first major arms control agreement of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the only treaty to ban an entire class of nuclear weapons. The exchange ceremony substitutes for the previously hoped-for signing of an agreement slashing by half the arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons _ the most powerful and dangerous in the superpower arsenals. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 93-5 on Friday to approve the INF treaty, signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> December summit. In a rare televised session, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s collective presidency unanimously ratified the pact 17 hours later. In a pre-summit snag, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials revealed that chances had evaporated for signing an agreement on advance notification of ballistic missile tests by the superpowers. And they said two lesser arms-control measures may not be ready for signing during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The agreements, while not major, would have given the leaders grounds to boast of progress on arms control issues _ particularly in view of the failure of the superpowers to conclude a treaty to curb strategic nuclear weapons. Aside from the arms agenda, officials said they did not expect `` announceable progress'' on differences on human rights and regional disputes. Soviet officials, meanwhile, criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for its insistence on sending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Afghan rebels after the withdrawal of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops. And they hinted they might halt their withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> if neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> failed to stop aiding Afghan rebels. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement, carried by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency and the evening news show Vremya, took aim at the `` lavish supplies of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, intended specifically for the anti-government Afghan forces.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been supplying Afghan rebels with an estimated $ 500 million annually in arms and other military supplies channeled through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. It has pledged to continue to do so as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> keeps up its military support of the Afghan government. Asked about the Soviet comments, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters, `` The relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is complex and spans many issues. A single summit or four summits, as we've had now, is n't going to solve them all at one time. The general relationship is better and I think prospects for general peace are improved.'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> was the last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, traveling to the port of <LOCATION> Vladivostock </LOCATION>, located on the Sea of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in 1974. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> met the same year in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with the late <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in an interview with Soviet television broadcast over the weekend throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said he could not have envisioned a trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> under the Soviet leadership before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Very frankly, I have to say I think there is a difference between this general secretary and other leaders of your country ... I do n't think they had any dreams of perestroika'' _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program to restructure the nation's troubled economy.

 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement Sunday at the opening of his summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> Mr. General Secretary, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Mr. General Secretary, thank you for those kind words of welcome. We've traveled a long road together to reach this moment, from our first meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in November 1985 when I invited you to visit me in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and you invited me to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It was cold that day in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and even colder in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> when we met the following year to work on the preparations for our exchange of visits. We faced great obstacles, but by the time of your visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December, although we still had to grapple with difficult issues, we had achieved impressive progress in all the areas of our common agenda, human rights, regional issues, arms reduction and our bilateral relations. We signed a treaty that will reduce the level of nuclear arms for the first time in history by eliminating an entire class of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet independent range missiles. We agreed on the main points of a treaty that will cut in half our arsenals of strategic offensive nuclear arms. We agreed to conduct a joint experiment that would allow us to develop effective ways to verify limits on nuclear testing. We held full and frank discussions and planted the seeds for future progress. It is almost summer and some of those seeds are beginning to bear fruit thanks to the hard work we have both done since our last meeting, including monthly meetings of our foreign ministers and the first meeting of our defense ministers. We have signed the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords providing for the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the first withdrawals have begun. We and our allies have completed technical arrangements necessary to begin implementing the INF treaty as soon as it enters into force. For the next major step in arms control, reductions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic offense arsenals, our negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> have produced hundreds of pages of joint draft treaty text, recording our areas of agreement as well as those issues still to be resolved. Our new nuclear risk reduction centers have begun their transmissions of routine notifications to reduce the risk of conflict. Our scientists are installing the equipment for our joint experiment to verify limits on nuclear testing. Our experts have held broad-ranging discussions on human rights and important steps have been taken in that area. We have greatly expanded our bilateral exchanges since we signed our agreement in 1985. I hope you'll agree with me that more of our young people need to participate in these exchanges, which can do so much to lay the basis for mutual understanding in the next generation. I could go on. The list of accomplishments goes far beyond what many anticipated. But I think the message is clear: Despite clear and fundamental differences and despite the frustrations that we have encountered, our work has begun to produce results. In the past, Mr. General Secretary, you've taken note of my liking for Russian proverbs. And so as not to disappoint anyone on this visit, I thought I would mention a literary saying from your past, another example of your peoples' succinct wisdom. `` Rodilsya, ne Toropilsya'' _ It was born, it was n't rushed. Mr. General Secretary, we did not rush. We have taken our work step by step, and I have come here to continue that work. We both know it will not be easy, we both know it will not be easy. We both know there are tremendous hurdles yet to be overcome. But we also know that it can be done because we share a common goal, strengthening the framework we have already begun to build for a relationship that we can sustain over the long term, a relationship that will bring genuine benefits to our own peoples and to the world. Thank you and God bless you.

<TEXT>
 After paying tribute to the nation's war dead in a traditional Memorial Day ceremony, a brass band will wend its way through a pioneer cemetery Monday to salute a 19th century madam called `` the hooker with the heart of gold.'' `` It's tongue-in-cheek,'' said ceremony chairman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McNichols </PERSON>. `` It's certainly not a part of the formal program.'' <ORGANIZATION> McNichols </ORGANIZATION>' mother for years brought a yellow rose to mark <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s grave as part of a tradition begun by those who had benefited from the madam's charitable donations. <ORGANIZATION> McNichols </ORGANIZATION> and several friends rekindled interest in the generous woman he calls a `` soiled dove.'' The Prospect Hill Preservation Brass Band has played in her memory each Memorial Day since 1980. The 25-piece band will visit Miss <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s grave after the traditional Memorial Day observance at Prospect Hill Cemetery, which sits on a hill near the old <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trail </LOCATION> where thousands of pioneers pushed their way west past <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> ran the city's highest-priced house of ill-repute for about 30 years. She retired from the business in the mid-1890s, investing her money in real estate. Miss <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> died in 1911, soon after giving her former house of prostitution to the city for use as a hospital. Her will left an estate valued at $ 1 million to be divided among the city, hospitals, a mission, children's charities and the cemetery. The madam-turned-philanthropist is buried among some of the leading citizens of her time _ judges, doctors, politicians, ministers and brewery barons. `` Everybody that was anybody is buried in that cemetery,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON>, president of the cemetery foundation. Details are sparse on the early life of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, born the daughter of a Baptist minister in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in 1835. She achieved notoriety soon after arriving in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> in 1867, the year <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> became a state. `` The first territorial capitol was between <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Farnam </LOCATION> on Ninth Street, and <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s establishment was right around the corner from it,'' <ORGANIZATION> McNichols </ORGANIZATION> said. Miss <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> met riverboat gambler <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> in 1871. They lived together, unmarried, until he died 1884, and they are buried side-by-side under a large stone slab. The <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> house of prostitution was one of several in the city's old red-light district, a few blocks from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> adjacent to what is now downtown <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>.

 It's 2 a.m. in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> ought to be asleep, but he is n't. He's taping the evening news for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. In daylight hours, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> wanders around the Hotel Rossiya with shirttail out; <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuralt </PERSON> dashes upstairs to file a story; columnist <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> looks despairingly for the <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> studio so he can interview Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. And the gofers _ go for this, go for that _ are everywhere. Like invading armies, the television networks have moved in, bringing an entourage of hundreds and a mountain of high-technology. Their beachhead is the Hotel Rossiya overlooking Red Square and the Kremlin. And the toughest negotiations of the summit may have preceded President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arrival here Sunday. The networks convinced Soviet authorities to improve the lighting of Red Square for a backdrop on the evening newscasts. Virtually every big-name network personality is vying for summit air time. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> wants to put the summit in the context of changes under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> did some man-on-the-street interviews; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has the only terrace anchor station, and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> is the only network shown in Soviet hotels. The networks have brought their own satellite dishes, microwave transmissions, walkie-talkies, telephones, electrical generators, copying machines, Fax machines _ and, in some cases, shipped in their food. `` Be Careful _ Radio Radiation,'' reads a sign in front of three giant satellite dishes outside the Rossiya. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> offered to provide its staff with smoke alarms at the <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>, a 3,000-room hotel where more than 30 people were killed in a fatal fire in 1977. It even has a daily newsletter for its people, entitled `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Newsletter.'' Uniformed Soviet officials pace up and down the Rossiya's halls, where rooms are packed with televisions, monitors and other gear. On the fifth floor, the networks built outdoor booths so reporters can conduct interviews with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> wall and St. Basil's Cathedral as a backdrop <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to broadcast its Nightly News live, while <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> plan something called `` tape live,'' which provides a slight delay. That's the middle of the night <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time. Thus the lighting of St. Basil's took on added import for the networks. They entered into negotiations with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city officials and <PERSON> Gostelradio </PERSON>, the Soviet broadcast network, and the lighting crisis was resolved satisfactorily, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>, executive director at <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. Each network has about 100 people in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, including Russian-speaking <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students who have been recruited to serve as everything from office gofers to interpreters. But for all the trouble and expense, network executives say serious summit scoops may be difficult to come by in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where bureaucrats and officials are n't as sensitive to the demands of television. `` They are less responsive in terms of time,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> executive producer. Added <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> executive producer Lane Vernardos: `` When in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, do as the Romans do does not work for television.'' With their own technology, television is able to transmit directly to a satellite, and then back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are independent of the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said. But while the American broadcasters, along with their European and Japanese counterparts, have tried to stay clear of the Soviets, network executives say the people at <LOCATION> Gostelradio </LOCATION> have given them unprecedented leeway. `` They really want to cooperate and they are trying to be flexible,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON>. Television reporters say the Soviets essentially have kept to their pre-summit pledge that journalists `` can talk to anybody they wish.'' They've interviewed dissidents, took trips outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by train and talked with students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are more willing to talk about more than they have been before,'' Rather said. No one wants to say how much money they're spending on the summit, but <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bettag </PERSON>, a CBS producer for the nightly news, thinks it's going to be worth it. `` We've made a heavy commitment because other news is likely to be slight,'' he said. `` Congress is on the Memorial Day vacation, and there is a hole before the primaries so it will be extremely quiet back home.''

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Denounce Vietnamese Withdrawal from Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas denounced as `` stinking and deceitful'' an announcement by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> that it would pull 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> this year, according to a broadcast made available Sunday. A communique released Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> military command said <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> actually was shifting its troops around <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in a frantic attempt to counter escalating guerrilla attacks. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978, is fighting a coalition of three resistance groups including the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, it announced a partial pullout of 50,000 troops to be followed by a total withdrawal in 1990. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it has made annual withdrawals since 1982, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the only genuine pullout was in November, when 20,000 troops were withdrawn. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> estimates <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> still has 120,000 to 125,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and says the other troop movements were only rotations. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the pro-Hanoi regime in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> said better security in the country made possible the Vietnamese reduction scheduled to begin next month. But the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> communique, broadcast over the clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio, said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> this month has been `` moving troops back and forth from one battlefield to another aimlessly like a frightened monkey'' to withstand guerrilla strikes. It called the claim `` stinking and deceitful.'' `` There is no sign that the Vietnamese enemy is preparing to withdraw 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' the communique said. `` This is more shameless propaganda to deceive world public opinion.'' The communique cited details of what it claimed to be Vietnamese troop movements in recent months. Western analysts regard <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> claims with suspicion and most are not verified by independent sources. On Saturday, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also said the Vietnamese claims of troop withdrawal were deceptive. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is the most powerful of three rebel groups in a coalition led by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. Announcements of the Vietnamese withdrawal have sparked some fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> could return to power. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion. Millions of Cambodians were killed or died of starvation or disease in the regime's attempt to impose radical agrarian communism.

<HEAD>Six Dead in Assassination Attempt; Three Indian Soldiers Slain In
Ambush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sinhalese extremists opened fire with automatic rifles at the home of a politician and killed six people, including the politician's 10-year-old daughter, police said Sunday. In northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, Tamil rebels ambushed a convoy of Indian troops and killed at least three soldiers, residents said. The politician, K.W.R. <PERSON> Dharmasena </PERSON>, his wife and three supporters were injured in the assassination attempt late Saturday night, said a police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance with police regulations. He said the dead included <PERSON> Dharmasena </PERSON>'s daughter and his father. The other victims, all men, were relatives of <LOCATION> Dharmasena </LOCATION>, he said. The attack occurred in the town of <LOCATION> Homagama </LOCATION>, 12 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Earlier Saturday, an opposition party candidate and two of his supporters were shot to death by suspected Sinhalese nationalists in the town of <LOCATION> Natala </LOCATION>, 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. They were the latest in a series of attacks blamed on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an underground group of nationalist Sinhalese opposed to an accord signed last July to end violence by Tamil separatists. The Tamil ambush in the northern district of <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION> killed three soldiers and wounded at least five other Indian troops, said residents who spoke on condition of anonymity. They did not know of any rebel casualties. There was no comment from the Indian government. At least 50,000 Indian soldiers have been deployed in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to disarm Tamil rebels who renounced the peace accord. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which as a large Tamil population of its own, sponsored the accord. The plan calls for Tamils to lay down their arms in exchange for the creation of district councils. Sinhalese extremists contend the pact makes too many concessions to the Tamils, who are fighting for a separate homeland. <PERSON> Dharmasena </PERSON> is a candidate from the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for elections scheduled next Thursday. At least 19 candidates have been killed by the Sinhalese front in the past two months, and there have been 12 assassination attempts on candidates.

 At least five people have died and thousands have been forced to flee their homes because of flooding in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s northeastern districts, government officials and news reports said Sunday. Last summer, more than one-quarter of the nation's 105 million people were forced to flee the worst flooding in 70 years.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least 30,000 people have been marooned. Thousands of others made their way to relief camps and were being aided by local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officers and government agencies. The government-owned Bengalai-language <ORGANIZATION> Dainik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bangla </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said at least 500,000 people had been driven from their homes during the past week of rain and flooding.

It consists of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and a 158-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and replaces the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s law-making body. The guerrilla groups called the elections a farce. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> holds only 46 seats _ or 25 percent _ of the 184 occupied seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. But virtually all the rest are held by groups or individuals with ties to the government, according to foreign observers. Two former guerrillas hold what the government calls `` opposition'' seats. There are 50 vacant seats that <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> says have been left open for the guerrillas if they stop fighting. The vacancies are for electoral districts which are either controlled by the guerrillas or are the scenes of heavy fighting. `` We are ready to listen to the views of the opposition,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said, speaking in the Pushtu language. `` We are ready to receive them in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.'' A translation was provided in English for foreign diplomats and journalists. The Parliament was convened in the ornately columned, gilt-ceilinged star palace in the foreign ministry compound. The legislators, some in turbans and robes, others in Western attire, were brought to the compound in buses guarded by soldiers. Inside the palace, no shooting was heard during the opening session, but each day, artillery booms around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, which sprawls on a plain around the bases of several hills. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said the signing of an accord last month providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` opened new doors for peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' but he said it `` does not mean overnight peace.'' The U.S.-backed guerrillas have not halted their battle despite the start of the Soviet withdrawal May 15, and they say they'll keep fighting as long as <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, a former secret police commander, remains in power Rocket attacks by the guerrillas have grown more frequent since Soviet troops started withdrawing. The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> Times reported that five people were killed in rocket attacks Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> opened with a black-bearded clergyman intoning verses from the Koran, and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> prefaced his speech with `` in the name of Allah, the merciful and almighty.'' The Afghan president spoke of his desire for a `` neutral and non-aligned nation,'' but he also spoke of continued friendship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said his government wanted a `` mixed economy and foreign investment so that all Afghans in their shops can carry out their work and be sure of their future.'' The last Parliament met in 1973, the year King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> was ousted in a coup by his cousin, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> was assassinated five years later in a coup that installed a Soviet-style government.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> legislator <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, the former radical protest leader, said at a booksellers' convention he has revised his thinking about the death penalty. While being questioned about his recently published book, `` Reunion: A Memoir,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> was asked Saturday if he's withdrawn his opposition to the death penalty. `` I've come to a kind of tortured conclusion that I'm not going to lead a fight to repeal the death penalty,'' said <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, a Democratic Assemblyman who represents <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION>. `` We live in a society in <LOCATION> Calfornia </LOCATION> that is very open and very violent,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said. `` People who commit murders are generally in prison about eight years and then they are back on the streets. Until that is corrected, I'm not going to oppose the death penalty.'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, who is married to actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, was at the 88th annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Booksellers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to promote his book, published by <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. In `` Reunion,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> looks back at the political turbulence of the 1960s as the beginning of his disillusionment with government, then follows through to a renewal of his faith in government growing out of the Watergate scandal. `` It's a story that began as a history and it became more personal as time went on because I was searching for truth about the'60s and about my youth,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said he believed in the 1960s that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was drifting toward a police state. But after Watergate, `` I had to try to understand that many of the people who had tried to put me in jail had failed and were going to jail themselves.''

<HEAD>Democrats Try to Dispel Image of Chaos in Convention Preparations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrats were elated with the photo, buried in the B-section of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, of a crane installing media booths in the hall that will host the party's convention this summer. `` It's the appearance of motion ... Things looked like they were screwed up and now it looks like things are happening,'' party spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said, only half in jest as he referred to the convention's public relations debacle of a week earlier. <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> quickly added that the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention plans are in fact on track, following a press walkthrough two weeks ago that left media representatives with a sinking feeling that things were nightmarishly behind schedule. The party is scurrying to undo the perception that their July 18-21 presidential nominating convention will be a logistics disaster, and moving to keep that perception from becoming reality. By way of damage control, convention Chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> rushed out a letter to all media organizations promising the staff is `` vigorously pursuing appropriate action'' to respond to questions that went unanswered at the walkthrough. He promised a press packet June 1 to include such information as a critical vendor list, for necessities like furniture and utilities. Such a list went out about a month earlier at the party's 1984 convention. Written materials and informed staff members were on hand to reassure the press at a second walkthrough a few days later that their concerns are being handled on such matters as housing, vendors and `` turnaround credentials'' that allow reporters to give their pass to a colleague when leaving the floor. Emphasis is being placed on the fact there will be an increase of 10 to 15 percent above 1984 numbers of media credentials issued. Convention veteran <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Podrazik </PERSON>, who has handled media logistics in past years was brought on board the day of the first walkthrough, and this weekend will be joined by <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> to help with media arrangements. The person responsible for the media-tour foul-up was ousted, and <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> press office, has assumed overall responsibility as communications director for both the party and the convention. `` We're in a lot better shape than many people suspect,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> insisted. He and others involved with the convention say the basics _ housing, transportation and credentials _ are more or less arranged. But the staff members knowledgeable on those matters were not at the first media tour on May 16. `` It is fair to say we did not put our best foot forward in that walkthrough,'' said convention press secretary <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. The presidential campaigns of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, however, say they are having no problems as they embark on their own convention preparations. `` All the things we feel we need to do are getting done,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> logistics manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said he has had nothing but cooperation, and `` It's basically a wide open door of information'' from the convention officials. But <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, a veteran convention staffer who managed the hall for the 1984 convention in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, also said he sees the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> operation as comparatively behind schedule even in light of his observation that `` Democratic conventions are inherently complicated disorganized functions.'' `` I wish they would have picked up a greater number of experienced people earlier,'' said <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>. `` The convention will happen. It's just a question of how much pain and grief will be suffered and by whom.'' He noted the drumbeat of concerns being voiced about the size of the Omni basketball arena, which will seat 11,000, compared to the 15,000 seating capacity in 1984 at the Moscone Center Hall. The Democrats have solved the problem _ providing comparatively more total seating _ by using the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, across the street from the Omni, for media workspace, spillover viewing areas via large screens, and office and reception rooms. But that does not mean that spectators and party bigwigs are going to be happy being relegated to watching the convention from across the street. The Democrats are doing a hard sell to make the <ORGANIZATION> WCC </ORGANIZATION> seem an attractive alternative. There, said <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, people can sprawl out in comfort instead of being squished in the crowded Omni, and `` be handed a refreshment by a young Democrat.'' `` We are going to be agressively promoting the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> as a place to hold meetings and briefings and press conferences,'' he said. As for the Omni, everyone sighed with relief last week when the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> were edged out of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> playoffs. That assured they would not tie up the Omni convention hall until late June. `` Thank God the <ORGANIZATION> Celtics </ORGANIZATION> beat the <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, in charge of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign convention arrangements. The Omni is now available, but an access problem remains for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> which is booked with a trade convention until the first of July. Because of that, the media trailers, cables and arrangements that normally would be done over six or seven weeks will have to be completed in just over two weeks, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gralnick </PERSON>, vice president and executive producer of special programming for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gralnick </PERSON> was philosophical about the foul-up, noting the Republican convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> has had no such problems, but that, `` It's axiomatic that Republicans are more organized than Democrats.''

 Former City Councilman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> handily defeated incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooksey </PERSON> in his bid for a second three-year term, besting the mayor by more than 15 percent of the vote in a weekend runoff. Turnout for Saturday's election was put at about 20 percent by City Clerk <PERSON> Elden </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON>, who said: `` It's a lower turnout than anything we have had in a number of years. I would say it's lower because of Memorial Day weekend and people scattered here and there.'' With all the vote in, <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> had 36,985 votes, or 58.4 percent, to 26,308, or 41.6 percent, for <PERSON> Cooksey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, 43, a former president of this capital city's <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, captured 40 percent of the vote in the May 7 non-partisan primary to advance to the runoff against <PERSON> Cooksey </PERSON>, 54, who ran second in the field of eight with 32 percent. At issue in the campaign were the city's sagging economy and rising taxes and utility rates. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> was caught in an economic downturn several months into <PERSON> Cooksey </PERSON>'s first term and `` fairly or unfairly the business community regarded him as their mortal enemy,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Rindy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cooksey </PERSON>'s media adviser. `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> had the misfortune to get elected mayor of <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> just when the power got cut off,'' <PERSON> Rindy </PERSON> said. During the campaign, <PERSON> Cooksey </PERSON> tried to emphasize his accomplishments, many of them in the environmental area, such as the passage of bonds to clean up sewage discharge and the implementation of a watershed ordinance. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, meanwhile, blamed the downturn in the economy on <PERSON> Cooksey </PERSON> and said the City Council, with <PERSON> Cooksey </PERSON> in the lead, was not doing enough to keep the budget in line and attract businesses to <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arrival in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was big news around the world, but thousands of this city's residents seemed oblivious to the historic occasion as they basked in the glorious spring weather. As <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plane touched down in the early afternoon Sunday, the Arbat, a cobbled pedestrian walkway about a mile long, was crowded with people strolling, watching the street artists and standing in line to buy ice cream, shish-kabobs, sundaes, soft drinks and juice. Even the military officials seemed relaxed as they sauntered along the walkway, carrying walkie-talkies as they mingled with pedestrians. Some sat on wooden park benches in the middle of the walkway, which had been decorated with freshly planted flowers. Crowds on the walkway, lined by 16th century houses, were larger than those gathered at the foot of the nearby street leading to <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the home of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, are staying. Although Soviet television broadcast the arrival and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> live, the televisions in the window of an electronics store showed cartoons Another TV set in a crowded snack bar featured a video of <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> gyrating on stage to the tune `` Get Back.'' The Arbat is <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s version of <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION> with scores of street artists drawing portraits in charcoal and oil, where bystanders often crowd around to watch the progression of the work; artists line the street with their work, glow-in-the-dark oil painters, a few restrained nudes and landscapes. Other forms of entertainment on the Arbat are a lone scale, with people lined up to find out their weight and a children's show with large stuffed farm animals _ and a live chicken. The brown bear held a paper summit friendship flag with the stars-and-stripes and the hammer and sickle. Some residents took advantage of Sunday to shop. As usual, there were lines to purchase anything from an ice cream cone to a portion of red sauercraut to a clump of radishes. In some stores, there are two lines: one to pay for an item, the other to pick it up. One popular speciality store served two types of pate, sausage, potato salad and sandwiches. And Soviets apparently are n't adverse to physical shoving when they want to get out of a store or a jam-packed subway car.

 The White House advance team handling <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s schedule visited the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> pet market, but decided it was n't the kind of thing the first lady needed to see on her maiden trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The outdoor market is a fascinating slice of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> life: a huge area where people sell dogs, cats, birds, fish, mice, lizards, hamsters, snails and every kind of animal equipment from dog brushes to aquarium cleaners. Held every Saturday and Sunday, the market is definitely not the cleanest place in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, nor the quietest. Debris from stalls that have been torn down litter the area, and the dirt floor was covered with sawdust. All the while, the animals carry on the racket of barking, meowing and tweeting. The Russians carry their pets to the market all kinds of ways. Newborn kittens peer out of gym bags or sleep in cardboard boxes, and puppies play in playpens generally the habitat is children. Birds seem particularly popular. `` People buy them because they are beautiful,'' said the man hawking his white pigeons. One sellers stuffed at least 20 green, yellow and blue parakeets into a cage. The animals, while plentiful, are not cheap. A Siamese kitten cost about $ 64; a pug went for $ 640.

 Summit-time means souvenir time, and Soviets are no different from Americans when it comes to hawking items to commemorate the occasion. The Soviets are fans of znockki, lapel pins used to decorate outfits. Summit pins are a hit, and one of the most popular varieties _ costing less than a dollar _ shows an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag and a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> flag forming a `` V.'' `` Mockba-Moscow 1988'' is the inscription. At the Hotel Mezhdunarodnaya, site of the international press center, American-made summit tee-shirts sold like hot-cakes at $ 20 each. The salesgirl said she had sold about 500 in two days. The price did n't deter an Italian reporter who bought eight, charging them to his <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> card. `` What are you going to do?'' he said, explaining his family wanted the souvenirs. `` They wo n't go on sale,'' said one man from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, who did n't want to be quoted by name. `` There are no specials in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>.'' Black sweatshirts with `` perestroikia'' on them, and white ones with a summit designation, were on sale at the Hotel Rossiya, home to many television journalists. They sold for 35 rubles, about $ 56. A European journalist said he ignored the price; he planned to get a higher rate for his rubles by trading hard currency on the black market.

 The summit press center is located in a modern hotel complex built in 1980 as an international trade complex. The facility is much like the one the Americans set up at a hotel in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the U.S.-Soviet summit last December. It has banks of telephones and telex printers. Americans and Soviets officials hold press conferences on everything from arms control to the printing of a new book in a cavernous room where reporters sit at long tables, many typing at computers. Reporters use their press passes as collateral to get earphones that provide simultaneous translation in English, Russian, Spanish, French, and German. Soviets waiters sell cheese, salami and ham sandwiches, for a fee, as well as instant coffee _ no milk or cream. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> is dispensed for free, but at one point it ran out. Tables with a range of pamphlets and books on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are available for free.

 Is it live? Or is it <PERSON> Bosendorfer </PERSON>? A rocket scientist and a robotics expert using a 9-foot piano have teamed up to create an instrument that can record every flicker of a virtuoso's finger _ and then improve on it. The Bosendorfer 290 SE Imperial Grand looks like a piano next to a computer. But behind the keyboard, optical sensors, tiny electric motors and three linked computers form the guts of a frighteningly accurate musical instrument. Invented by a <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahnke </PERSON>, a scientist from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bosendorfer </PERSON> is played like any piano. Inside, the instruments are recording even microscopic motions. Once the pianist walks away, a punch of a few computer buttons brings forth the performance just played, depressing the piano keys and pedals exactly as the musician did. But the Bosendorfer can also improve on the performance. `` In its most straightforward mode, the piano ` listens' to a live piano performance, ` remembers' that performance note for note and then reproduces that performance _ on the very instrument upon which that performance was played,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Amuedo </PERSON>, a recording engineer who worked on artificial intelligence projects at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. The potential for the $ 100,000 instrument _ a sort of player piano for the computer age _ was immediately apparent to pianist <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyer </PERSON> and composer-producer <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuller </PERSON>, who are collaborating on the first recording using the Bosendorfer. Because the piano records its own performance not with microphones but with tiny optical and electronic sensors, the sometimes-disturbing background noise that can crop up at a live performance has no impact on a recording made on the Bosendorfer. A subway car could clatter through the concert hall and it would n't matter Once a performance is over, the hall could be cleared and the performance could be played amid silence. Or the piano could be shipped to a recording studio where the keys could be punched to bring forth the performance with all its spontaneity and energy but none of the background noise. With the push of a few computer keys, the handlers of the Bosendorfer can correct the tiniest of errors _ mistakes inaudible to the human ear but visible among the numbers and symbols on the computer terminal. `` It raises a kind of moral aesthetic question as to how perfect you want to make your recording,'' said <PERSON> Schuller </PERSON>. `` You can make it so perfect that it becomes almost inhuman.'' In March, <PERSON> Moyer </PERSON> performed <LOCATION> Mussorgsky </LOCATION>'s `` Pictures at an Exhibition'' and several short pieces by <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Wellesley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Afterward, <PERSON> Schuller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amuedo </PERSON> went to work on the editing and found on the computer screen the inevitable tiny errors that even the best of pianists make. <PERSON> Moyer </PERSON>'s performance, the first cassette disc using the Bosendorfer, is to be released this fall on <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Recordings. Amuedo defends the editing capabilities of the instrument as merely improving techniques already widely used by recording engineers. Record producers edit recordings heavily, even live recordings, he argues. The Bosendorfer merely makes the process easier and cleaner. Nor, he said, is the idea of a note-perfect recording anything new, as anyone who has heard a player piano knows. Using existing techniques, a pianist could play a passage beautifully but make one mistake. Correcting the error would require tossing out the well-played section and replaying it. With the Bosendorfer, engineers merely have to plug in the correct note. <PERSON> Schuller </PERSON> also sees the <PERSON> Bosendorfer </PERSON> as an unparalleled teaching tool. Pianists can listen to their own playing exactly as it sounds on the piano. And the computer can slow down a performance without affecting the pitch of a note, allowing pianists to judge their own execution of rapid passages. Amuedo is unconcerned the Bosendorfer will kill the market for live performances, with all their errors. A tiny mistake passes unnoticed in a live performance, he said. On a record that is heard several times, it can become an annoyance. `` No amount of editing is going to salvage a musically bad performance,'' <PERSON> Amuedo </PERSON> said. `` When <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> gets up and plays, he makes lots and lots of mistakes and yet still people pay $ 20 and $ 30 to hear him play because he makes music out of those mistakes.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Adviser Says Americans Reject Soviet Arms Proposals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A senior adviser to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> charged at the start of summit talks Sunday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had rejected a pair of Soviet proposals aimed at clearing the way for drastic reductions in long-range nuclear missiles. The accusation came as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> welcomed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit with an appeal to end nuclear testing and preserve the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which would limit the president's <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> plan for a space-based missile defense system. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators are making progress toward a treaty reducing strategic weapons by as much as 50 percent. Citing other joint efforts to ease East-West tensions, the president said that `` our work has begun to produce results.'' <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> negotiators had rejected Kremlin proposals to ease the two countries' impasse over Star Wars and verify limits on submarine-launched cruise missiles. The two issues are among the main obstacles to the proposed START or Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty being negotiated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet experts in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> dismissed any attempt to link Star Wars to progress on a START agreement. National Security Adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> held out little hope of completing a treaty before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next January. <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, who has advised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the Star Wars issue, said the Americans had rejected a Soviet proposal to discuss what types of testing could be permitted under the 1972 ABM accord. That treaty limits each side to a missile defense at one site. The joint statement issued after the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December said both sides would be allowed to test `` as required.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said that allows tests of potential Star Wars weapons but the Soviets disagree. <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON> said that `` within the framework of the December statement, we need to settle some technical questions.'' But he charged that `` the Americans want to destroy the treaty.'' If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deploys `` a nationwide defense, it will violate the -LRB- ABM -RRB- treaty, and jeopardizes effort to cut strategic offensive weapons,'' <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON> said. The two sides also agreed in December to negotiate ceilings on submarine-launched nuclear missiles, but not to include them in the 6,000-warhead limit proposed for the strategic weapons treaty. The Soviets, said <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, have proposed monitoring the presence of nuclear warheads on submarine-launched cruise missiles using devices to detect neutron and gamma-ray emissions. American officials have rejected that idea. They say it would be too easy to bypass such devices and that they oppose allowing Soviet inspectors to board <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> submarines for on-site verification of any limits on the missiles. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that `` it is incumbent on us to discuss constructively the main aspects of disarmament: the set of issues related to 50 percent cuts in strategic offensive arms, while preserving the 1972 ABM treaty, problems of eliminating chemical weapons, reductions in armed forces and conventional armaments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, cessation of nuclear testing.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have repeatedly rejected <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ` s appeals for an end to nuclear testing, and refused to join an 18-month Soviet testing moratorium. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' show that there could be a fifth summit meeting before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next January, but `` only if the two sides reach agreement in START talks.'' Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, chief of the Soviet general staff, said the two countries might be able to strike a START deal by the end of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second term. `` My own personal opinion is that we've covered more than half the ground,'' <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> interview here. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` would certainly like to see the START treaty completed during his term. The broad outlines are there. ... We're now down in the trenches working out the very difficult issues having to do with verification'' and cruise and mobile missiles. `` I would like to see some progress this week and progress is possible, but there is a lot of hard work ahead,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arabatov </PERSON>, a Soviet government adviser on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> affairs, said on `` Meet the Press'' that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` will welcome any step towards agreement and if there is an opportunity to have an agreement before the term of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expires, he would be very glad.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said agreement on a joint verification experiment for a nuclear test ban, which seemed doubtful Saturday, `` may be back in the cards'' for signing at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, said `` progress is being made'' also on a peaceful nuclear explosives treaty, although <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said it would n't be ready for signing at the summit.

 Democratic candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast Sunday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s economic problems led <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to another summit with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner for his party's presidential nomination, said that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is probably the first Soviet leader `` to recognize that Communism is a failure, at least the way it's been practiced in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Unless the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> begins to devote significantly more resources to its domestic economy ... and less to the military, than they're going to become a third-rate economic power,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, who was interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> last week while he campaigned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said `` most thoughtful observers agree that it is the very serious condition of the Soviet domestic situation that has been largely responsible'' for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s involvement in the summit. `` I think that is the driving force behind this, the recognition on his part that they're falling further and further behind, they're losing the economic race, the technological race and that they can not be a great nation unless they significantly reduce the amount of resources they're putting into the military,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holds a commanding lead over Democratic rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination. And in recent opinion polls, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads likely Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. If he wins in November, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said there would be `` some very, very significant differences'' in his foreign policy from that of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` For one thing, I think we've got the best opportunity for meaningful arms control and arms reduction we've had in our lifetimes,'' he said.

 A painting depicting a grinning President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in blue jeans and cowboy hat astride a white horse is among the troublesome summit issues that advisers to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be trying to untangle. Soviet authorities confiscated the painting by <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> artist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON>, which had hung briefly in a private Cajun food restaurant in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that is serving gumbo and fried catfish to visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials and journalists covering the summit. The Soviets also took away a painting showing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in a yellow suit holding a red Soviet flag, with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and a peasant family in the background. Officials said they will not return the art until they make sure <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is not insulted by his portrayal as a cowboy. `` The Soviets do n't understand <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art. They just do n't know how to read this,'' said <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON>, a drawling, boot-clad cowboy born in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> `` They do n't appreciate that this is an individual's artistic interpretation, something not permitted here.'' <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON> said that although the Soviets removed both paintings, it was the one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ not of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ that concerned them. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> painting, copied for <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> posters, was presented to the president in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in 1986 and will be on exhibition until it is given to him permanently when he leaves office next January, the artist said. The painting was displayed briefly in a restaurant that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Folse </PERSON>, a Cajun chef and owner of <PERSON> Lafitte </PERSON>'s Landing Restaurant in <LOCATION> Donaldsonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, was allowed to open here for the duration of the summit. <PERSON> Folse </PERSON> said the flap over the paintings was not the only bureaucratic complication he has encountered. He said the 14 tons of food he shipped here from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> caused confusion among Soviet customs officials, who apparently had never seen crayfish or oysters. `` We expect we are going to diplomatically work out this issue of the paintings before the summit ends,'' <PERSON> Folse </PERSON> said. `` The Soviets are making lots of changes with perestroika, but we ca n't expect them to adapt to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art or American food overnight.

<TEXT>
 A third battle of <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> is brewing, this one over a shopping center complex being built near where the Union and Rebel forces clashed in 1861 and again in 1862. Neither the outrage of preservationists, the pleas of Civil War buffs nor 166 signatures on congressional legislation has been able to stop bulldozers from plowing ground on the project. Construction crews already have begun to lay access roads and prepare the property for sewers. They expect to start construction on the first section of 560 townhouses and detached homes in 60 days. The developers say the section is not part of the land considered sacred by historians. But local preservationists argue that even if the hill from which Confederate Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> directed troops has not yet been touched, the excavation work should stop until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has had time to act. The National <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Battlefield </LOCATION>, about 30 miles from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is cherished for its bucolic surroundings where visitors can easily imagine what Civil War troops saw in 1861 and 1862 during two of the South's important victories _ the battles of <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, or as Northerners say, the battles of Bull Run. But the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> metropolitan area is one of the nation's fastest growing regions, and any land around the 4,500-acre historic park not owned by the government is vulnerable to surburban sprawl As for the 600 acres adjacent to the park where <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s troops gathered and battlefield hospitals were located, <ORGANIZATION> Hazel-Peterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plans to go ahead with construction unless stopped by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, spokesman for the firm, the most prominent development company in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. A few weeks ago, Reps. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mzarek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, started action to stop construction by introducing a bill that would have the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary take possession of the land for park expansion. It quickly got the approval of at least 166 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> who signed on as co-sponsors, but did not win over the three congressmen whose districts comprise northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. All are Republicans and all are well-acquainted with the wealthy <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> family and its involvement in local <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> politics. In fact, not one of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s 10 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had signed on in support of the Mzarek-Andrews bill or entered into the debate in any way. Last week, that changed and suddenly there was new hope for historians that the bulldozers would be idled. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., whose district is near the battlefield, introduced a bill that would enable the government to acquire the land through `` legislative taking,'' a process that is faster than that proposed by <PERSON> Mzarek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s bill also provides for highway construction to relieve traffic congestion threatening the park. Mzarek and <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> quickly gave their support for the plan, and immediately signing on as a co-sponsor was Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., a longtime friend and partner in some business ventures with <PERSON> John </PERSON> `` Til'' <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION> Hazel-Peterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> Supporting development are county officials who anticipate increased tax revenues. `` We are pleased and happy the project is being built,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Noe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> executive before <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> introduced his bill. `` The greatest hope for stability in the tax base is economic development and a regional mall is the catalyst for the kind of economic development communities need.'' Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> also has opposed congressional intervention, saying the land would cost the government too much. <PERSON> Hazel-Peterson </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said his firm bought the land for between $ 10 million and $ 12 million. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said it probably would cost the government $ 70 million to acquire it. `` Not only is the cost high, but it will not solve the problem, since the proposed mall could simply move further down the road, either imposing a traffic burden on the park or requiring that land also to be purchased,'' said <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> in a letter to Rep. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Development is going to occur all around the battlefield whether it is us or someone else,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. `` This land is not for sale. We do n't want it taken and we are proceeding with construction.''

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> named 25 new cardinals from 18 countries Sunday, including prelates from <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in a move to bolster the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Two Americans, Archbishops <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, were on the list. The new `` princes of the church,'' who will be formally elevated at a June 28 Vatican session, bring the number of cardinals to 161. Four new cardinals come from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, two each from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and one each from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>, 67, in a statement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he was `` truly honored, very humbled and deeply grateful'' to be chosen. He said he would work with `` all those of good will ... to build a more just and caring community.'' <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON>, 60, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that he's `` deeply moved and honored'' and will `` carry on the same functions whether I'm cardinal or not.'' In announcing the appointments at the end of a Mass in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basilica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> noted that the new cardinals come from every continent, reflecting the `` universality'' of the church's 860 million followers Most of the new appointees were heads of large dioceses or <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> departments traditionally held by cardinals. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials described as especially significant the naming of cardinals for <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> stronghold in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a British colony that reverts to Communist Chinese rule in 1997. `` These were courageous appointments,'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> told reporters. `` These are not symbolic choices but options for the future.'' As <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s first publicly named cardinal, the pope chose <PERSON> Vincentas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sladkevicius </PERSON>, 68, the apostolic administrator of <PERSON> Kaisiadorys </PERSON> who was appointed president of the Lithuanian epispocal conference in April. From 1963 to 1982, he was `` impeded'' by Soviet authorities from performing his religious duties and was virtually confined to his residence, according to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sladkevicius </PERSON> becomes the second resident cardinal in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Julijans Vaivods of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> was elevated by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> in 1983. At least 2 million of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million people are estimated to be Roman Catholics. The pope, who has frequently expressed his desire to visit his flock in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, has publicly disclosed that at least on two occasions he has been refused permission to travel to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. The pope moved to bolster the church in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by elevating <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baptist </PERSON> <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng-Chung </PERSON>, the 63-year-old bishop of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. There has been no resident cardinal in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the Communists took over in 1949. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> cut ties with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in 1957 and established a breakway Catholic church, which claims 3 million members. An unknown number of other Catholics remain secretly loyal to the pope, and several are imprisoned for their religious practices. The two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appointments bring to nine the number of American cardinals. Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, 52, was considered for promotion but passed over in what <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> acknowledged was a `` great exclusion'' for the American church. The spokesman said <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> was not included because of his young age and was likely to become a cardinal at a later time. Named as the first cardinal in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, a Marxist country that the pope will visit during his September tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, was <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Urs </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Balthasar </PERSON>, a Swiss theologian highly regarded by the pope, was the only non-bishop among the 25 new cardinals. In addition to voting in a papal conclave, cardinals advise the pope, serve on special <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> commissions and act as spokesmen for the church in their countries. The number of cardinals under the age of 80 and therefore eligible to vote for a new pope will now number 121 _ one more than the limit set by church rules. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> offered no immediate explanation. However, two of the cardinals will turn 80 this summer.

 About two dozen Soviet Jews waving posters and yellow Stars of <PERSON> David </PERSON> outside the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> walls urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Sunday to make a summit appeal to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for relaxation of curbs on Jewish emigration. Elsewhere in the Soviet capital, Armenians beseeched <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to bring up their demands for control over land in a neighboring republic. ans also called on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to bring up their demand for control over land in a neighboring republic. `` We Demand Freedom of Emigration,'' read a poster held by <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostroverkh </PERSON>, 7, who wore a <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mouse </ORGANIZATION> T-shirt and was the youngest of the Jewish protesters who gathered at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> one block from the Kremlin. <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON>, said his family has been trying to emigrate since 1979. The government says <PERSON> Ostroverkh </PERSON> had access to state secrets while working as a social psychologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. A few policemen kept their distance and made no attempt to disperse the demonstrators. But workers, who normally take Sunday off, noisily sandblasted the library steps and sprayed the protesters and reporters with clouds of dust. `` A lot of refuseniks live a horrible life. Their secrets are older than they are,'' said <PERSON> Ostroverkh </PERSON>, 42, holding up his left hand on which he had written a prayer in Hebrew. He said he wanted to emigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> so `` my son can be religious, not study things like ` grandfather <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> was good because he made the Jews work on Sabbath.''' <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Diky </PERSON>, 38, who also has been refused permission to emigrate since 1979, held a poster which read: `` We Welcome the Summit and Hope for a Dramatic Turn in the Fate of Refuseniks.'' `` You can only talk to my government from a firm position,'' he said. `` This government is used to living not in a humane or moral way, but in their own way,'' said <PERSON> Diky </PERSON>, whose brother and sister emigrated to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in December. `` I hope Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be strong enough not to surrender to those who are against us,'' <PERSON> Ostroverkh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans to meet Monday with a group of refuseniks and Soviet human rights activists at <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the official residence of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador where the Reagans are staying during the five-day summit. Soviet authorities reportedly have made it difficult for some of the group to see <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, a Russian Orthodox activist in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, police removed two <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> activists, <PERSON> Nijole </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadunaite </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antanas </PERSON> <PERSON> Terleckas </PERSON>, from a Moscow-bound train Friday night in their republic's capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>. The following night, however, the two were told there had been a mistake and they were allowed to travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday for the meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Alec </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelichonok </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> Jew refused permission to emigrate for more than 10 years, said a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officer warned him Thursday night he would face `` administrative measures'' if he went to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> meeting. On Saturday, <PERSON> Ogordnikov </PERSON> said, police pulled five Ukrainian Catholics off a train destined for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and put on another train headed back to <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION>. The five had hoped to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> even though they had not been invited to <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, hundreds of Armenians gathered Sunday at <LOCATION> Vagankovskoye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and later at downtown Pushkin Square `` to call on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to take up our issue in his negotiations,'' one of them said. Armenian painter <PERSON> Koryun </PERSON> <PERSON> Nahabidyan </PERSON> said that in their speeches and posters, the demonstrators welcomed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and demanded that the government turn the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region over to the Armenian republic. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which is part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, has been the subject of street rallies in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> since February.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, out for a pleasant Sunday stroll, won cheers and applause in the city's showcase Arbat mall during a chaotic 10-minute episode in which grim-faced <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents roughed up members of the crowd and the press The agents knocked over a fruit stand as they steamrolled through the crowd. The Reagans seemed stunned by the tumultuous scene and at times appeared to be jostled themselves. The president and first lady were completely encircled by <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officers who locked arms in a tight circle, using elbows and shoulders to spew people out of their way. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stopped the procession at one point to rescue <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> who was complaining loudly about the rough treatment. `` She sort of put out her hand and pulled me in'' to the presidential party, Miss <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. Tumult or not, the shirt-sleeved crowd of Sunday shoppers loudly cheered and applauded the president and first lady. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shook hands with onlookers who managed to get close enough. At one point, the president and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> climbed atop an open carriage and waved to the crowd, drawing widespread cheers. The unscheduled excursion occurred an hour after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> completed his first round of summit talks at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It had been widely rumored that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would have a surprise event Sunday evening, but his destination was not announced until after his motorcade left the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy residence, where he is staying, en route to the shopping area known as the Arbat several hundred yards away. `` It was a very heartwarming welcome, indeed. They all seemed very friendly,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He said he was not surprised. `` I have always heard that the Russian people are very friendly and outgoing.'' The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, which has primary responsibility for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s security here, was not informed of the walk until minutes before the president and first lady set out from the embassy residence, officials said. In some ways, the event was similar to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ` s unscheduled stop in a crowd in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> during the summit last December. To the delight of onlookers, the Soviet leader left his limousine and shook hands in the crowd. While there was an air of excitement, there was none of the turmoil that marked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s event When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife stepped from their armored car, people nearby broke into smiles and began cheering. Word of their arrival spread quickly, and people began surging toward the party to get a look. `` Somebody must have spread the word in advance,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said later. The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents seemed to panic at the crowd's reaction and began thrusting people out of the way. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents appeared startled and pushed people with more force than they usually exert, though significantly less than the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maer </PERSON> said he was punched in the stomach by a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officer, picked up and thrown over a barricade about the height of a bicycle rack. A television sound technician said his jacket pocket was ripped off by the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, and a photographer said he was punched in the back. Another photographer said his camera was broken, while a colleague complained he was bear-hugged and choked by his camera straps. `` General, tell your men to stop,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> assistant press secretary <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> shouted repeatedly at the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officer in charge of the security detail. American reporters tried to warn Soviets with children to stay back from the chaos. A fruit stand was overturned as agents pushed past, running and jumping over obstacles to catch up with the president. Standing on the sidewalk outside the nearby <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy, the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officials were first briefed on the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' plans and immediately held hurried consultations and sent agents down the street to the Arbat. During the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' walk, members of the presidential party, including spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and deputy chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, were shut out from the circle around <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The scene calmed when the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> departed the market, electing to walk down the street back to the embassy instead of riding in their limousine. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, chatting briefly with reporters, said he was pleased by the friendly reception he received from Soviet citizens as his motorcade drove into <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on his arrival from <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. Thousands of people lined the route, and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> flags were suspended over the city on ropes attached to blimps.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> considered a private visit with a prominent refusenik family Sunday, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources who said the idea was scrubbed when word came that it could hurt the family's chance to emigrate. A honey cake was baked and waiting at the apartment of <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>. The Ziemans talked excitedly of how water trucks washed their street clean and workers had daubed fresh paint on their apartment building _ signs that the Soviets were aware of plans for a Reagan visit. But the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> never came. After 11 years of waiting, it was another disappointment. `` When we started to apply to emigrate, I thought it would not be easy for us,'' sighed <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> as she gazed at the crowd on the street. `` The one thing I did n't want to attract is publicity, the mob, like this.'' A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who asked not to be identified said White House planners scrubbed consideration of a Zieman visit after the Soviets passed word that the Ziemans would never leave the country if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went to their home. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied Sunday there ever were definite plans for the <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> visit, saying only that a number of sites were scouted for potential <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> trips. The Ziemans will be among the refuseniks, the term given to those refused permission to emigrate, meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's home where the president is staying. Human rights is one of the most contentious issues on the agenda for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s five-day <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit with <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has vehemently rebutted Western criticism of Soviet human rights policies. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> abruptly canceled one of Monday's two planned meetings between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The discussions had been scheduled to take place between a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visit to a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> monastery and his meeting with dissidents and refuseniks. The Ziemans are <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Jews who in 1977 first sought permission to emigrate. Several other long-term refuseniks have been granted such permission in recent months, but an estimated 2,000 Soviet Jews have had applications pending. The Ziemans have been notified that they can not leave because <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON>, a computer specialist, would be a risk to Soviet security. They were alerted to a possible visit by the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> last week, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scouting officials came to their home. And they were not the only expectant parties: Soviet officials had cleaned up the neighborhood right up to patching the road and driveway right in front of the apartment. Local militia and plainclothes agents patrolled the area. The Reagans' failure to show clearly disappointed the Ziemans and about 300 curious residents who gathered outside their apartment building, alerted to something unusual by the heavy police presence. After the Ziemans applied to emigrate, <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> lost her job as an English professor and <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> lost his as an advanced computer specialist, working as a hospital plumber until ill health forced him to stop last fall. Their elder daughter, <PERSON> Galya </PERSON>, got out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last year, apparently because authorities did not realize from her married name of <PERSON> Khatutsky </PERSON> that she was a member of the <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> family. She now lives in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, campaigning for her family's emigration. With her perfect British-accented English, curly hair and cherubic cheeks, daughter <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, 12, charms the many foreigners who visit the Ziemans' three-room apartment. The presidential couple reportedly became interested in the Ziemans' case after <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> wrote to the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> in English on April 4 asking for their help to emigrate. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON>, who is suffering from hepatitis and an undiagnosed condition that gives him double vision, lay on the sofa and discussed his hopes for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visit. `` If not this visit, I do n't know what will help me,'' he said. `` I think many refuseniks are expecting good news now.'' Hopes traditionally run high amid dissidents and would-be emigres in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> when prominent Western politicians visit, since the Kremlin traditionally solves several or even a few dozen human rights cases during such meetings. On Sunday, very few of those who gathered on the street outside knew the Ziemans or that they are refuseniks. They just knew something unusual was happening. But one elderly lady was convinced <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would never show. `` There are n't enough security around,'' she said. `` If the president was coming, there would be <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> in every doorway.''

 <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, professor of Marxism-Leninism and wife of the local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, was visibly piqued. For days, gossip had been spreading that she had spent a small fortune on a fur coat. `` When will these rumors stop that my coat cost 12,000 rubles?'' the petite brunette from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> asked co-workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Stavropol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> one day. `` It was only 608 rubles.'' The long-ago incident, recalled by a former dean of the school where Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> taught, could have happened today. As the wife of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been criticized by some Soviets who maintain she embraces Western materialism. It was in the provincial <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> city 850 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> began their rise to the top of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> hierarchy. The <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON> lived here for 23 years, following their graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1954. Residents remember seeing the stocky balding <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ then the regional party boss _ jogging some mornings along the poplar-shaded streets or in the park opposite his one-story 19th century home at 109 Dzherzhinksy Street. The couple frequented the regional art museum when it held shows from the Hermitage, the <PERSON> Tretyakov </PERSON> or other celebrated Soviet galleries, according to <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendik </PERSON>, then museum director. Those who knew <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in those early years say his flesh-pressing, street-corner brand of politicking took shape in <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION>, as he made his way up through the party ranks in this city of 300,000 people set in the green, rolling hills north of the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. `` He was everywhere, visiting all the stores and enterprises to see what their problems were,'' said <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessyonova </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION>'s largest store, the Central Universal Store. `` He listened to people's problems, and gave them advice about how to change things.'' The man who would make `` glasnost,'' or openness, an official policy knew by name almost all of the journalists from <LOCATION> Stavropolskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pravda </LOCATION>, the local party newspaper, and would often brainstorm with them, recalled editor-in-chief <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuchmayev </PERSON>. `` He'd come and see us and say, ` Hello, fellows, what's up?''' <PERSON> Kuchmayev </PERSON> said. `` He talked out loud about his thoughts, what he had seen. He did n't order us to print things, but led by example.'' One day when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was addressing workers at the <LOCATION> Electoavtomatika </LOCATION> electronics plant, the microphone failed. `` Other officials would have crushed bones because of that,'' said plant director <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>. `` Not <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeyevich </PERSON>. He pushed aside the microphone and said, ` Fine, comrades, it will be more informal this way.''' For 18 years, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Siberian-born daughter of railroad workers, taught Marxist dialectics and historical materialism at the agricultural institute, working on the second floor of a 19th century building where girls of good family were once taught by Russian Orthodox priests. By all accounts, she was a bright, hard-working teacher who demanded much from her students, and also from herself. Every year, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> taught 180 students in the elements of Marxism-Leninism, delivering lectures in a room with hospital-green walls decorated with large portraits of <LOCATION> Descartes </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hegel </PERSON> and other philosophers. She was paid 320 rubles a month, about $ 500. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was once grabbed by a guard after she entered the institute. He had mistaken her for a student, and wanted her to leave her coat in the student's cloakroom, recalled the former dean, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuguyev </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Pankratovich </PERSON>, when are people going to recognize the fact that I work here and am not a student?'' <PERSON> Chuguyev </PERSON> recalls her saying. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, working at a beaten wooden desk now decorated with a single rose in a vase, taught philosophy from the ancient Greek times to the present. Her courses were mandatory for economic majors. `` She was respected greatly because she was the best prepared ... The rest of us went to her lectures to see how they should be done,'' <PERSON> Chuguyev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself entered the institute as a part-time student in 1962-68, working towards a degree as an `` advanced agro-economist,'' a speciality important for someone keen on rising in the party hierarchy in the farming region of <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION>. `` He asked for no special treatment, and was interested in pursuing the truth to the very end,'' remembers <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamensky </PERSON>, dean of part-time students at the institute and a friend of the Gorbachevs for decades. One day, in the midst of a four-hour chemistry experiment, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was whisked away by a limousine on urgent party business. But he returned later in the day, telling <PERSON> Kamensky </PERSON>, `` I want to finish the experiment by myself and see the results.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was born in 1931 to a peasant family in <LOCATION> Privolnoye </LOCATION>, a village on the black-earth steppes about 100 miles north of the <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> regional center. With his <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law diploma in his pocket, he returned to <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> in 1954 as an intern in the prosecutor's office But he was snapped up by the <ORGANIZATION> Komsomol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> youth league, and began a career that included stints as local <LOCATION> Komsomol </LOCATION> leader, party boss for the city of <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> and party chief for the <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> region, an area about the size of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was named regional party chief in 1970, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> went to her superiors at the agricultural institute, and asked not to be named head of the philosophy department, a promotion for which she had been in line. `` People will say that I've been promoted because of my husband,'' she told her co-workers. `` Not because of what I've done.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, welcomed to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by appreciative crowds and <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> pomp, began his fourth summit Sunday with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The leaders immediately clashed over human rights, setting the stage for what one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aide called `` tumultuous conversations.'' In receiving <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told his guest their previous meetings have shaken loose the `` enemy images'' of old stereotypes. He thanked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for having traversed `` the great distance that lies between our two capitals, to continue our political dialogue.'' He noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was finally visiting `` a country which you have so often mentioned in your public statements.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who once spoke of the Soviets as an `` evil empire,'' made clear that serious differences remain. `` We've traveled a long road together to reach this moment,'' the American president told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as they began the first of their talks. But he added, `` We both know it will not be easy'' to surmount obstacles standing stubbornly in the way of a pact to slash long-range nuclear weapons stocks. Instead of signing a treaty to cut strategic arsenals by 50 percent, which both sides had hoped would come at this meeting, the two leaders will ceremoniously exchange the final, ratified copies of the treaty they signed at their last meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: a far simpler agreement to scrap all medium-range nuclear missiles. As the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> retired for the evening, working groups of specialists in the major areas of U.S.-Soviet relations began separate negotations on outstanding issues with the understanding they would report any progress as the leaders' talks continue. Despite elaborate preparations by Soviet work crews and security forces, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> abandoned an unannounced plan for the president and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, to visit the home of a Jewish family whose 12-year-old daughter appealed to the Reagans for help in getting permission to leave the country. Instead, they toured the historic Arbat district by carriage before retiring to <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the nearby <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence where they are staying during the trip Crowds at the Arbat, roughly treated by frantic <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> security officers, cheered and applauded the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the leaders discussed human rights and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` frankly and with a good deal of energy'' during their first meeting, which lasted 1 hour, 11 minutes, about 20 minutes longer than scheduled. The White House aide said, `` Based on what we've seen so far, -LRB- subsequent talks -RRB- are going to be tumultuous conversations.'' `` They strike sparks off each other pretty well, and they did today,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. A senior American official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said human rights `` was one of the issues over which the two leaders differed, but not the only one.'' The same source said <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> also was discussed. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has indicated in recent days it might halt its troop withdrawal if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> does n't stop supplying arms to Afghan rebel. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters after the first meeting that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> assumes the Soviets will abide by their agreement, signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, to pull their forces out of the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> characterized the opening round of talks as businesslike and cordial, but he offered few details. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> charged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does not have a `` concrete understanding'' of the human rights issue in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and objected to others lecturing Soviets on how to conduct their affairs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s position `` is based on the past and does not take into consideration what is happening today,'' the spokesman said, apparently referring to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s somewhat more tolerant emigration policies and `` glasnost,'' which permits broader but still limited criticism of Soviet officialdom and society. The Foreign Ministry official said his government knew about its drawbacks. `` We are trying to correct'' them, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> added, `` but we don ` t like it when someone else is making us feel like a pupil.'' During a picture-taking session at the outset of his first meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked if he intended to lecture his counterpart on human rights. `` I have no intention of trying to be a teacher,'' he said. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, searching for ways to continue the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, suggested the superpowers might launch a joint manned mission to Mars or participate in an international conference or seminal on human rights. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been cool to both Soviet initiatives in the past. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, discussing the failure to reach agreement before the summit on nuclear testing and other pacts nearing completion, told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' that their not being signed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` underscores the careful and prudent way the administration is approaching this.

<HEAD>French Journalist Returns Home; Report Says Italian To Be Freed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> journalist returned home to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Sunday after nine months in `` absolutely deplorable conditions'' in an Afghan jail. A newspaper said an Italian journalist jailed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would soon be freed. <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillo </PERSON> was convicted on spy charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison in January. He was pardoned Friday and freed Saturday. The French <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper L'Humanite made available a report from its <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> correspondent saying that Italian journalist <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Biloslavo </PERSON> `` may be freed within two or three days.'' The report was for Monday's edition of the newspaper. <PERSON> Guillo </PERSON> spent part of his detention with <PERSON> Biloslavo </PERSON>, who was arrested in July and sentenced to seven years in prison. <PERSON> Guillo </PERSON> was arrested in August after entering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with guerrillas who are fighting the Soviet-backed government. `` The conditions of detention were rough, absolutely deplorable,'' Guillo, 45, told reporters at <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gaulle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> early Sunday. It was `` nine months of complete isolation,'' except for rare visits from the French charge d'affaires, he said. `` But it was nothing compared to the others. There is an Italian journalist, Turkish, Iranian, Pakistani prisoners. Their life is a real hell. They have no contact with their families. They are cut from the world.'' Guillo is an independent photojournalist who often worked for the Sygma agency covering the 10-year-old civil war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The secretary-general of the French <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Perol </PERSON>, stressed that obtaining his release should not be construed as an element of political negotiations with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Guillo's liberation was accompanied by `` no conditions, no commitment of any sort,'' <PERSON> Perol </PERSON> said. `` We have settled the Guillo case. Period.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the release followed a written request from <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and expressed hope for improved relations. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> maintains relations with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> but has made clear it does not support the government. Guillo is the sixth Frenchman jailed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since 1979. In each case, a pardon was eventually granted. Guillo was captured August 28 while traveling with members of the Afghan resistance on his ninth reporting trip to the country since 1979. His arrest was announced in September. On Jan. 4, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage and subversive activities. `` For 15 days, they -LRB- Afghan police -RRB- hesitated between killing me on the spot and arresting me formally,'' he told reporters Saturday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dehli </LOCATION>, where he stopped en route to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` They would have blamed the killing on the mujahedeen.'' The Afghan rebels call themselves mujahedeen, or holy warriors. <PERSON> Guillo </PERSON> called his trial `` pure comedy and a travesty of justice.'' In a televised interview with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> journalists earlier this month, <PERSON> Guillo </PERSON> said he would never ask for a pardon because he was not guilty and considered himself a hostage.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s husband has spent five years fighting to get three cigarette makers to pay for his wife's lung cancer death Very soon, he and the tobacco industry will have the answer in their landmark court battle. Testimony in the product liability trial is over, and after closing arguments this week, the jury will begin deliberating whether the $ 22 billion-a-year tobacco industry should be held responsible and pay its first dollar in damages. The four-month federal court trial has been monitored closely by both the industry and health groups, with both sides fighting for the attention of the nation's 50 million smokers. A verdict against the companies could clear the way for other lawsuits totaling millions of dollars in potential damages. To date, plaintiffs have not won a single cigarette liability case of the dozen or so that have gone to juries since World War II. Many other suits have been dismissed or withered in the face of defense efforts by the well-financed tobacco industry. But about 100 others are pending. `` Once the first case is won, then the tobacco folks ought to pack up their bags,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, director of governmental affairs for the American Cancer Society. Tobacco lawyers see little chance of a loss here, and years of appeals are almost certain if there is one. But for some anti-smoking forces, a victory already has been won. The case produced hundreds of previously secret internal corporate documents introduced as evidence and now available for litigators working against the tobacco industry. `` They show that the cigarette companies had knowledge of the problems with their products long before the general public was aware,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, lawyer who has 13 suits pending. Meanwhile, at least five bills are pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> placing stricter limits on the industry. The documents have garnered support for them, said <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>. After the lawyers' closing arguments, the case will go to six jurors chosen by lot from among the 11 who have heard the testimony. But they will consider few of the claims in the original complaint filed by <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> in 1983, a year before his wife died at 58. Most of <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s legal claims have been stripped away by defense efforts. But the fundamental issue appears straightforward: free will vs. corporate responsibility. To the defendants, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> was an intelligent, strong-willed woman who knew the risks as she made a conscious decision to smoke. To her husband, Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> was the unwitting victim of a broad conspiracy that used the advertising and public relations to confound the public on the dangers of smoking. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> threw out a number of liability claims, but he also said the jury can consider whether there was a `` tobacco industry conspiracy, vast in its scope, devious in its purpose and devastating in its results.'' The completion of the case comes as a relief to <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, a 64-year-old retired cable splicer whose tearful testimony about his wife's dying moments stirred courtroom observers. Most of documents at the core of the case were introduced as evidence for Cipollone by a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> physician and economist qualified as an expert on the history of tobacco company research. The exhibits include: _ Handwritten notes by a <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> research director in the 1970s saying an industry-funded research group's program was `` designed so that results can not harm us. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said that the writer was hypothesizing, and that the research was conducted objectively by independent scientists. _ A 1968 draft memo by another <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> research executive citing a `` gentleman's agreement'' not to do biological research on smoking and health Wall said no such agreement existed, and noted that some companies did do such research. _ A 1972 industry trade group executive's memo saying the defense against critics of smoking included `` creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it. Wall denied such a strategy and said the industry merely wanted to publicize the other side of a controversy. Whatever the documents say, the companies contend, they have nothing to do with <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>. First off, their expert medical witnesses testified that smoking is not a proven cancer cause. And in any case, they argued, Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s lung cancer was not the type associated with smoking. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edell </PERSON>, presented experts contending there is proof of the cancer-smoking link, pointing to numerous scientific findings and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surgeon general's reports. Both sides called marketing and advertising experts to testify about the messages Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> received on the effects of cigarettes. Experts disputed whether she was addicted to smoking. The jury heard testimony from top company executives, researchers and family members. And finally, through depositions, from <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> herself, a daughter of <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> immigrants who said she sought to ward off cancer with prayers to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jude </ORGANIZATION>, the patron saint of people in desperate trouble.

 President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> on Sunday dissolved the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, fired his prime minister and accused the lawmakers of failing to maintain law and order in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> made the announcement at a news conference minutes after the ousted prime minister, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>, returned home from a tour of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> also disbanded <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>'s 33-member Cabinet. The action could plunge the country into a new political crisis. <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>, 56, was heading the first civilian Cabinet after eight years of martial law imposed by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> in July 1977. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>'s Cabinet were scheduled to remain in office until 1990. They were elected in December 1984. <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> was appointed prime minister in March 1985. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, an army general who took power in a bloodless coup in 1977, told reporters that legislators' inability to maintain law and order and failure to bring about an Islamic society led him to disband the Assembly and Cabinet. He said the country's Constitution and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ the upper house of the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> _ would stay intact. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said that according to the Constitution, elections should be held within 90 days. He said a caretaker government would be announced Monday. In a major policy change, he said political parties will be permitted to propose their own candidates to contest the assembly seats. In the 1984 elections, political parties were not permitted to field candidates. That led opposition parties to boycott the vote. `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has failed to realize the objective for which it was elected,'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said. `` The prime minister has ceased to be the prime minister from today, because the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has been dissolved.'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> generally had got on well, but political observers had started sensing a divergence of views on domestic policy issues, particularly the role that political parties should play in the country. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> is opposed to giving political parties any immediate role, but <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> formed his own <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> party two years ago. Opposition political parties became active following the formation of <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>'s party. These parties include <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a particular source of annoyance to <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> is the daughter of the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, whose civilian government <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> toppled in July 1977. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said he had watched with concern that `` law and order had broken down to an alarming extent.'' `` There was enormous damage to life and property. ... The country's Islamic ideology and integrity were unsafe,'' he said. Public morality has deteriorated to an `` unprecedented level,'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> added. In the past two years, hundreds of people have died in ethnic violence in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s biggest city. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said that he had repeatedly reminded <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> to improve the law and order situation and to speed up the process of Islamization. But he said <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> took the view that he had to go along with the wishes of the Assembly, which favored a gradual move to Islamism.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> engaged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a lighthearted battle of Russian proverbs at their summit reunion Sunday, and made pointed reference to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s past enmity toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. At the start of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first visit to what he once called an `` evil empire,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> challenged his guest to learn more about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its people. `` You, Mr. President, have traversed the great distance that lies between our two capitals to continue our political dialogue,'' the Soviet leader said in a welcoming speech. He noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was finally visiting `` a country which you have so often mentioned in your public statements.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the steady improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations and more frequent meetings between superpower leaders was the result of patience. Then he reached for a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> proverb to put his thoughts into words. `` Rodilsya, ne toropilsya -LRB- It was born, it was n't rushed -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, reading from a notecard. The president initiated the exchange of proverbs at his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in December, when he referred to the quandary of arms control negotiations. `` Doveryai, no proveryai -LRB- trust, but verify -RRB-,'' he said. Greeting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Sunday in the Kremlin's opulent St. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s Hall, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took note of his guest's fondness for literary references `` Aware of your interest in Russian proverbs, let me add another one to your collection,'' he said. `` It is better to see once than to hear a hundred times.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s advice came after an oblique reference to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s critical remarks in the past about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which the president had never visited <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aroused the wrath of the Soviet media and government officials in 1983 when he told an American television audience that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was an `` evil empire.'' But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed Sunday that times have changed since their first summit in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in November 1985. `` As we see it, long-held dislikes have been weakened; habitual stereotypes stemming from enemy images have been shaken loose,'' the Soviet leader said. `` Everyone can improve, even in later years,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affairs expert <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' program as he tried to explain why <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s views of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had changed. On the eve of his arrival here, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a Soviet television broadcast that he could not have conceived of visiting <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during the early years of his presidency. `` I think there is a difference between this general secretary and other leaders of your country that I've met with in the past,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the state-run broadcast service. `` No, I could not have foreseen your present leader.''

 For most of the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the 2 -LCB- - month-old strike has been a stressful time of picket lines, union meetings, no paychecks and lost creative opportunity For the writers of `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>,'' being on strike has been, well, not that different from going to work. `` We sleep till noon,'' said head writer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, `` get up, drink some coffee, go down to the Writers Guild, see if anything's going on, then we go home. But now, during the strike ...'' Until one-liners earn them money again _ which should be soon, since `` Late Night'' has reached a tentative independent agreement with the guild _ the show's writers have been offering them in magazine pieces or interviews with reporters looking for that missed-monologue angle on the strike story. The show has been in reruns since the strike started March 7. <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, joined by `` Late Night'' staffers <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, reminisced Friday about a typical day of work at the show. `` We come down to beautiful, almost-landmark Rockefeller Center at 9:30 or 10 and linger until it's quite dark outside,'' said <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. `` It's hand-to-mouth. We're usually working on the next day's show, if not that day's show, the day of the broadcast. So that's why we're not too worried about stockpiling things up. Sometimes our days are not too miserable, because sometimes a lot of our writing consists of a sentence. Something like ...'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>: `` ` Let's go up and talk to our audience.''' `` Perfect,'' says <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. `` See, then we knock off and go get the thickest steak in town. ... Or other times, it will just be a phrase, a concept, a man, a plan, a canal, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>: `` ` <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> says something funny.''' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>: `` ` <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> takes bullhorn to window and tries to get pedestrian to bring him up a hot dog.' Then we look at each other and say, ` That's it, that's it. Who's for dessert?''' But now, there are picket lines to walk. `` There is like just a minimum of actual union activities,'' said <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. `` We go picketing once a week. `` I think people passing by as they see these writers in their not-very-solid-looking picket lines, I think they have a series of thoughts _ the first is, do writers have a union? And then, do they work that hard? And then perhaps the last stage is, wait a second. TV writers get paid plenty! `` I do n't think a lot of people understand the strike was n't for more money, it was to keep royalties from being cut back.'' `` Wait a second,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, `` it was n't for more money?'' `` What the hell have we been doing?'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who has been playing golf. But seriously. `` We certainly support the guild,'' said <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. `` If it was n't for them, we'd certainly be in bad shape. But the actual issues in this strike do not pertain to late-night comedy writers.'' `` It's a nice little vacation,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. But life on strike means missing important events in the life of `` Late Night.'' Just that morning, the local papers were splashed with <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s smiling file-photo face next to headlines about a `` mystery woman'' driving his car who told officials at the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION>, where she did n't have the toll, that she was `` Mrs. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>.'' `` Usually <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> has to go on a murder spree to make the front page of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. And he recommends, `` if you're going to steal <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>'s car, please, please have correct change.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Bosko </PERSON> <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> said Sunday that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s political stability has been shaken, and he warned of major social upheavals as a result of the country's economic crisis. But <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> rejected a multi-party system and other radical reforms in a speech to about 800 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> delegates meeting to find ways of dealing with <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s social and financial problems. `` We are, I should say, in the epicenter of the crisis with economic stagnation on the brink of a recession, a high inflation that threatens to run away, and ever sharper social problems and political dissatisfaction,'' said <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is saddled with a 170 percent inflation, a $ 21 billion foreign debt and a 15 percent unemployment rate. The three-day conference comes halfway between two party congresses and follows rumors of an attempted military coup to suppress dissent in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most advanced republic. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> this month filed an unsuccessful motion in the federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> requesting the removal of Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>. `` A society which enters such a crisis ... can not emerge from it without profound changes,'' said the party chief. `` Social upheavals are certain to take place and may be grave.'' The government launched an emergency economic program on Saturday, including an almost 24 percent devaluation of the ever-weaker national currency, the dinar, hefty price hikes and wage cuts of up to 30 percent. <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> said these measures `` are not easy at all, but are causing and will cause many shocks, clashes of interest, great social problems.'' The austerity package was expected to further erode sagging living standards, which have already dipped by one-third since 1980, and set off a new wave of social unrest. Sporadic worker strikes have flared in various parts of the country to protest of the belt-tightening moves, which were announced several weeks ago. `` The stability of the political system has been shaken,'' <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> told the delegates. Conference documents pledge a separation of party and state administration, curbs on red tape and more openness. In a draft document circulated before the meeting, the party membership is called `` to end the party's impotence and inertia and oppose bureaucratic and static rule which is believed to be the main cause of numerous deformations and failures.'' The document demands that the party `` abandon its leadership role and -LRB- instead -RRB- act as a leading force in society, whose major goals are freedom, democracy and the material well-being of the people.'' But <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> rejected changes toward a multi-party system and other radical reforms as a way of regaining control of the economy. He made clear that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> intends to continue its one-party rule and a system of self-management that provides for limited worker power-sharing in managing companies. The party chief asserted it was the historic mission of Yugoslav Communists `` not to permit the blind forces to gain the upper hand or changes which, regardless of intentions, would objectively mean abandoning self-management.'' <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> claimed that recent calls for a new constitution and a reshaping of the political system according to Western models `` are in fact counterrevolutionary.'' He said the current system `` must keep the gates tightly shut'' to solutions leading to a dogmatic, Soviet-type system, on the one hand, or to a Western-type, multi-party democracy, on the other. <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> also revealed the party was exposed to pressures from `` the bourgeois right wing, which pulls toward restoration of the capitalistic relationship and bourgeois democracy'' He said such changes of the political system `` would lead us to national conflicts, which are known from the past.'' Neverthless, <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> said one of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most important tasks was the establishment of a free market for capital and workers, which is a highly controversial topic among Yugoslav Communists. For some party officials, he said _ referring to the dogmatic party wing opposed to a free-market economy _ such an innovation is tantamount to `` anarchy'' and the abandonment of socialism. <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> said the view, espoused by many party hard-liners, that use of foreign capital for increasing industrial production was a threat to socialist ownership, was unacceptable. Compounding <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economic problems are unresolved ethnic tensions in this mostly-Balkan nation, whose republics range from the southern <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> _ with its 85 percent <LOCATION> Albanian </LOCATION> population _ to northern <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, which borders on <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. In an open letter published Thursday, 22 Slovenian officials, including government members, journalists and other intellectuals, demanded a thorough explanation of this spring's rumored military coup, which they called the `` crudest violation of assured rights of citizens and of the current constitution'' of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The government said the coup rumors were false.

 Soviet Jewish activists urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Sunday to drive a hard bargain for free Jewish emigration when he meets with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` The Soviets will not be persuaded by mere words,'' <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>, a former Soviet labor camp inmate, said during a rally for Soviet Jews attended by about 200 people in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> and other activists demanded that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> link trade agreements and scientific and cultural exchanges to the level of Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The activists also described <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness, as a public relations stunt that has not led to real improvements for Soviet Jews. `` More than 2 million Jews remain in one big labor camp _ the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ and the door is still closed,'' said <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, a member of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s Cabinet and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> called on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to use the level of Jewish emigration as a test for Soviet sincerity on other issues, such as arms control. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that `` we have seen very few -LRB- Soviet -RRB- changes,'' but added that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was satisfied with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s efforts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the plight of Soviet Jewry would be on the summit agenda. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was to meet Monday with a group of prominent `` refuseniks,'' Soviet Jews denied permission to emigrate. <PERSON> Refusenik </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Dashevsky </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that he viewed his scheduled meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a sign that the president assigned importance to the issue. `` We want to tell him that even though positive things have been done in the past two years, basic problems remain and the situation is not good at all,'' said <PERSON> Dashevsky </PERSON>, who has been denied an exit visa for the past 11 years. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has released several prominent Jewish activists from prisons and labor camps in the past year. Last year, 8,011 Jews left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the highest number since 1981. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> severed ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war during which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured territory from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> allies. In the past year, the Soviets sent a consular delegation to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and approved a reciprocal visit by Israeli diplomats.

 Some politicians in Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fear that a newly chosen slate of dovish candidates could cost them the national elections in November. Their concern was triggered by a meeting of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday in which more than half of 29 candidates chosen to run for parliament favor making more concessions to the Arabs for peace than the party has advocated in the past. The party's dovish turn appears to contradict a recent shift in <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> public opinion polls, which show a majority support right-wing Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and his allies in espousing a tougher stand toward the Arabs. `` I am definitely worried by the change. The fact is, more doves than expected were elected, and this will harm us very much in the elections,'' Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehamkin </PERSON> said. Those on Labor's new slate include several peace activists and a former ultra left-wing legislator, <PERSON> Lova </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON>, who has had contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and has advocated a full Israeli pullout from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The latest public opinion poll, taken this month and published May 13 by the Yediot Ahronot daily, showed <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and allied parties winning 59 seats. The Likud and its allies were predicted to win 61. After <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s last elections, in 1984, the Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> parties formed a coalition in which <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> served as prime minister for the first two years and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for the past two years. Political analysts say Israelis' swing to the right reflects a hawkish public mood stirred by the six-month-old Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The analysts say that the Labor infighting could further damage the party's electoral image by presenting a confused picture to the public. `` With such a fractious and contradictory slate it will be difficult to formulate an attention-grabbing campaign to compete with parties either to the left or the right,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> daily. The doves and hawks in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are divided over how to implement a plank in its platform which calls for giving up some land occupied in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> War in exchange for peace with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states. The hawks favor a formula which would leave <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a stand unacceptable to Arabs. They also completely reject negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Labor's newest candidates have a more lenient approach to territorial compromise and some favor talking with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if it officially recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I think that Labor is back where it should be, on the road of looking for peace, that peace has a price and you do n't get it without compromising,'' said Russian-born <PERSON> Lova </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON>, 66. He predicted a tough Israeli election campaign over the peace issue. `` People are extreme, dangerously so. I think it's time for voters to choose a party that wants to take the road for peace, even if it's a very, very uphill road,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The heiress to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s most famous modern fortune and one of the Republican establishment's favorite sons are vying for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination to challenge Democratic incumbent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, a former governor, for his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat. On June 14, Republican voters in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s 1st Congressional District will choose between businesswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean-Jones </PERSON>, a granddaughter of L.L. Bean, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> `` Ted'' <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON>, the executive assistant to the state's popular senior senator, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. Both candidates are making their first bid for public office. With a campaign fund 10 times the size of <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Bean-Jones </PERSON> is far better financed, partly because she has loaned her campaign $ 168,000. Much of that war chest has been spent on television advertising, which emphasizes her links to the sporting goods empire founded by her grandfather and plays down her background as a conservative publisher and activist. `` I'm prepared to spend whatever it takes to win,'' she said. <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON> is little known outside <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> inner circles and is counting on support from <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> regulars to win next month's primary But he has been hampered by a tradition of neutrality in primary campaigns, which has limited the activities of some of his natural allies, including Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> and even <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> himself. Publicly, however, <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON> is undaunted. `` Never once did I ask them for an endorsement,'' <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON> said. `` I never had any expectation of it. I never wanted to put them in the position of having to get involved in the primary.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary winner will face <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, a former two-term governor, in November's general election for his 1st District seat, which represents 563,073 residents in an area about the size of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, who was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 as he concluded eight years as governor, is unopposed for the Democratic nomination. Also unopposed in the primary is <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, who is winding up her fifth term as the 2nd District incumbent. The Democrats have lined up former state Sen. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, who teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orono </LOCATION>, to challenge her in the general election. <PERSON> Bean-Jones </PERSON>, 46, is perhaps best known as founder of the ultraconservative <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Paper, a weekly publication which folded in 1982 after three years. She also played a role in the successful campaign to defeat an Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution, and traveled to an arms control meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to support President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative Her focus on issues has changed since announcing her candidacy. Now she refers to herself as `` the private sector candidate'' who wants to eliminate many small-business regulations. She is against higher taxes and abortion, but favors helping women on welfare find jobs by providing day care, and she said she approves the expanded use of nuclear power. Since becoming a candidate she also has adopted her family surname, saying, `` I cherish the connection. It embodies what I am today.'' <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON>, 36, is a seasoned organizer, having worked on several gubernatorial and congressional campaigns. He was an aide to <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> before taking a position in 1981 with <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, for whom he has served as campaign finance director. He now is in charge of the senator's six offices in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON> said he favors reductions in the federal deficit, is pro-choice on abortion, favors the Equal Rights Amendment and wants action, not further study, to curb acid rain pollution.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet press said Sunday that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had made a `` turnaround'' on East-West relations in the past three years, resulting from a fresh look at changing world realities rather than a reversal of his staunch anti-communist views. One commentator said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has high hopes for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fourth summit meeting with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but another said progress will depend largely on whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approach is `` realistic and constructive. Soviet television pre-empted regular programming for a live broadcast of the president's arrival at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Vnukovo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and his initial meeting with the Soviet leader in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. An expanded, 90-minute version of the evening news program `` Vremya'' devoted a full 52 minutes to the summit, rerunning much of the welcoming ceremony at the airport and the speeches by both leaders. It also carried more than two minutes on <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tour of the Cathedral of the Assumption conducted by <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, giving rare prominence to the wife of a Soviet leader `` Vremya'' carried a lengthy interview with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He dismissed past anti-Soviet speeches by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` propaganda.'' `` I didn ` t see in them any serious political topics,'' <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON> said. `` It was what is called in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ` public relations,' and in many cases, of course, unconvincing propaganda.'' `` Vremya'' also took to the streets for public opinion on the summit. Many people spoke of hopes for peace and lessening the nuclear threat, although one man scolded the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for raising human rights issues. `` They should report on their own human rights problems before discussing ours,'' the unidentified man told the `` Vremya'' interviewer. State-run newspapers printed traffic restrictions that will be in effect until <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves the Soviet capital on Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda printed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s official portrait and biography in the bottom right corner of its front page, as is customary for visiting heads of state. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said that `` the biographies of a son of a shoe dealer from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and a son of a peasant from the <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> region represent ... the essence of the two opposite ways of life.'' Said Tass: `` This is going to be a meeting of two fundamentally different social systems with their own values, ideals and priorities. The relations between them determine to a large extent the fate of the whole planet.'' In a separate dispatch, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> diplomatic correspondent <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Biryukov </PERSON> wrote: `` Just three years ago, there was hardly anyone who could imagine that the 40th American president, known for his anti-Communist views and power approaches to the solution of problems on the international scene, would be the high representative of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that would sign a Soviet-U.S. intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty and moreover, bring to the Soviet capital the first document on nuclear arms reduction in history, ratified by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Senate.'' `` Does it mean that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leader has changed his views?'' <PERSON> Biryukov </PERSON> asked. `` Perhaps it would be more correct to describe this turnaround as a result of understanding the fact that the world has changed and that the interests of our countries are changing. And the president has probably taken a fresh look at the existing realities without giving up his known views.'' <PERSON> Biryukov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` pins its most serious hopes'' on the summit meeting. Pravda said summit progress depends largely on `` how realistic and constructive'' is <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approach. <PERSON> Biryukov </PERSON> wrote that since the December summit talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not allowed any progress toward agreement on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> plan for a space-based shield against nuclear attack. The Soviets regard the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> as a violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

<HEAD>Political Stars Wrong For Reagan-Thatcher Meeting, Astrologer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s leading astrologers says the stars are wrong for this week's post-summit meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, an Aquarian, and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, a Libran, `` enjoy a marvelous cerebral relationship'' with all the right ingredients to get things done, but this is n't the week to do them, said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, president emeritus of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astrological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Press Association, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, said Sunday it commissioned the forecast from <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Thursday and Friday, with Mercury starting to go backwards through the planetary system, comes during a `` very unstable period.'' The president flies to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after his meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` If he has got an astrologer advising him, I would have steered clear of this period more than any other time in the year,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. `` You could reach an agreement today, and in a month's time people could renege on it,'' he said. `` What is going on at the moment is so volatile and so unpredictable that you really can not stand by what is said.'' But the astrologer said the intuitive powers of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a shrewd Cancerian, could be `` invaluable'' during the president's <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> visit He said <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a Taurus who is having a tea for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Buckingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, would also be a positive influence. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interest in astrology made headlines around the world this month when former White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> published a book alleging that the first lady's astrological advice affected the president's schedule. The president has denied this.

<TEXT>
 A soul food restaurant it is n't, although some patrons might wonder about souls wafting through the rooms of a soon-to-open eatery converted from a funeral home. `` I have not encountered any negative reaction from the local people about it,'' <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, co-owner of the new restaurant, <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, said recently. `` The local folks have dropped in and they seem to be very excited about it.'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, 47, one of three owners of the former <ORGANIZATION> Jacoby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' Funeral Home, said holding part-time jobs as a cook when he was younger in order to supplement his teacher's salary piqued his interest in restaurants So April 29, <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, and two other <ORGANIZATION> Alton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> employees _ one a school teacher and the other a custodian _ bought the building for $ 65,500. Though reaction has been positive, at least one local restaurant owner wonders whether eating at <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, set to open in mid-June, will be hard to swallow. `` I could see where it might raise some questions. Some people it might bother if they're kind of squeamish anyway,'' said <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, who manages Grandmother's Kitchen. She says eating at the restaurant would n't bother her. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Goforth </PERSON>, the local postmaster, said: `` This business about a funeral home does n't seem to be a big deal because the town's so small, there's probably nobody in the funeral home more than five times a year. `` In a small town,'' she explained, `` you go to the funeral ... the church and somebody has a big meal afterward.'' And anyway, she added, `` The majority of the people will be tourist types. The ones who live here are n't the superstitious type.'' The white-frame building with spacious rooms was built around 1900. It has been home to <ORGANIZATION> Grafton </ORGANIZATION>'s mayor and the village dentist and was converted to a funeral home about 15 years ago. The 2,500-square-foot restaurant will hold about 200 customers. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> says The Gables menu will be moderately priced and feature seafood and chicken. He expects most patrons will be tourists visiting the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town of 1,000 about 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said the he plans to include a brief history of the building on the menu, including its funereal past. And he stressed that <PERSON> Jacoby </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON>' was only a `` viewing parlor,'' and mortuary work was done elsewhere. `` I think we'll get over our hurdle _ if there's any hurdle at all,'' he said.

 A nine-month-old girl, who officials say is the first infant ever to receive a second heart transplant, remained in critical condition early Sunday, a nursing supervisor said. <PERSON> Kiersten </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb of Flower Mound, received a new heart during 4 -LCB- hours of surgery at Children's <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. Her body rejected the first transplant, which she received April 12. She was in critical condition in the hospital's intensive care unit, where she was expected to remain for three or four days, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>. A spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where the first infant heart transplant was performed in 1985, said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was the first infant to undergo a second transplant. `` Unless I'm missing something, that would be a first,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've kept up with these things, and we'd know if there was another one out there. `` The operation went well.

<DATELINE>ABOARD USS VINCENNES IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The commander of this super-sophisticated warship says its presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> gives <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials many new options, including reducing the number of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels. `` I think that it really gives the tactical commanders here in the gulf an opportunity to pick and choose as they see fit,'' Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said in an interview on the bridge of the 9,400-ton <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> on was on its first trip north through the gulf. Its arrival in the waterway was part of an extensive turnover in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s gulf-based force planned for the next several days. At least 10 ships are involved in the rotation, announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in April. The San Diego-based <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> is the first of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s billion-dollar Aegis missile cruisers to be deployed as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> operating in the gulf The Aegis system is an array of powerful radars and missile weaponry linked with computers to enable a single ship to manage a widespread battle, carrying out dozens of radar surveillance and firing missions at the same time. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have not explained why the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, designed primarily for carrier battle group defense in the open ocean, is being assigned to the gulf, where its long reach and massive clout would appear to exceed any current threat posed to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s convoy escort operations or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests Some <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> officers and crew members say privately they are puzzled by the deployment. The ship was abruptly pulled out of a naval exercise off <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. After less than four days in port to prepare, it made a 13,000-mile high-speed dash to the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in 32 days. The Vincennes' varied capabilities can make it the equivalent of several other warships in a combat situation, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. `` It can be a force multiplier. On the other side of the coin, because of these capabilities, to manage an area as large as the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, virtually as far as its surveillance capabilities, it can be a force reducer as well,'' he said. Asked whether the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was considering a cut in the 17 warships it has in the gulf, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> said that was `` above my pay grade, but there certainly is an option there.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> both have attacked neutral ships during the `` tanker war,'' a four-year spinoff of their 7 -LCB- - year gulf war More than 500 commercial vessels have been damaged, several have been sunk and more than 300 seamen have died during the tanker war. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who earlier described <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as a `` low-level threat'' in the gulf, said the armed speedboats used by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to raid neutral shipping, usually in reprisal for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air attacks, can not be disregarded. `` Small craft are always difficult targets, and a dedicated attack by anyone who wants to press it home is a difficult problem to deal with, regardless of the capabilities of the defender,'' he said. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said his ship would stay alert, but `` at the same time I do n't want to give the impression that we're leaning forward on our toes to get a major conflagration started here, because that's not the case at all.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the gulf recently was expanded to allow <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships to intervene in attacks on vessels not flying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has carried out four such raids since then, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say no American warships were close enough to get involved. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, a native of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, despite its high-tech radar and weapons, is as vulnerable as other warships to mines, `` and that basically is where our prime concern is.''

 The valedictorian at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> was a bit wistful at last week's graduation as he recalled some of the problems his class faced at one of the parish's single-sex secondary schools During freshman year, the boys in his class had to cope with intimidation from upperclassmen, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanco </PERSON> said. `` In our sophomore year, we had another problem to deal with _ females. They were everywhere but in the school,'' he said. <PERSON> Zanco </PERSON>'s successor will be spared that lament because next year the four high schools in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> will go co-educational for the first time in a generation. The change was sparked by a lawsuit won last year by a parent last year who wanted his son and daughter to attend the same school. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s suit said his children were victims of discrimination because they were n't being taught the same things. Calls to Wall's home went unanswered Sunday. Court-ordered racial desegregation of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> schools helped lead to the sexual segregation of St. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON>'s high schools 22 years ago. The parish was a magnet for so-called `` white flight'' from the inner city, and the population boom strapped the school board's budget To economize, school officials decided to split high schools by sex, building sports stadiums at boys' schools and home economics labs at girls schools. `` At the time, we thought we were doing the taxpayers a service,'' <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said. `` It all went off quite well. In those days, there were n't many boys trying to be cheerleaders. And being a secretary was still thought of as a job for girls. So there was no reason to have a big stenographic lab for boys _ they just were n't going to sign up for it.'' School Board President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said the reversion to co-education wo n't be cheap. A no-frills conversion _ modifying bathrooms, adding extra equipment and duplicating courses _ will cost the board about $ 300,000, he said. `` Financially, it's going to be devastating this year,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. `` But the staff is ready. And the kids are ready.'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a supervisor with St. Bernard Parish schools, looked forward to the change. `` It teaches kids to socialize better. And it's my personal observation that students tend to behave a bit better,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Woos Environmental Support In New Jersey; Prepares For

 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wooed environmentalists Sunday while campaigning in advance of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s primary and prepared to meet with black supporters to plot a national strategy for the fall. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, apparently confident of a win here June 7, made only two public appearances, taking a boat cruise with environmentalists before heading to a barbecue. As the S.S. Miss Belmar prepared to head out into polluted ocean waters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a small gathering at the docks that as president he would forcefully direct cleanup programs. `` I'm going to do everything I can as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... to make sure that our oceans and our rivers and our coastlines are what they ought to be,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He said a strong federal environmental policy is particularly needed in areas like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which blames much of the pollution in its waters on neighboring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Ironically, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appointee who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> office had to get a court order to speed up the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administration's cleanup of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, the nation's filthiest harbor `` Nobody is without sin,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, conceding he was wrong to delay the cleanup, which will cost more than $ 3 billion. While aboard the boat, members of local environmental groups showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a harbor chart marked in areas polluted by sewage, sludge and trash dumping. Less than a mile off one public beach a brown film covered the water, which was strewn with floating garbage. `` It's pretty disgusting,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denounced the dumping of raw sewage into waterways and said the nation's trash-disposal problem could be eased with vastly expanded recycling and conservation programs. He also spoke in favor of new, biodegradeable plastics made from corn and other crops. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who hopes to lock up the Democratic nomination with wins in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on the final primary day, also attended three private receptions, a gathering with Hispanic leaders, an environmental forum and a reception for a state senator running for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He was to return home to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Sunday night and meet Monday morning with about 60 black supporters from across the country before attending local Memorial Day services.. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has conceded the black vote to rival Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> throughout the primary season In recent weeks, however, he has begun to actively seek black support, which is seen a critical in order to defeat the expected <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ particularly in closely contested Southern states. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on Sunday, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was conducting private meetings with advisers at his summer home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Polls have shown <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a wide lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> here. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> later this week before heading back to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to campaign through primary day. He also plans to make stops in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which also hold June 7 primaries.

 Hundreds of Syrian troops with automatic weapons patrolled the slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Sunday, and a leading Shiite Moslem cleric pledged to work for the release of foreign hostages believed held there. `` Although I possess no great means of pressure, I shall exert continuous efforts to resolve the question of the hostages,'' Sheikh <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, spiritual guide of the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying. `` I am viewing the hostages' issue from both humanitarian and Islamic standpoints. It is hurting our credibility,'' the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Ad-Dijar </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> as saying in an interview published Sunday. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> has made several such pledges in the past three years. Although <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, has publicly denied involvement in the kidnappings, the group is widely believed to be an umbrella for underground factions that are holding the hostages. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, an informed Syrian source said the hostages were not part of a Syrian-Iranian deal under which the Syrian army intervened Friday to halt a three-week battle between rival <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militias that killed 300 people and wounded 1,000. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s information minister, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Salman </PERSON>, said Saturday that `` there is no timetable for the release of the hostages.'' <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was seeking to establish a central authority in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, ravaged by 13 years of civil war. `` Unless we reach that, there will not be presidential elections,'' he said, warning of a constitutional vacuum after President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term ends in September. A Syrian command source said Saturday that <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> soldiers would remain outside the <LOCATION> Hay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, which harbors the main barracks of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the 18 foreign hostages, including nine Americans, were believed to be held in the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> barracks. The hostage held longest is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. A Lebanese security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Syrian deployment around <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON> would stop kidnappers from moving `` the hostages from one place to another.'' The Syrians, armed with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, moved into the south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> suburbs after the fighting between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the pro-Syrian Amal militia. During the fighting, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> seized control of more than 90 percent of the 16-square-mile enclave from Amal. <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> said Saturday that Syrian troops would withdraw `` within a few days'' and leave security in the hands of Lebanese police. But on Sunday <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> said he meant that they would be withdrawn gradually and only as the security situation allowed. He said Syrian troops will remain stationed at eight points on the perimeter of the area and be on constant alert to move in `` when security demands or when requested by the Lebanese security forces.'' He also said the Syrians have no plans to disarm either Amal or <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>.

 The threat of ring-around-the-collar looms for this popular summer resort, whose only coin-operated laundry has been closed since September and whose nearest launderette is 26 miles away. `` I have one friend I allow to use my washer and I limit it at that,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, an aide to Town Manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>. `` But I know 10 who'd like to.'' The town's elderly have already felt the inconvenience, <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> said. But this community at the outer tip of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> has its population of 4,000 increase to 45,000 during the summer. That has McNulty worried. `` I foresee a serious impact on the town's economy and vitality if there is n't some remediation,'' <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> closed the laundry in September after his septic system failed. State officials gave him three choices: Haul out the waste water by truck, build a treatment plant for about $ 300,000, or close. He closed. Since the nearest coin-operated laundry is 26 miles away in <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, two women may clean up because of <LOCATION> Provincetown </LOCATION>'s problem. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ersoy </PERSON>, 29, began their laundry service, Wash Day Blues, two years ago. They get up each morning at 4, load a van with about 500 pounds of dirty laundry and drive 32 miles to <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION> to wash it. They charge $ 1.35 a pound for the service, and a $ 2 fee for pickup and delivery. Regular, year-round customers get a better price and do n't pay for delivery. Their work day ends about 6 p.m., but may extend to 11 p.m. when the summer season gets into full swing. `` People think there's great money in this, but then they find out it's a lot more work for the money you make,'' said <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>. `` Other people have started laundry businesses, but by midseason they say, ` Goodbye.'''

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded nine Arabs in clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Sunday, and about 60 Palestinians were treated for tear gas and rubber bullet injuries, hospital officials said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, classes resumed for about 70,000 Arab junior high school students. Sunday marked the second stage of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s plan to reopen 1,200 schools shut nearly four months ago because of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising Israeli officials have said they are reopening schools because the uprising, which began Dec. 8, has quieted. A militant Jewish settler said her car was stoned by about 150 schoolgirls near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qalqiliya </LOCATION> and that she had to fire into the air before the army rescued her. <PERSON> Daniella </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, a leading figure in the Gush Emunim -LRB- Bloc of the Faithful -RRB- settlement movement, criticized the army for reopening the schools. `` There is no justification for allowing them to go back to regular studies because they are becoming a terrorist force,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. The worst violence was in the isolated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Jaba </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Military sources and hospital officials said troops wounded seven Palestinians with live bullets. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports as saying an Arab woman died in the clash but the army denied the report. The sources said the clash occurred when protesters blocked the road to <LOCATION> Jaba </LOCATION> with stones and threw rocks at a patrol trying to get in. The soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets but opened fire with live ammunition after the protesters refused to disperse. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Bazzariya </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, an officer shot and wounded an Arab villager after the man attacked him with a cement block at a roadblock set up by protesters, the army said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a 29-year-old man was in serious condition at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after being shot by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops who fired on stone-throwers in the Shati refugee camp, hospital officials said. On Saturday night, youths threw stones and firebombs in nearby <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> camp, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. About 60 people were treated for injuries at the camp clinic. A taxi was set ablaze in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and rocks were thrown at passing cars. At least 198 Arabs and two Israelis have died in the six months of unrest. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, about 300 middle or junior high schools opened, a week after classes resumed in elementary schools and kindergartens. High schools are to reopen next week. At one middle school for girls in <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION>, the principal showed a reporter damage that she said was done by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers who used the school as a headquarters. She spoke on condition that her name and the name of the school not be used. In one room, obscenities about Arabs were written on walls in Hebrew with an orange crayon. The Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON> and the word `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> also were scrawled on several classroom walls. <PERSON> Samira </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON>, a mother of two teen-age daughters, said parents were worried about <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers stationed near Palestinian schools. `` It's quiet now. Why are the soldiers outside the schools?'' she asked. `` They want the boys and girls to throw stones at them.'' A young girl in a school uniform was asked if she thought reopening schools signaled quieter times. `` I do n't think so, because even the uprising people want us to go back to class,'' she said. A spokesman for the military government in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> said that the government is expected to free from prison dozens of youths ages 14 to 18 who were arrested in demonstrations and want to return to classes. `` This is a goodwill gesture on our part,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafowicz </PERSON>. `` We think it could help in a kind of normalization.''

 <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wishes <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women and their families `` peaceful and clear skies over our planet'' in a message the Soviet first lady sent to Time magazine. `` The more we learn about the life of the peoples of our countries today, their concerns and their aspirations, the sooner we will have a better understanding of one another,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wrote. The magazine said Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sent the unsolicited message after learning that Time was preparing an article on contemporary Soviet women. `` I retain warm memories of the meetings I had with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December 1987,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` Quite a number of differences stand between us.

The letter went on to describe Soviet women's contributions to the history of their country, `` marked by striking selflessness and self-sacrifice, by boundless kindness and charity.'' `` Our women know the price of war and peace. They are ardent and convinced champions of peace,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wrote. `` Today the Soviet woman is proud of her participation in ` perestroika,' in the renewal of society. There are grounds for this. Perestroika is distinguished by a vigorous social policy. This is very important for improving people's everyday life and family life and for the upbringing of children.'' The letter concludes: `` I sincerely wish the readers of Time, all <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women and their families peaceful and clear skies over our planet, and happiness.''

<HEAD>Baker: Meese Could Hurt Bush's Presidential Prospects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Sunday that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> still has confidence in Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> but believes <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal problems could harm <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> politically. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` certainly does n't have a closed mind'' about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, but the chief of staff added: `` It would take an extraordinary event to shake that confidence that the president still has in the attorney general.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' was questioned about reports that Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would like to see <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> leave the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and said that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opinions carry weight in the administration, `` the president must decide these issues himself.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> acknowledged <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s problems could hurt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election prospects, but added that `` the show is n't over yet,'' noting that independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has yet to report the results of his investigation of the attorney general's financial dealings. `` Let's give <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> his opportunity to rebut whatever allegations, if any, are made in the McKay report before we make a final judgement on its ultimate political impact,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Asked if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shares <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s judgement that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s woes could hurt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> politically, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said: `` Oh, I think so _ for the moment and to some degree. But I think that he too would urge you to wait and see how all this unfolds and develops.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wooed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> environmentalists Sunday while rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued his attacks on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's drug policy as the primary campaign headed into the final stretch. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, vacationing in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, again met with advisers to map out his November strategy. With the four remaining primaries just over a week away, the two Democrats spent their Memorial Day weekend campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which has 109 delegates at stake. All told, 466 delegates are up for grabs on June 7 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is within striking distance of the 2,081 needed to nominate with 1,711 delegates. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has 984 delegates. Front-runner <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who leads <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in recent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> opinion polls, took a boat cruise with environmentalists and also attended three private receptions. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inspected polluted waters off <LOCATION> Asbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.. saying: `` It's pretty disgusting. He promised to work aggressively to direct environmental cleanup programs, but acknowledged that his own state's efforts to clean up dirty <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> had gotten off to a slow start. While the candidate campaigned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> televised a taped interview with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in which the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s economic problems led <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to another summit with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is probably the first Soviet leader `` to recognize that communism is a failure, at least the way it's been practiced in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' `` Unless the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> begins to devote significantly more resources to its domestic economy ... and less to the military, than they're going to become a third-rate economic power,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> BCC </ORGANIZATION> last week while he campaigned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said `` most thoughtful observers agree that it is the very serious condition of the Soviet domestic situation that has been largely responsible'' for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s involvement in the summit <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, meanwhile, renewed his criticisms of the administration's decision to negotiate with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who faces charges of drug trafficking. `` They're negotiating with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for silence,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a breakfast fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> and church-goers at the New Hope Baptist Church. The Democratic candidate suggested that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tried to work out a deal to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power to silence him before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would like to see <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> silenced before the general election in November. With the last round of primaries approaching, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was acknowledging that his campaign was nearing its end. `` When the race is over June 7, life goes on June 8,'' he said, but added: `` We should never forget this campaign.'' He also noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been raising the drug issue, and suggested that his own emphasis on the issue was responsible for the vice president's interest. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has thanked me but he should ask me how to do it because he does n't know how,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Now that I've set the agenda, I want to work out the plan.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is spending the week at his vacation retreat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, met with his close advisers Sunday to continue mapping his strategy for the November election. The likely Republican nominee's showing in recent opinion polls, in which he trails <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a one-on-one match-up _ in double digits in some surveys _ has advisers worried about his prospects. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with Republican Govs. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on Saturday to plan how to depart from some <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies. `` The vice president is a man firmly committed to setting his own agenda,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said after the meeting. `` I do n't think there was any doubt about that at all.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said `` the domestic side is going to be one of the strong points of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency'' in contrast to what he said were `` management failures of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration'' as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. In response to <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s comments, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said: `` If there were n't jobs in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for the people who lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> unemployment rate would practically triple.''

 Men firing submachine guns kidnapped a newspaper executive and former Conservative presidential candidate Sunday and killed his bodyguard. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, 69, the son of former President <PERSON> Laureano </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, was seized as he left church. The abduction came during a wave of leftist guerrilla violence, including the kidnapping of three mayors-elect of small towns, two ambushes that left seven soldiers dead, and guerrilla attacks on two towns and an oil pipeline. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>'s family issued a statement confirming the kidnapping. Some radio stations reported the family said <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> had been wounded, but the statement did not say that. The statement appealed for medical attention for <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> in case he had been wounded. An anonymous person claiming to be one of the kidnappers called the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> radio station Todelar. Then a voice sounding like <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said in Spanish, `` Oh, oh, I'm dying.'' <PERSON> Todelar </PERSON> played a recording of the telephone call. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, on a state visit to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, said in a statement that he ordered all government security forces to search for <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was leaving the church across from the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> on a broad, tree-lined street in the northern part of the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> capital when the kidnappers jumped him. `` I had said goodbye -LRB- to <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> -RRB- and had walked maybe 15 steps when I heard the sound of submachine guns,'' said a former federal senator, <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacio </PERSON>. `` I hit the ground and then I saw four men pushing him into a car,'' <PERSON> Palacio </PERSON> said in an interview with radio station <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>'s only bodyguard was hit by 14 bullets and died in a hospital, police said. There was no claim of responsibility for the abduction of <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> morning daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siglo </ORGANIZATION>. In editorials, <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> has consistently called for `` a country free of guerrillas.'' Leftist guerrillas, right-wing death squads, drug traffickers and other criminals all have been active in kidnapping and killing public officials in the last five years. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> last ran for president on the Conservative party ticket in March 1986 and was defeated by <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, who was the director of a television news program, fled to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> last year after he received kidnapping threats. He is still living in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. An army colonel, a captain and three other soldiers were killed in an apparent guerrilla ambush Sunday near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vicente </LOCATION> in the northern state of <LOCATION> Santander </LOCATION>, the police said in a communique. A lieutenant and a soldier were killed in another ambush in the northern region of Urba, <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> quoted the national police as saying. The mayors-elect were kidnapped Saturday in towns in the northern state of <LOCATION> Bolivar </LOCATION>. They are <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pinillos </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morato </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Viejo </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Barrnaco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loba </LOCATION>, the police said. A leftist guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibililty, police said. The mayors-elect were to have taken office next Wednesday. Two months ago 16 mayors were kidnapped by leftist guerrillas who lectured the mayors to do more for the poor and then let them go. Leftist guerrillas Saturday attacked <LOCATION> Carcasi </LOCATION>, 220 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, and Majugual, 280 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the police said. Guerrillas firing mortars, rocket propelled grenades and automatic assault rifles stormed the police station in <LOCATION> Carcasi </LOCATION>, a statement from the national police said. Two policemen were killed, three were wounded and three were captured, and the police station was reduced to rubble, the statement said. The guerrillas left pamphlets saying they were members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which follows the communist ideology of Cuban president <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. Another guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Maoist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, attacked the police station in <LOCATION> Majugual </LOCATION> and tried unsuccessfully to rob the town's only bank, but the police repulsed the attackers, the statement said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> blew up the country's main oil pipeline again Saturday, another police statement said. The pipeline takes oil from the big <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limon </ORGANIZATION> field on the Venezuelan border in the northeast state of <LOCATION> Arauca </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrolem </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> state oil company, <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION>, operate the field. Several yards of the pipeline were destroyed in the explosion and thousands of gallons of oil were spilled before pumps could be shut down, police said. The 500-mile pipeline goes to <LOCATION> Covenas </LOCATION>, a port on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast It was the 26th time this year that the guerrilla group has attacked the pipeline. The group says it will continue the attacks until foreign oil companies' operations in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are nationalized.

<HEAD>Turkish Cypriots Burn Effigy of U.N. Commander After Fatal
Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 600 Turkish Cypriots rallied Sunday to demand the removal of the Austrian commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force on the divided island after a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> soldier killed a Turkish Cypriot. Protesters burned an effigy of Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> <PERSON> Greindl </PERSON>, the commander of the 2,300-man <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force, and carried banners calling him a murderer. The rally followed a religious service in a mosque in <LOCATION> Famagusta </LOCATION> in memory of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafa </PERSON>. The 57-year-old farmer was killed May 21 in the village of <LOCATION> Pyla </LOCATION>, the only place where the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots still live together. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force said <PERSON> Kafa </PERSON> crossed into the peacekeeping force's zone of operations in the village, claiming he wanted to mend a wall around his farm. They said that when two Austrian soldiers ordered him out of the buffer zone, he drew a pistol and fired at them. The soldiers fired back three pistol shots, killing <PERSON> Kafa </PERSON> instantly. <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, president of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the northern third of the island, charged after the shooting that <PERSON> Greindl </PERSON> ordered Austrian troops to harass <PERSON> Kafa </PERSON> and held him responsible. <PERSON> Greindl </PERSON> denied the allegation. At the end of the rally, <PERSON> Kafa </PERSON>'s three daughters left a black wreath at the Austrian base. The eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island has been divided into Greek and Turkish sectors since 1974, when <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded the island in the wake of an Athens-backed coup. In another development, <PERSON> Kenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Atakol </PERSON>, head of the foreign and defense ministeries of the self-proclaimed Turkish state, accused the peacekeepers of negligence in the shooting death of a Turkish soldier by <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> police on Saturday. Cpl. <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanli </PERSON> was shot after he tried to rape a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> woman, fatally shot a national guardsman and wounded another, officials in the southern Greek sector said. `` The village where the killing took place is in the buffer zone, which should be under the control of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force,'' <PERSON> Atakol </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` They should not have let the armed Greek Cypriots enter this region.'' About 30,000 Turkish soldiers are based in the Turkish sector. The village, <LOCATION> Atheniou </LOCATION>, is near the green line that divides the sectors. <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> police moved into the village southeast of <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> several hours after the guardsmen were shot and fatally shot the soldier when he tried to open fire at them. `` There is negligence on the part of the peacekeeping forces,'' <PERSON> Atakol </PERSON> said. `` Had they informed us before the operation launched, death of the two soldiers would have been avoided.'' He said <PERSON> Sanli </PERSON> might have crossed the line by mistake and tried to hide or ask for food. `` My investigation shows that he was a good-mannered, disciplined and religious person,'' he said.

 Sister <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Neylon </PERSON> swapped her nun's habit for racing gear Sunday and rode Sweet Divine to victory in an unusual charity horse race on the banks of the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boyne </LOCATION>. The Derby it was n't. But as seven sisters swept along the track, the 8,000 spectators in a field at Trim 30 miles from <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> shared excitement matching anything the racegoers at <LOCATION> Epsom </LOCATION> will experience Wednesday during <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most prestigious race. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who organized the race to benefit the convents' chosen charities, had predicted, `` We'll have more nuns than ` The Sound of Music.' Sisters from more than a dozen orders around the country, dressed in their black and white habits and veils, cheered as fervently as any other track fans as their favorites set off on the one-mile course. The racing nuns wore jodhpurs and safety helmets. The horses, all borrowed from local owners, received temporary names with an ecclesiastical flavor. But despite morning prayers, things did n't go perfectly. Sister <PERSON> Olive </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, a convent boarding school cook, had to scratch when her mount Nun Sense died a few minutes before the start. A horse called Mother Superior, to be ridden by Sister <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, did n't show up at the course at all. Sister <PERSON> Annunciata </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuley </PERSON> tumbled off her 5-1 chance Sound of Music 20 yards out of the starting gate. Eighty yards farther on, Sister <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryle </PERSON> from the nearby Good Shepherd Convent was left sitting on the track when <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calling </LOCATION> decided she was too much for him. Two more sisters hit the dirt around the back of the course before the runaway leaders, Sister <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Neylon </PERSON> and Sister <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON>, came back into sight in a neck-and-neck race. Sister <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, a 25-year-old Daughter of Charity from <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, won by a neck over Sweet Divine, the 6-4 favorite, edging out 5O-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Navan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convent </ORGANIZATION> schoolteacher Sister <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> on Devil's Bit. Bookmaker <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgibbon </PERSON> had worked out the odds beforehand by studying the nuns rather than the horses as the ladies arrived at the course. `` It's one race where I am relying entirely on the weight of the jockeys for my judgment,'' he said. `` There are some hefty sisters there who will never stay on board,'' he predicted accurately. Sister <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, a stablehand before she took her vows, gave credit for her win to the prayers of her sisters. `` They were praying all week for me back at the convent,'' she said. Sister <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>'s $ 1,857 first prize goes to her favorite charity, a <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> inner-city youth project. A local school is to benefit from sponsoring the event.

<HEAD>Historian Predicts Probe Will Blame Soviets For World War II
Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A dissident historian predicted Sunday that a joint Soviet-Polish investigation will determine that Soviet, not Nazi German forces, were responsible for a World War II massacre of thousands of Polish soldiers. `` I think the new commission will determine we are to blame,'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedyev </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The Soviet government has for years blamed the killing of more than 4,000 Polish officers in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> occupation forces. But on May 11, the Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> published the first hint that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would accept the version of Western historians. Western scholars say the massacre in the forest near <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION>, 250 miles west of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, was carried out in April 1940 by the <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> state security and police force headed then by <PERSON> Lavrenti </PERSON> <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>, the dreaded henchman of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. `` I have seen German protocols which said that Soviet bullets were found in the exhumed bodies,'' the Literary Gazette quoted Soviet historian <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Latshev </PERSON> as saying at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> symposium of Polish and Soviet historians and filmmakers. <PERSON> Latshev </PERSON> said the `` blank spot'' of the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre could no longer be tolerated. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, under his policy of glasnost, or openness, has encouraged historians to uncover the truth about historical events that were formerly distorted or banned from discussion. The policy has led to sensational admissions of repressions under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Last year, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> signed an agreement on ideological cooperation that stressed the necessity for a more truthful history of Polish-Soviet relations. A Soviet-Polish commission was set up to investigate `` blank spots'' in the two countries' relations. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, in a report Thursday monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said a wreath-laying ceremony was held at a recently renovated monument at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> to `` the Polish officers shot dead by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1941.'' But the report went on to say that version of the massacre was now being reconsidered. Relatives and families of the executed Polish officers will, under new rules, be allowed to visit the memorial, the broadcast quoted <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION> regional official <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> as saying. In 1944, a Soviet commission stated that the officers were killed by Germans, but in the early 1950s, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigatory commission blamed the Soviets. <PERSON> Mevedyev </PERSON> said times have changed and that `` the Poles insist on an objective investigation.'' He predicted the result will be a finding that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> were responsible.

<HEAD>Police Meeting With Racetrack Owners To Dicuss `Fox Hunt' Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drag racing fans pelted police with rocks, beer cans and bottles and nine people were arrested in clashes with police that forced the closing of <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raceway </ORGANIZATION> on its biggest night of the year. Dozens of spectators got cuts, scrapes and police dog bites in brawling that broke out about 8 p.m. Saturday, but only two were treated for minor injuries, authorities said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordfelt </PERSON> said three officers were treated for injuries caused by flying rocks and glass. `` Practically every officer that was there got hit, or kicked, or hit with a projectile, including myself,'' he said. The melee began after two off-duty <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> police officers, working as track security, tried to arrest an unruly spectator and forced him to the ground, <PERSON> Norfelt </PERSON> said. The officers were jumped by other fans and called for assistance. They were joined by six or seven other officers with a dog unit. Violence then erupted in waves between an angry crowd of 500 to 1,000 spectators and about 75 officers, including officers from adjacent <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department and state <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. Most fans apparently were not aware of the fighting until police ordered the track closed for safety reasons about 8:30 p.m. and tried to clear the area, inciting the mob further. The disturbance was the worst ever at the annual `` Fox Hunt'' drag race, typically the raceway's most raucous and popular event. This year's race drew contestants from around the West and 10,000 to 12,000 spectators. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON>, owner of the raceway, said Saturday that police were to blame for responding overzealously to an isolated problem involving only a few fans. `` If they -LRB- police -RRB- had waited 45 more minutes the race would have been over and we would not have had this problem,'' <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> said. Nine people were arrested on charges of public intoxication, disorderly conduct, inciting a riot, assault and resisting arrest, he said. <PERSON> Nordfelt </PERSON> said law enforcement officials met Sunday with <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> and plan further meetings this week to seek ways to eliminate similar problems in the future.

<HEAD>Survey Says 1,267 Western Firms In South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 1,267 companies from 20 Western countries are doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but 188 companies from seven countries have pulled out, according to a survey published Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> survey said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> led the field with 374 companies still operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> led the countries that pulled out with 134 companies. The Brussels-based confederation is the largest trade union organization in the non-communist world, with a membership of 87 million workers in 97 countries. Activists have urged Western companies to withdraw from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to pressure the government to end apartheid. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of traditional and legalized racial segregation, the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. Confederation Secretary General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderveken </PERSON> said in a press release that the report was `` clear evidence of the triumph of corporate greed over morality.'' He derided the claim often made by investors in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that their presence could be an instrument for reform. `` Cheap labor is what brings them to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, not a desire to restore social justice,'' <PERSON> Vanderveken </PERSON> said. The report was particularly critical of companies such as the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tyre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which it said are failing to respect internationally agreed minimum standards on wages and working conditions. It also blamed some British companies for claiming to have pulled out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but having retained substantial interests there. `` The independent black trade union movement of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is adamant that economic sanctions remain the best way of bringing peaceful change to their country,'' <PERSON> Vanderveken </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> ICFTU </ORGANIZATION> remains committed to that policy.'' Following <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, countries with the biggest number of companies still in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with 333; the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 164; <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, 103; <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 90; <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, 54; the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, 29; <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, 28; <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, 20; <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, 19; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 18; <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, 10 each; <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, seven; <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, two each; and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> with one each. Among the countries pulling out, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was No. 2 with 26 companies, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 20; the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, four; <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, two; and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> with one each. The labor organization said several of the 333 German companies in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were involved in the armaments industry. Among those listed were BMW and <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, whose <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arican </LOCATION> subsidiaries were making armored cars, and a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> AEG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telefunken </ORGANIZATION>, the electronics company, which makes switch gears for armored cars. Among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>, Twentieth Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> and Pan American. French firms included the tourist company <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediterranee </ORGANIZATION> and the pharmaceutical and chemical company <ORGANIZATION> Rhone-Poulenc </ORGANIZATION>.

 The Army once again postponed the test burn of a Pershing II rocket motor Sunday and will have to conduct the test by Tuesday or face a further 30-day delay, officials said. The test burn is an important step in imposing terms of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which calls for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to eliminate medium-range missiles. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Pueblo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activity </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials were told they have until 5 p.m. Tuesday to finish the test or it will have to be postponed under the INF treaty. `` After the treaty enters into force, all assets of both countries covered by the treaty would be frozen for 30 days,'' she said. `` The test must then be treated as an elimination and done according to provisions of the treaty.'' The INF treaty was ratified Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Friday and by the Soviet Presidium on Saturday. The treaty is expected to be formalized by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during the current <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit and will be in force Wednesday. Adverse weather conditions have forced repeated postponements since the originally scheduled test date of May 20. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said an absence of wind led to Sunday's postponement. On Saturday, instability in the upper winds and a threat of thunderstorms forced officials to call off the test. The Army is aiming for a test burn at about 6:30 a.m. Monday, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. If the test is n't completed by Tuesday, a Soviet delegation probably would be allowed to monitor the test under the INF treaty, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The test burn is needed to determine the suitability of the Pueblo site for destroying the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 420 Pershing missiles to comply with the INF treaty.

 Foreign ministers and officials of more than 100 nations Sunday adopted a resolution calling for the elimination of nuclear arms, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government news agency reported. The resolution, approved during the first day of a special meeting on disarmament in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> capital, praised the superpower agreement to abolish intermediate-range nuclear weapons as a first step toward nuclear disarmament. Foreign ministers of the Third World and non-aligned nations also sent a message to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who are meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, calling for a 50-percent reduction in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet nuclear arsenals by the end of the year. `` In welcoming the progress made in bilateral -LRB- nuclear arms -RRB- negotiations, we reiterate the necessity of encouraging multilateral talks, especially in the framework of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' the message said. The message was carried by the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> news agency in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Introduced by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the resolution called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to adopt a `` program by stages for the total elimination of nuclear arms. Also, it is imperative that other states that possess nuclear arms be incorporated in this process,'' the news agency reported. The resolution said: `` We are firmly convinced that the treaty between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the elimination of their short - and medium-range nuclear missiles and land bases must mark the beginning of the process that must be consolidated. President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> sent a message to the ministerial conference saying that although the current climate favors a political dialogue, the threat of world war continues. In his message, read to the meeting by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamuyarira </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> praised the U.S.-Soviet agreement signed last December in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the first superpower arms treaty in 16 years.

 A team from <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> won a battle of wits Sunday with students from 15 other schools to win the national College Bowl championship. The questions ranged from science and politics to entertainment trivia, and contestants were quick to distinguish their sport from the popular board game Trivial Pursuit. `` Trivial Pursuit is about trivia, but College Bowl is about things you should have learned in college,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkin </PERSON>, a 25-year-old law school graduate on the team of runnerup <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` One might think of College Bowl players as eggheads, but eggheads are the worst college bowl players,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, who created the television game show 35 years ago and attended this weekend's contest. `` It -LRB- College Bowl -RRB- takes someone who is able to participate quickly in anything in life _ someone who's alive to what's going on in the world.'' One question in the final between <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> State and <LOCATION> Emory </LOCATION> was: `` On Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, he works from 9 to 5; on Wednesdays, from 9 to 1; and on Fridays until early afternoon. During working hours, he often takes two or three hours to read and answer his fan mail.'' <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Barkin </PERSON> pushed his buzzer and yelled, `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' before the moderator finished reading the question. That was correct, but it was n't good enough to match the points <ORGANIZATION> N.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> team tallied during the two-day event at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> campus of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrus </PERSON>, a 24-year-old veterinary student at <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> State who trains four hours a week with his College Bowl team, said he's good at the game because `` I remember a lot of facts and I'm able to recall them quickly.'' No prizes were awarded, but <PERSON> Petrus </PERSON> said the reward of beating four-person teams from colleges such as <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> `` is knowing that you've been able to think faster and out-think the others _ it's an ego thing.''

 Former President <PERSON> Siaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who led this West African nation for 17 years, died Sunday at his home after a brief illness. He was 82. `` The government of <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION> and all Peoples <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> regret to announce the death of His Excellency <PERSON> Siaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>,'' the government said in a statement.

He also had suffered partial paralysis on his left side, his doctors said. There was no immediate word on funeral plans. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was one of the few African leaders ever to relinquish power voluntarily. He became prime minister of <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION> in 1968 after a military coup and assumed the presidency on April 21, 1971, two days after <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON> <PERSON> Leone </PERSON> became a republic. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was president until November 1985, when he transferred power to his handpicked successor, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Momoh </PERSON>, the armed forces commander. On a continent where leaders normally hold power for life, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was only the fourth black African head of state to retire from office. President <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Senghor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, who led his West African nation to independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1960, resigned in 1981. <PERSON> Amadou </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahidjo </PERSON> resigned as president of <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION> in 1982 after governing for the first 22 years of independence. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyerere </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> retired as president in 1985, just days ahead of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, after 24 years in office, but held onto the country's most powerful political position, chairmanship of the governing party. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, described in `` Who's Who in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' as `` a bluff, friendly, approachable, pragmatic socialist'' was born Aug. 24, 1905. He had made a name for himself and secured a following as a trade unionist when the British still ruled <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>. As British rule came to an end, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> refused to join a three-party coalition that was to assume power. Instead, he formed the opposition <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was on the sidelines on April 27, 1961, when <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON> <PERSON> Leone </PERSON> became independent and Sir <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Margai </PERSON> became the country's first prime minister <PERSON> Margai </PERSON> died a day after the third anniversary of <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>'s independence and was succeeded as prime minister and head of the governing party by Sir <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Margai </PERSON>, no relation <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' party won the March 1967 general elections, but shortly after <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was sworn in as prime minister, he and other officials were arrested by the chief of the army. After a month of infighting among the military that saw power change hands at least three times, a military-led <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> took control and returned the leadership of the country to <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' civilian government. He survived two coup attempts, in September 1970 and March 1972. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was among the first voices in what has become a chorus of protests in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> over the lending policies of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, which normally demands that would-be borrowers cut subsidies, devalue their currency and take other unpopular measures. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> called such moves `` political suicide.'' <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON> <PERSON> Leone </PERSON> was in an economic crisis at the time of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' retirement There were chronic shortages of fuel, food and foreign exchange and the coastal nation of 5 million people had a reputation as a paradise for smugglers. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' relations with President <PERSON> Momoh </PERSON>, his former protege, became strained after an unsuccessful coup plot early in 1987. The former vice president and 17 others were convicted of treason in the abortive attempt. No charges were brought against <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, but several of those convicted were his close associates. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> subsequently refused <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> a visa. The coup plotters were sentenced to death. Their appeal is now before the high court.

 With two principal dancers from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s Kirov Ballet in starring roles and the American Ballet Theater company in top form, a full-length performance of `` La Bayadere'' made for an electric evening <PERSON> Altynai </PERSON> <PERSON> Assylmuratova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Farukh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruzimatov </PERSON> are the first Soviet dancers to guest with American Ballet Theater. `` La Bayadere'' was first performed in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in 1877. It was staged and choreographed, after <PERSON> Marius </PERSON> <PERSON> Petipa </PERSON>, for American Ballet Theater by <PERSON> Natalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Makarova </PERSON> in 1980. Miss <PERSON> Makarova </PERSON>, who was a <LOCATION> Kirov </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> dancer before she defected to the West, at that time danced the part of <LOCATION> Nikiya </LOCATION>, the temple dancer or bayadere. On Saturday night, <PERSON> Ruzimatov </PERSON> danced the role of the warrior Solor, who falls in love with the bayadere, performed by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Assylmuratova </PERSON>. Then the <PERSON> Radjah </PERSON> introduces Solor to his daughter to be his bride and Solor falls for her beauty. When <PERSON> Ruzimatov </PERSON> entered the stage, he was a coiled spring _ a slim, lithe man about to burst with energy. An entrance of such contained excitement has seldom been seen since <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON> was young. <PERSON> Ruzimatov </PERSON> lived up to that promise with his turns in air, the elevation of his jumps and the beauty of his technique. Miss <PERSON> Assylmuratova </PERSON> has splendid technique also, and her duet and solo dancing dazzled. However, she seemed tense instead of conveying freedom as she flew across the stage. One expects her to relax more for her second performance. Also, she did n't convey the acting part of her role as <PERSON> Ruzimatov </PERSON> did his. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> danced the Radjah's daughter. She held her own in what must have seemed daunting company. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> was very effective as the High Brahmin who also loves the bayadere and whose mime gestures help move the plot. <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Renvall </PERSON> was the third act's bronze idol and did his solo in a dignified way instead of making it look silly. The second act, in the Kingdom of the Shades, is all of `` La Bayadere'' usually seen in this country. Its soothing beauty rests on the corps de ballet's being able to move in unison and to hold long, difficult balances. On Saturday night, Ballet Theater's corps de ballet was exquisite.

<TEXT>
 An investor group considering a takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cashways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has stepped up pressure on the building materials retailer by asking for a special shareholders meeting to rescind a takeover defense provision. The group also criticized a compensation plan for <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION>' 24 top officers if they lost their jobs because of a change in the company's ownership. The plan, which had not previously been disclosed, was ratified earlier this month by <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION>' board of directors, <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON> said Friday. The investor group is led by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> takeover specialist <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Sutherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber-Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately owned competitor of <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> that also is based in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> has about 200 stores in 25 states. The group owns 9.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION>' stock, or 3.34 million shares, and has said that it might attempt a takeover of the company. The group disclosed its intentions May 19 when it said that it controlled 7.6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION>' stock. It has spent about $ 70 million since then to increase its holding in the company. The investor group requested the special shareholders meeting in a letter sent to <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> late Friday. The letter asked that the meeting be held within 90 days. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION>, has said that a takeover by the Edelman-Sutherland group would not be in the best interest of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> adopted its takeover defense May 12, the same day it ratified the executive compensation plan. The provision essentially increases the cost of a takeover. Financial analysts have said the takeover could cost as much as $ 1 billion. The investor group has asked that three amendments to <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION>' bylaws be submitted to a vote by shareholders In addition to the amendment rescinding the takeover defense provision, another amendment would allow shareholders to vote on any takeover offer made to the company that had the approval from holders of at least 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION>' stock. The third amendment would require any further takeover defenses to be approved by holders of at least 50 percent of the shares.

<HEAD>Residents of Illinois Town Endure Stench to Stock Nation's
Cupboards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOOPESTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The smell of success stinks, say some residents of this east-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> town whose canneries supply food that stocks the nation's cupboards. Each spring residents await the return of noxious fumes that waft off water used to process beans and corn at two local canneries that support the town's economy. `` I just tell people it only hurts your nose, it does n't hurt your lungs,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hoopeston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> official Rose Buck. `` That's the smell of success.'' Millions of gallons of the contaminated water are sprayed irrigation-style onto nearby fields until winter weather arrives. Warm temperatures release the vapors and winds carry them around and into the town of 6,400 residents. While canning company officials say special equipment has helped, the odor leaves many breathless. `` There is nothing more offensive than the bean water,'' said <LOCATION> Hoopeston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Councilman <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, who farms near the ponds sitting along <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Rts. 1 and 9. `` You do n't get used to it. You just hope you're not in that field too long.'' But the putrid smell _ best described as rotting vegetables _ represents money in the bank for the townspeople. Two century-old <LOCATION> Hoopeston </LOCATION> canneries _ owned by <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury-Joan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stokely </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ employ hundreds of local residents and pump millions of dollars into the area's economy. Thousands more migrant seasonal workers are hired each year to help with the fall harvest. `` If we do n't have that smell, we would be in trouble,'' <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> said, adding that most Americans probably do n't realize what <PERSON> Hoopeston </PERSON> endures to keep canned goods in the nation's grocery stores. `` They do n't even know where a can of beans comes from. They do n't know where milk comes from, or how much work is done to keep the beans clean,'' he said. Nine types of beans come into the Pillsbury-Joan of Arc plant dry and must be washed and then soaked and softened in water. Most of the water is then discarded. The rehydrated beans, including kidney, garbanzo and black-eyed peas, are sold to consumers nationwide under the Joan of Arc and other labels, and used in chili sold by the <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s hamburger chain. Plant Manager <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kortkamp </PERSON> of Pillsbury-Joan of Arc says the company invested in a $ 1 million, state-of-the-art water reclamation facility three years ago that eliminated much of the odor. The system strains the larger bean parts out, then pumps the water into tanks where microscopic organisms eat much of the remaining bean matter. `` I'm talking about a relative smell,'' <PERSON> Kortkamp </PERSON> said. `` On a scale of one to 10 we have improved it to an eight or nine.'' But some odor remains, <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> said. `` After they have processed it two or three times, then it gets into that big lagoon out there. Then they spray it into the air and it gets a little rank,'' he said. In the fall, fumes from water used to process sweet corn contribute to the odor problem. Pungent corn water then is sprayed onto fields north of town. <PERSON> Stokely </PERSON> sells the corn and a variety of other canned goods under its label. While the scent might annoy some vistors, many long-time residents say it's all in the nose. `` That does n't stink,'' a <LOCATION> Hoopeston </LOCATION> policeman said when asked about the smell. `` I've lived here all my life and I'm used to it.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Rawlings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has announced that it is getting out of the football helmet business, citing increased liability and `` skyrocketing'' insurance costs. The company will continue to manufacture football equipment from the neck down and will also continue to make non-competitive replica helmets, <PERSON> Rawlings </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Rawlings </PERSON>' departure from the helmet business leaves only two major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers _ <ORGANIZATION> Riddell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and A.H.I.
