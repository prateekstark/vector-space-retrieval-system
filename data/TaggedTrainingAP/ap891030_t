 A series of 21 photos of clouds by photographer <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stieglitz </PERSON> brought $ 396,000 at auction Monday and a watch sold for $ 539,000, both setting records, auction houses said. The watch sold to a private collector for the highest price ever paid for a watch at auction in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. The photo sale was a record price for a single lot of photography, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house said. The watch, with a face measuring 1.4 inches, was made by Swiss craftsmen and took three years to complete. It was designed and commissioned in 1927 by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, who worked for <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s before opening his own business and who also designed watches for <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION> `` It was the most complicated watch of its size ever to be made,'' said <PERSON> Daryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnipper </PERSON>, a watch expert for <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to a standard dial that tells time, the watch face has four smaller dials. One gives the month, one gives the day of the week, one registers the date and has a second hand, and another gives the phases of the moon. The previous record for a watch sold at auction was set earlier this year when a wristwatch went for $ 275,000. <PERSON> Stieglitz </PERSON>' `` Equivalents _ Three Series of Seven Each'' was bought by an anonymous collector, said <PERSON> Bethe </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, a publicist for <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s. The series consists of 21 different black-and-white photos of clouds, each measuring 3 -LCB- by 4 -LCB- inches, dating from the 1920s. <PERSON> Stieglitz </PERSON> signed the title page of the series, dedicating it to <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheim </PERSON>, a patron and friend. The series was sold by the <PERSON> Wertheim </PERSON> family, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said.

 A terrorist and a policeman were killed by a grenade that burst as the terrorist prepared to toss it at a passing police patrol Monday night, police said. They said an accomplice and a second police officer were wounded in the explosion in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minuto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dios </LOCATION>, a northwestern suburb of this capital city of 6 million people. Two other bombs exploded late Monday in south and central <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, but no casualties were reported, authorities said. One bomb destroyed part of a bank front and neighboring buildings and the other caused minor damage at the social security building. The latest incidents, following violence late Sunday that wounded two journalists, apparently came in response to a decision by the government of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to refuse to negotiate with drug traffickers. The government declared war against the drug lords and their hired killers on Aug. 19 after leading presidential candidate Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> was assassinated. Since then, at least 237 bombings and bombing attempts have taken place throughout <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, mostly in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cartegena </LOCATION>, resulting in the deaths of 33 people. Earlier Monday, eight people were killed and 30 injured when a bus sped off the side of a ravine near <LOCATION> Bordo </LOCATION>, 340 miles south of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, police said. The bus was traveling north from Ipiales near the border with <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. Police said the bus apparently was traveling too fast.

 <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> never learned how to salute or put on a military uniform properly, because the only time he spent in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was after he was arrested as a deserter and threatened with court-martial. <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, who has sued the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5 million, says the whole mess began when someone `` stole his identity,'' by taking his name and Social Security number and enlisting. The Army admits the arrest was in error, but claims it was <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>'s responsibility to clear up the confusion before it got that far. <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> says he notified a recruiter, whose name he ca n't remember, several years before the imposter deserted. Now <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, is awaiting a judge's ruling in the case after a non-jury trial earlier this month in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court here. The judge has not indicated when he will rule. After <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>'s arrest in June 1985, he spent two days in the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail and nine hours at <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> before his wife, with the assistance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON>'s office, got him released. <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said he was frightened when an officer said he was to be sent to a military prison at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, for court-martial. `` All this was new to me,'' said <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, who said when he was told to put on an Army uniform, he did n't know he was supposed to tuck his pants into his boots. `` And just because I did n't put it on right, they made me do push-ups.'' Failing to salute a lieutenant brought more push-ups, he said. The calisthenics, along with sleeping on a concrete floor at the jail for two nights, aggravated a back condition, he said. Besides physical suffering, <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> claims his reputation was damaged and he suffered emotional distress _ he spent a month in a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> psychiatric hospital this year _ and damage to his credit rating. He has had problems with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and demands for payment of the impostor's debts to the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and others, he said. He claims he was hospitalized in February because he was paranoid and cautious of others. `` I used to even look at the telephone man and think he was spying on me,'' he said. A man calling himself <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> and using <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>'s Social Security number joined the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, in 1975. He was sent to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where he eventually deserted, <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. The non-military <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> found out about the impostor in 1981 when the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said he had not been paying taxes on military income. `` It still puzzles me right now,'' <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. `` I wonder why, and of all people, why me. I have enough problems. I do n't need any more problems. People do give the wrong Social Security number occasionally, either intentionally or by accidentally scrambling the numbers, said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Higdon </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s district manager for <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` The best thing someone can do is check their Social Security record periodically'' and make sure the annual earnings match the figures on the income tax return for each year, <PERSON> Higdon </PERSON> said. The Army does n't deny the mix-up caused <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> trouble. `` There's no question that he had a rough time, spending 48 hours in jail and another day down at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, the assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney who is handling the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s case. But <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said the responsibility was <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>'s. `` He's the one who had the potential to be harmed by the mistaken records, so I think he had an obligation to follow up and make sure action was taken,'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said.

 The cab drivers will still be surly. The Statue of Liberty will still light the harbor. The <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> will still be up, the Battery down, and the folks will still ride in a hole in the ground. But <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is on the edge of a momentous change _ one that will alter the way the nation's largest city is governed. In a referendum that has drawn little attention in the midst of a tumultuous mayoral campaign, city voters this Nov. 7 will have an opportunity to approve or reject a charter that would strengthen the mayor and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> while wiping out an entire governing body, the Board of Estimate. The board is arguably the most powerful segment of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s government, with final say over the budget. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that it is unconstitutional, so the city must change. `` I think one of the things we're doing is making <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> like normal governments in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> A.O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the commission that came up with the new, 393-page city charter. That means forming a bigger <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, changing the mayor's duties and responsibilities and creating new ways to award contracts, approve the budget and myriad other procedures Polls indicate the new charter will pass easily, despite considerable if disjointed opposition. The Board of Estimate dates back to 1901. It reflected a new <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: In 1898, <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the city of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and what is now <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> joined <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> to become one consolidated city. Each of those five boroughs has a president, and those presidents sit on the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION>, along with the three officials elected citywide: the mayor, comptroller and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> president. For 89 years, the board has been approving contracts, deciding most land-use questions and approving the annual budget. The citywide officials have two votes each, while each borough president has one. So <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, with 350,000 residents, has the same voice as <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, with 2.2 million. That, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last March, violated the principle of one-person, one-vote. The new plan is updated to suit a changing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where minorities account for more than half the population but only 25 percent of the council is black or Hispanic. `` We paid a lot of attention to making sure that minorities had fair representation,'' <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would be expanded from 35 to 51 members under the new plan, and the smaller districts are expected to produce more minority members, perhaps as many as 20, or 40 percent of the council. With the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> dissolved, the council will become a true legislature, with final say on the budget and most land use and zoning questions. The mayor will continue running executive agencies, appointing commissioners, proposing the city budget and estimating revenues _ a crucial element in spending debates. `` What the city's doing is moving from a unique, screwball form of government to one that looks a lot more like what other cities do _ that's a strong mayor, strong council form of government,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Russianoff </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Supporters say the larger council and new requirements for public disclosure and a new independent budget office will check the mayor's power. But without the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION>, critics contend, the mayor will be too powerful _ `` We will have an imperial mayor,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON>, borough president of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON> and his fellow borough presidents stand to lose the most power under the plan, and are among its most outspoken opponents. The other opponents come from a variety of sources that do n't necessarily have much else in common. `` There's the far left and the far right and we're sort of the center,'' <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said. `` These people are utterly strange bedfellows. They could n't possibly come up with a solution.'' Most city residents seem only vaguely aware of the proposed changes, which are n't, after all, going to revolutionize life in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The average resident, <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said, `` is going to find government more responsive, and that will be a plus. But will it pave the streets with gold? No.''

 Investigators found a trail leading to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> as the likely source of the bomb that blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing 270 people, prosecutor's spokesman <PERSON> Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON> said Monday Authorities said a Libyan man may have played a role in the Dec. 21 bombing. Schroers, of the prosecutor's office, said a suitcase coming from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> aboard an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malta </ORGANIZATION> flight was the `` presumed'' container for the bomb. The suitcase was put aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malta </ORGANIZATION> flight on the tiny <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island nation before being transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight at its originating point in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, officials reported. Other evidence recently uncovered by investigators in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> adds to suspicion that the bombing was carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Tuesday editions. Sixteen members of the Palestinian group were arrested in raids in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in October 1988 and a bomb similar to the one believed to have destroyed the plane was seized in that investigation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>, a Palestinian now being held on terrorism charges in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, has told investigators he retrieved one bomb overlooked in the raids, and passed it to another person. Officials declined to identify to whom <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> said he passed the bomb. But they also said <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> was spotted in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> in October 1988 in the company of <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalkamoni </PERSON>, a suspected leader of the Palestinian group who was arrested in the West German raids later that month. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> first disclosed the evidence of a possible Maltese connection. It said the bomb was placed in a suitcase containing clothing made and purchased in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Citing British sources, the newspaper said the baggage list showed one suitcase was transferred to Flight 103 from <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malta </ORGANIZATION> Flight KM180, which originated in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> on the morning of Dec. 21. No passenger accompanied the bag on the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight, it said. All 259 people on the jumbo jet and 11 residents of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, died as a result of the Dec. 21 bombing. In a statement sent by fascimile machine to news media, <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON> said West German investigators earlier informed <LOCATION> Scottish </LOCATION> investigators about suspicions regarding <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. `` The suspicions were made more concrete, when the Scottish officials informed the Germans that clothing made in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> was in the presumed bomb suitcase,'' the statement said. It said passengers on the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malta </ORGANIZATION> flight were not under suspicion. The statement denied British news media reports of friction between West German and British investigators. <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON> said earlier in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that West German investigators `` are in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, but the Scottish officials are taking the lead.'' `` It was possibly a man of Libyan extraction, but we ca n't say more than that,'' <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON> said of the person who investigators believe bought the clothes that were in the suitcase. `` The investigation into this lead has not been completed.'' Previous reports said the bomb was placed on board in luggage checked in at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. West German investigators repeatedly denied any evidence existed to substantiate those claims. Pan Am Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, taking on passengers and luggage flown in from other areas on international `` feeder flights.'' Passengers and bags were transferred to the doomed <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fundermann </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal criminal investigations office in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, said investigators have a `` hot trail'' leading to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. `` There are clues that a suitcase from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> may have played a part,'' said <PERSON> Fundermann </PERSON>. `` There are also clues that someone from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> _ or at least someone with a Libyan accent _ may have bought the items.'' The Flight 103 bomb was packed into a <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> radiocassette player, investigators have said. <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, about 180 miles north of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, enjoys good relations with the government of radical leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, the chief investigator and head of the judiciary both refused Monday to disclose any details of the hunt for the bomber. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Esson </PERSON>, chief constable of <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> who is leading the international investigation, issued a statement saying investigators are pursuing a number of `` encouraging lines of inquiry'' in a number of countries. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s Lord Advocate and its top judicial officer, said in a separate statement that `` the investigation continues to make encouraging progress.'' He said he feared that premature disclosure of the progress of the investigation `` could cause grave prejudice to the investigation itself.'' <PERSON> Esson </PERSON> said: `` Since the outset of this inquiry there has been a close liaison between the Scottish police, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> BKA </ORGANIZATION>. Information exchanged at regular meetings between these three agencies has contributed greatly to the ongoing and very active criminal investigation.''

 Stone-throwing mobs, blackened hulls of burned shops and the smell of gunpowder and smoldering ashes evoke dreaded memories of the bloodiest chapter in modern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s history. Town after town in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is erupting in religious rioting. Even the former princely state of <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> has become a victim of the frenzy and hatred it escaped during the birth of Hindu <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moslem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in the 1947 partition when an estimated 1 million people were killed. Hindu-Moslem riots and violence have claimed about 200 lives in the past six weeks. Against that backdrop, with Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government and the opposition blaming each other for the renewed violence, next month's parliamentary elections could be the most divisive and violent in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 42 years of independence. `` The situation is so bad there might be a bloodbath before the elections. I feel it is the worst since independence,'' said <PERSON> Indrajit </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, deputy secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>. Nationwide, the communal caldron is on high boil. More than 500 people have died this year in sectarian violence in the Hindu heartland states _ <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Madhya </PERSON> <PERSON> Pradesh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maharashtra </LOCATION> _ more than double the number killed in the three previous years. `` Even for those of us who lived through the partition, there is no reason for this poison pill,'' said <PERSON> Shabir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, a 63-year-old Moslem shopkeeper in <LOCATION> Jaipur </LOCATION>, the picturesque `` Pink City'' of <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION>. `` People now have blood on their hands, hatred in their eyes, revenge in their hearts, and their souls are ruled by rumors,'' he said. As the election draws closer, one right-wing opposition party is offering a different vision and fanning the communal flames. The <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and called <ORGANIZATION> BJP </ORGANIZATION>, has revived the idea of a Hindu <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, attacking the secular base on which modern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was created. It sees a groundswell of public support in this Hindu-dominated country _ particularly in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> which has almost half the 542 seats at stake in the voting on Nov. 22, 24 and 26. The <ORGANIZATION> BJP </ORGANIZATION> contends Hindus have been discriminated against because of secularist policies dating back to <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first prime minister and the current prime minister's grandfather, while minorities and particularly the Moslems have been pampered The <ORGANIZATION> BJP </ORGANIZATION> is not a major party but the main centrist opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has agreed to share seats with it in the north, largely because it sees no other way to defeat <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` The obsession with vote banks seems to have driven out all rational thought,'' the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said in an editorial. `` It's heads I win, tails you lose because brave words notwithstanding, the peril of communal animosity is still not taken seriously. It is all a game in which there is no prize beyond votes,'' the editorial said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s religious and ethnic mosaic has been inhospitable to a Hindu party until now. Although Hindus comprise more than 80 percent of the population, they have long been divided along caste and class lines. Except in times of danger, they rarely vote as a bloc. Moslems, on the other hand, make up just 11 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people but often wield pivotal electoral influence Yet they number more than 100 million, giving <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> the world's biggest Moslem population after <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. Moslems traditionally have tended to vote as a bloc, making up more than 20 percent of the electorate in about 100 constituencies. But now the quest is for a new vote bloc, a consolidated Hindu vote cutting across caste lines. `` Never before have Hindus voted en bloc, and hence all political parties have ignored them, vitally affecting their interests,'' said <PERSON> Vishnu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hari </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalmia </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Vishwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parishad </ORGANIZATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, a fundamentalist organization and a staunch <ORGANIZATION> BJP </ORGANIZATION> ally. `` The fundamental issue today is whether minorities are going to enjoy the status of a privileged class or are treated on par with their Hindu counterparts,'' <PERSON> Dalmia </PERSON> said. `` Thanks to the appeasement politics of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> toward minorities for the last four decades today a Hindu in his own country is a second-class citizen.'' There are other undercurrents, but the primary reason for the sharpened hostility among Hindus and Moslems is the revival of a dispute over <LOCATION> Babri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Masjid </LOCATION>, a mosque in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> that is believed built on the site of a demolished Hindu temple. The disputed site was locked in 1949. Neither Hindus nor Moslems could pray there until 1986 when a judge ordered the building unlocked for worship. The issue became a rallying cry for militant Hindu organizations that revived the call for building a temple and set Nov. 9 for the foundation-laying ceremony.

 About 25,000 people attended a memorial service Monday night for 22 workers who died in a series of explosions at a plastics plant last week, and three more bodies were recovered from the rubble. Among those attending the 45-minute service at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> were 259 relatives of those who died in the <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant disaster last Monday. `` No one can really explain why happenings such as this occur,'' said S.R. `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman emeritus of Bank One of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> here. `` I surely do n't know, but I do know this: a tragedy of this magnitude brings us all closer together and demonstrates the love, the care and the concern we have for one another.'' Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cluck </PERSON>, chaplain of the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, asked <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> employees to honor those who died by having the strength to return to work and live their lives `` the way they would want you to live.'' The recovery of three bodies brought the confirmed death toll to 17. The remains of five workers remain missing. The explosions injured 124 people. Despite thunderstorms and heavy rain, work crews continued moving tons of steel and concrete in hopes of recovering the last of the victims. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, whose district includes this city of 119,300, toured the plant and met with authorities. `` You really have to be here to see how absolutely devastating that blast was,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` Fully a quarter of the plant has been eliminated. There is still a safety factor at the plant site. There are still fires burning. It is an awesome sight to see.'' Much of the search has concentrated on the plant's control and finishing rooms, where debris is stacked as high as 40 feet, officials said. The polyethylene plant maufactured almost 20 percent of the nation's production of plastic pellets used to make milk jugs and grocery bags. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> officials believe flammable hydrocarbon vapor from ethylene and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking chemical reactor, triggering the explosion. But company officials have said they do n't know how the gases were ignited and wo n't concentrate on finding a cause until all the missing victims have been found.

 Fires broke out on the first night of a three-night Halloween-time curfew Sunday as police, firefighters and citizen volunteers tried to keep `` Devil's Night'' arson under control. Asked how many fires had broken out, authorities said the mayor's office would compile figures and release them on Monday. No injuries were reported in any of the fires. Figures were also not available on the number of people arrested under the curfew, said Police Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavens </PERSON>. An abandoned home was set on fire twice within 90 minutes, radio station WWJ-AM reported. The second time, the blaze spread to an occupied home. Several fires were reported in garages on the city's lower east side, according to the station. Firefighters on the east side were so busy that firefighters were called in from the west side. Police found several cases of dynamite, blasting caps and radio control devices in the garage of a vacant home on the northeast side Sunday night, but were n't sure whether it was connected with Devil's Night, <PERSON> Leavens </PERSON> said. The police bomb squad took the explosives away for disposal. Fires are set during Devil's Night, which traditionally lasts three nights, in a destructive celebration of Halloween. The practice drew national attention in 1984, when 810 fires were set in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Since then, the number of fires has decreased each year. Last year, there were 229 fires reported, for an average of 76 per night. About 65 fires are reported on a normal night in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, fire officials have said. The curfew, which allows police to detain anyone under 18, went into effect at 6 p.m. and was to be in effect until 6 a.m. Monday In addition to police and firefighters, officials have said they expected 30,000 volunteers would help patrol streets. The Fire Department set up a special number for car phone callers.

<HEAD>Veterans' Administration to Reconsider Agent Orange Issue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An advisory committee to the Department of Veterans Affairs this week may open the door a crack to disability benefits for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Responding to a federal court decision in May, the 15-member Veterans' <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hazards </ORGANIZATION> will look again at scientific papers and studies on the herbicide used to clear dense foliage that hid the enemy. This time, however, the committee will use standards considered less strict than those used for determining other service-connected disabilities. No one is predicting the outcome. But there is agreement that <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> wants to resolve the issue quickly and in favor of veterans. `` I do n't think he's going to fool around very long,'' <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` He's so far exhibited a degree of willingness _ if not impatience _ to go along rather rapidly with this.'' Once the committee does its work <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> is `` kind of on his own as to how he wants to fly on this,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> will make a final determination on the committee's recommendations within two weeks of receiving results of the meeting According to one congressional source, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s actions mean `` he's almost promised people'' that he will take some positive action for veterans. Veterans blame exposure to Agent Orange for cancers, skin diseases and genetic damage leading to miscarriages or birth defects. The committee will spend its first two days reviewing about 20 or 30 studies on the connection between exposure and non-Hodgkins lymphoma, one of the most frequently cited cancers, then study other diseases at later meetings. On Friday, it will issue recommendations on non-Hodgkins lymphoma and Agent Orange. The four-year-old advisory committee and government scientists have thus far rejected a link between Agent Orange exposure and health problems other than a skin condition known as chloracne. The American Legion, the prime veterans' group in this dispute, contends the committee has a longstanding bias against veterans. Not so, says <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON>, the disabled veteran and scientific layman in charge of the panel. `` Their greatest interest is their own integrity as scientists,'' he said. The government says the main problem with studies up to now is that there has been no way to verify exposure to dioxin. The American Legion and others say the government has detailed records on spraying activities that can be combined with equally detailed records on troop movements. Agent Orange, an orange-brown liquid that was shipped in orange-striped barrels, was sprayed in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> from January 1965 to April 1970. More than 230,000 veterans have registered with <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> claiming to have been exposed. More than 36,000 veterans have filed for disability benefits claiming Agent Orange exposure caused their problems, and two have been granted compensation _ for chloracne. Agent Orange is suspect because it contains `` phenoxy'' herbicides associated with certain cancers as well as dioxin, which has been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Dioxin's links to human health problems are disputed, although its links to human birth defects are more firmly established. A ruling in May by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Thelton </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> created a way out of the impasse over Agent Orange. A new administration and the elevation of the Veterans' Administration to cabinet status added another ingredient <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> ruled May 2 that the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> imposed an `` impermissibly demanding test'' for linking Agent Orange with health problems. Although the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has relied on a `` cause and effect'' relationship in determining service-connected disabilities, the committee was to use a different standard: `` a significant statistical association.'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> told Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on May 8 that he had decided against an appeal. New regulations for reviewing studies using the new standard, effective Wednesday, say a link will be deemed to exist if the studies associating Agent Orange with health problems outweigh the evidence that there is no association. The regulations say the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> secretary can give the `` benefit of the doubt to the conclusion that the association exists.'' In early October, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> named Adm. <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as a special adviser with a specific emphasis on Agent Orange. <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> ordered spraying of Agent Orange during <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and he lost a son who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to a cancer linked with that spraying. <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> is known as a veterans' advocate on this issue.

 The nation's first black governor was a freed slave and a savvy politician who served a caretaker period of four weeks in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> after the Civil War, historians say. Interest in P.B.S. <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s governor from December 1872 to January 1873, has revived with the possible election in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> this year of a black governor, Democrat <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s lieutenant governor and a grandson of freed slaves, is running against Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a former attorney general who lost the state's 1981 election for governor. If <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> wins, he would be the first elected black governor of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON> was not elected to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Pinckney </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON> was `` the most intelligent, resourceful and dynamic of the black legislators during Reconstruction,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carleton </PERSON>, a history professor at <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. `` He was a very able leader, a very persuasive speaker.'' The son of a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> slave owner and a black slave, <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON> was freed by his father before the Civil War and was a captain in the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. After the war, <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON> settled in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and joined the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> blacks </ORGANIZATION> and radical whites. He was elected to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1868 and was chosen as the chamber's president pro tempore When Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, who also was black, died in November 1871, <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON> moved by constitutional succession to the state's No 2 office under <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s carpetbag governor, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Warmoth </PERSON>. At the time, <PERSON> Warmoth </PERSON> was becoming a political maverick. A Republican, he was attempting to shift his power base to the Democrats, apparently sensing a revival of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s pre-war white power structure. In the 1872 election, <PERSON> Warmoth </PERSON> supported President <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s opponent, <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Greeley </PERSON> But <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> won, and the next month the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> legislature brought impeachment proceedings against <PERSON> Warmoth </PERSON>. During the trial, <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON> became acting governor. The impeachment case was still under way in January when <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s newly-elected <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, was sworn into office In his four weeks as governor, <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON> did nothing of consequence, said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, a history professor at <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` He was a colorful, very adroit and pragmatic politician who always seemed to manage to land on his feet,'' said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. `` In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> during Reconstruction, that was no mean feat.'' <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON> later was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but was not seated because the vote was contested.

<HEAD>Availability of Abortion May One Day Hinge on State Courts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The availability of legal abortions for many women may one day hinge on rulings by their state's highest court, a key but often-overlooked battleground in the political fight over abortion. Public focus thus far has centered on state legislatures, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. But the role of state courts was dramatically underscored on Oct. 5, when the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the state constitution gives women a right to abortion. As a result, women in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> would be unaffected if the nation's highest court some day reverses its landmark 1973 decision and says the federal Constitution does not provide the right to abortion. If the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> merely passed a law criminalizing abortions, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> surely would overturn it. Anti-abortion activists instead would have to try to amend the state constitution, an involved process not undertaken successfully since 1968. A state may never give its citizens fewer rights than those guaranteed by the federal Constitution, but it is free to provide greater rights. And the ultimate interpreter of each state's constitution is not the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> but that state's highest court For example, although governmental refusals to fund abortions for women on welfare have survived attacks based on the federal Constitution, such refusals were ruled invalid under the constitutions of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> court's broad ruling was not unprecedented. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> years ago found an abortion right in its state's constitution. Both state courts based their decisions on explicit statements guaranteeing the right of privacy. Although no other court has ruled directly on a right to abortion, at least five other state constitutions _ those of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> _ provide a right of privacy. In a few other states, most notably <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, rulings by the highest court have implied a state privacy right that could include the right to abortion. `` We have studied those state constitutions and are looking at the makeup of the highest court in each of those states,'' said <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnsen </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Part of the abortion rights strategy will be to ask state, not federal, courts to overturn new restrictive laws based on state constitutional grounds. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaulding </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says her organization began to focus on state constitutions long before the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> ruling. `` This battle will be in the states, and state court rulings on their constitutions therefore are included,'' she said. `` We know we have a problem in some states, and we are studying the matter.'' In those states in which there is no state constitutional right of privacy, challenges to restrictive abortion laws might be based on such legal notions as liberty, due process, equal protection and sexual equality. Such moves likely will be accompanied by efforts, on both sides of the fight, to amend state constitutions and to reshape the memberships of state legislatures and high courts. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> says getting more abortion rights supporters appointed to state high courts must be made part of `` the feminization of power'' her group seeks. `` State courts are part of the political package we are looking at,'' she said. `` They are present and future arenas.''

 Before Solidarity took power in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> was the communist government's `` enemy No. 1'' because for 24 years he headed the Polish section of Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the U.S.-sponsored radio station that beams into the Soviet bloc. When <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Aug. 28 for his first visit since 1945, he was stunned to find the airport crammed with senior Solidarity leaders. They took time out from forming the first non-communist government in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> to welcome him as a hero. <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> called <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>'s return `` a visible symbol of change,'' said <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, and his warm reception was symbolic of an improved status for Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty behind the crumbling Iron Curtain. The stations were created in 1950 and 1951 during the Cold War, and despite their ups and downs over the years, are thriving in the current thaw. <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> headed the Polish section for 24 years starting in 1951. Official Polish television, which formerly condemned the so-called `` foreign voices'' that carried news censored from state-run media, not only reported <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>'s triumphant return, it broadcast an interview with him. When <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> stepped out the next day, `` to take a nostalgic walk through the city I had not visited for 45 years,'' a taxi driver veered over, took him around town, and refused to accept payment. `` The driver told me he had seen the airport arrival on television. He said, ` I listened to Radio Free Europe for so many years without paying anything. How can I take money from you?'' <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, 76, recalled during an interview after he returned to his home near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Like <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> and its sister station, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>, are enjoying their new role not only in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other countries of the communist bloc. `` It has become a very exciting place to be ... The radios are on the cutting edge'' of the changes underway in the Soviet bloc, said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> correspondent who now directs the twin radio stations. The stations were founded by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and in 1971, after revelations of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> misdeeds, were separated from the spy agency and funded by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Congressional reports requested by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1984-85 criticized the stations for sometimes broadcasting material considered abusive of communist and government officials in the Soviet bloc. Since <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> took over in November 1985, said a foreign relations committee aide, `` he has done a fine job in curbing the problems we saw four years ago.'' But media in the Soviet bloc continued to depict `` the voices'' as branches of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, jammed their broadcasts to major cities, and bitterly condemned emigres like <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> who worked for them. Nevertheless, the stations had an audience estimated at 50 million, according to the 1985 congressional report. Under the reforms launched since then by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the vituperation has ended and the audience has expanded. `` The major breakthrough was in November of last year, when they turned the jammers off,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said in a recent interview in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Taking advantage of the thaw, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>, which broadcasts to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, has hired reporters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Novosibirsk </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, who was the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the late 1970's, when most Soviets feared speaking with Westerners and could receive prison sentences of up to seven years for listening to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ which broadcasts to the rest of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> bloc </LOCATION> _ has received permission to open an office in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, and wants a bureau in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Official press criticisms have tapered off, and the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> last year praised <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of the December 1988 earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, calling it better than Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s. `` In this case, we heard on a foreign band what we should have heard on our own,'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostrogorsky </PERSON> wrote in the Dec. 18, 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Although <PERSON> Ostrogorsky </PERSON> said the `` voices'' in the past had broadcast `` rumors, misrepresentations and outright lies,'' and had `` pushed their own ideological goods packaged as information,'' he praised the end of the jamming as testimony `` to the progress of glasnost'' or greater openness. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said, `` Simultaneously, another thing happened, the most significant of all. The place opened up. We could call people, they could call us.'' Broadcasters in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> tape reports from throughout the Soviet bloc, and transmit them back in. `` We now have a broadcast called ` at the kiosk,' in which our <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> correspondent reads excerpts from press reports the same day they are published,'' said <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>. The show is popular because the most interesting newspapers sell out quickly even in major cities, and may not be available at all elsewhere.

 State police and guards kept watch Sunday over the remaining inmates at a riot-torn state prison, and investigations were planned to determine what caused two nights of bloody violence at the overcrowded penitentiary. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a small fire broke out at a city prison Sunday night, forcing authorities to move about 100 inmates, said a police detective who spoke on condition of anonymity. No one was injured in the fire at <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which came one night after a much more serious riot at another city prison and was the fifth disturbance to hit a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> prison within a week. The 100 inmates were taken to a gymnasium as smoke from the fire cleared, the detective said. Four young men refused to return to their cells, and guards forced them to return, according to the officer. The prison near <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where more than 100 people were injured in two nights of rioting last week, was calm Sunday, said <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. The uprising there and at other prisons resulted in injuries to at least 183 people. Camp <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s troubles came between a disturbance at the <LOCATION> Huntingdon </LOCATION> state prison that left 48 injured last Monday and one at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prison Saturday night, which resulted in serious injuries to three guards and the hospitalization of nine inmates. The Camp Hill uprising left at least 123 injured, almost half of the facility's buildings destroyed or damaged by fire, and hundreds of inmates without cells. Five people taken hostage Thursday were released Friday when state police stormed the prison, restoring order after a building-by-building assault. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said 744 Camp <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> inmates had been transferred to other state prisons since Friday. He said 200 more inmates would be sent to a new federal prison in <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and as many as 600 others would be sent in groups of 50 to other federal jails. Hundreds of convicts had been forced to sleep on the ground at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> under the eyes of guards and police officers. With the transfers and cleaning and repairing cells at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, officials hoped to make cell space available for all inmates by Monday, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` We've got a lot of people in there cleaning up cellblocks as well as the kitchen buildings,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. The disturbance Saturday at <LOCATION> Holmesburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, a county jail in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, was a `` copycat'' of the <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> riot, said city Prison Commissioner <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. During the riot, which officials said began after an argument between several prisoners and a guard, inmates could be heard chanting, `` <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>.'' Forty-seven guards and 114 inmates were taken to hospitals, and nine inmates were admitted, three with head wounds, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. Other convicts suffered broken bones and cuts, said hospital officials, who did not have an exact count. Three of the 47 guards suffered broken bones and deep cuts, but none were hospitalized, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said Saturday that he would appoint an independent commission to investigate why inmates rebelled at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Wednesday and how they were able to get out of their locked cells to resume and escalate the violence Thursday. The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> also planned to conduct their own reviews. At least one of the committees plans to study prison overcrowding, a problem at both state and county prisons. Officials say overcrowding may have been a contributing factor to the two state-prison problems as well as the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> disturbance. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said he also would back a criminal investigation of the riot, accelerate plans to replace the lost prison space and lessen overcrowding elsewhere, move to punish the inmates behind the uprising and review the need for more corrections officers. After the first day of violence ended Wednesday, <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> superintendent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said the prison did not have enough guards to deal with the prison population, which was 45 percent over capacity when the riots began. No damage estimate was available yet. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said four of the five hostages Thursday had been released from hospitals. The remaining guard was in fair condition. Three other prison staffers and six convicts also remained hospitalized Sunday.

<HEAD>Congress Looking Into Decline in US Oats Production</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oats production is prompting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to look into the situation, and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts say consumer demand for oatmeal is one of the many factors for consideration. Some believe the government's price support program for oats should be modified to encourage farmers to plant more oats instead of turning to other feed grains such as barley, corn or sorghum. Whatever remedies are forthcoming, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1982 has been a net importer of oats instead of an exporter. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> are the major foreign suppliers. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share of all world -LRB- oats -RRB- imports rose to an annual average of 44 percent in 1985-88, largest of all importing countries,'' says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The agency, in a new staff report prepared as background for 1990 farm legislation, said oats are grown in most states but are concentrated in the North Central region, including the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. In the 1950s, oats were grown on more than 40 million acres, and annual farm prices averaged 58 cents to 72 cents per bushel. In recent years, oats have been produced on 6 million to 10 million acres, with farm prices climbing from $ 1.21 per bushel in 1986 to $ 1.56 in 1987 and a record $ 2.67 in 1988. The value of oats production in 1987 ranked 16th among major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> field crops at $ 606 million. By comparison, corn was $ 14 billion; soybeans, $ 11.3 billion; hay, $ 9 billion; and wheat, $ 5.5 billion. `` The principal domestic use of oats is for livestock feed, although it has recently become a specialty feed for race and pleasure horses,'' the report said. Oats as human food includes the traditional oatmeal, along with oat flour, natural cereals, meat product extenders, cookies and breads, granola, oat bran and baby food. `` Recent medical research has shown that certain fibrous plant materials in the diet can lower serum cholesterol concentrations,'' the report said. `` The fibers, however, must be water soluble. Oat bran is water soluble, but wheat bran is not. Water-soluble dietary fibers also lower post-meal blood glucose levels in insulin-dependent diabetics.'' The report added: `` Thus, oat bran or whole oats is beginning to play a larger role in improving health through diet. Oats consumption by humans appears to be increasing, as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diets seem to be shifting toward cereal-based foods and away from fatty, high-protein animal-based foods.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientists say they have developed a new lethal snack for cockroaches, grasshoppers, crickets and fire ants that smells too yummy to resist. The bait includes corn mash left over from the manufacture of fuel-grade alcohol, ethanol, and a water-absorbent gel. The mixture is laced with a slow-release insecticide. According to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the new bait was initially designed to use against cockroaches. But researchers at the agencies insect laboratory in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, found it attracted the other species, too. Entomologist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> said the combination of corn mash and gel tends to retain moisture and `` remains aromatic under high temperatures and dry conditions.'' That makes it particularly attractive to roaches, which become hungry and thirsty when the temperature rises. The bait has been tested in the field as well as in the laboratory, and is waiting on approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Although the mash-gel combination was developed by <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> and an agency colleague, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, there are two other co-inventors: <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Cashier, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hult </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Air Vent and <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> signed research agreements with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency in February 1988 and hold first rights to license the bait when a patent is granted <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, to protect the bait's aroma and moisture during storage, suggested wrapping the bait in wax film that a hungry cockroach can open easily. <PERSON> Hult </PERSON> recommended using a bait holder, which would extend the shelf life of the mixture and protect it until ready for use. <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> said that while the corn mash attracts roaches, hoppers, crickets and fire ants, it does n't attract warm-blooded animals as do baits of fruit, bread, raisins or beer.

 A trainer jet crash-landed Sunday afternoon on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, killing five people and injuring at least two, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The 3:30 p.m. CST crash of the two-seat T-2 <LOCATION> Buckeye </LOCATION> caused several fires on the World War II-era ship that sailors quickly brought under control, officials said. The <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s oldest aircraft carrier, was 30 miles south of its home port of <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> when the accident occurred, said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a civilian spokesman at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. Officers on the ship said five people were killed in the crash-landing and at least two were injured, said White. The jet was assigned to <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> 19, based at the <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The victims' identities were being withheld pending notification of their relatives In addition to destroying the jet, the crash did major damage to two aircraft on the flight deck and minor damage to another, said Army Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokesman at the Pentagon. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopters took the dead and injured to the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, and to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in Mobile, authorities said. One of the injured, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 21, was in critical but stable condition at the Mobile hospital with second - and third-degree burns over 40 to 45 percent of his body, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> was the only sailor brought to that hospital, she said. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said he did not know <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>'s rank or hometown. The <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> was heading back to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, and was expected to arrive at the city's commercial port around 10 a.m. Monday, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> sent a jet from Mobile to fly a team of ordnance experts in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> apparently was concerned that fuel cells aboard the jet might explode after being damaged in the crash, <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON> said. The 46-year-old <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> is the only aircraft carrier used exclusively by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for training. It has 1,440 men and women assigned to it. The accident occurred a week before the 45th anniversary of a Japanese kamikaze attack that killed 47 crew members and injured 127 on Nov. 4, 1944. The original <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> crew plans to hold a reunion next weekend in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> that includes a day cruise on the carrier on Saturday, Nov. 4, to commemorate the attack. The <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> was commissioned on Feb. 17, 1943. Its planes sank or destroyed more than a million tons of Japanese shipping and 1,039 enemy aircraft. The carrier was dubbed `` The Blue Ghost'' by Japanese propagandist <PERSON> Tokyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> during World War II because she had reported it sunk several times only to have it return to battle, painted a solid blue-grey color, unusual in wartime when ships are usually camouflaged. The <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> was mothballed after the war, but was reactivated in 1955. It reported to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> on Dec. 29, 1962, to serve as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s training carrier. It is scheduled to continue that role after moving next September to <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The ship has been a favorite of movie producers with roles in the film `` Midway'' and the made-for-television mini-series `` War and Remembrance.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is being asked to decide whether a federal judge may impose a tax increase to pay for court-ordered school desegregation in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. At issue in today's oral arguments is a federal judge's 1987 order doubling the property tax of residents in the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> school district to finance a court-ordered plan for racially desegregating the public schools. Legal scholars and education officials say the court's decision could shape future school desegregation plans across the country and define the federal courts' power to remedy constitutional violations involving issues from prison overcrowding to fair housing. The state of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> is asking the justices to overturn a decision by the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that upheld the property tax increase ordered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. The state contends that the federal courts lack the power to order higher taxes even to correct a constitutional violation such as racial discrimination in schools. The school district and a group of school children, who brought the original desegregation case in 1977, are urging the high court to uphold the tax decision. The district contends that state property tax law and local voters can not be allowed to frustrate the constitutional rights of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s minority schoolchildren to an equal educational opportunity. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> ordered the tax increase in September 1987 after the local school district was unable to pay its share of a more than $ 400 million desegregation plan he had approved for capital improvements in buildings and establishment of special `` magnet'' schools. State law says local property taxes may be raised only with voters' approval, and in some instances only with a two-thirds majority. District voters had not approved a levy increase since 1969, with four tax increase proposals rejected in 1986 and 1987 to finance the desegregation plan. In addition to doubling the property tax, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> imposed an income tax surcharge on those people living or working in the school district. The appeals court struck down the income surcharge in August 1988, but upheld the district court's authority to order an increase in the property tax. However, the appeals court modified the procedure for imposing the higher tax levy. The appeals court found that state law had effectively prevented the school district from levying the necessary taxes to pay for the desegregation plan. It upheld <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s order as one that `` set aside levy limitations,'' and empowered the elected local school board to set the needed tax levels within certain limits.

 Nearly six weeks after Hurricane Hugo hit, horse carriages are clopping through city streets, golfers are back on the links, and tourism officials have begun a campaign to lure tourists back. `` We want to create an awareness that we were n't wiped off the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stansell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, which cut a swath of destruction along more than half of the state's 187-mile coastline on Sept. 21, resulted in an estimated $ 200 million loss to the state's $ 4.7 billion a year tourism industry. The industry provides 98,000 jobs and $ 280 million annually in state tax revenues. `` What we had hoped for was an 8 percent growth on $ 4.7 billion spending in 1988,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Liming </PERSON>, tourism director for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION>, Recreation and Tourism. `` What we're looking at now is a growth of 3 to 4 percent,'' he said. `` We did have a very good summer and the first part of the fall was good from Labor Day until the storm hit.'' State and local tourism groups are telling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian travel agents that travel spots are open. <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> officials are raising $ 500,000 for a national advertising campaign. In the <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> area, 62 of the area's 63 golf courses are open. <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and other tourist points south of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> sustained little, if any damage. In <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, about 95 percent of the 10,000 tourist rooms are open, and most of the area's more than 500 restaurants have reopened, Ms. <PERSON> Stansell </PERSON> said. The annual candlelight tour of historic homes is scheduled for next month, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired, reopened to visitors last week. `` The Number 1 reason people come to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> is because of the historic appeal. We were fortunate we did n't lose any of that,'' she said. Nearby <LOCATION> Ashley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plantation museums have reopened. Post-storm reports that <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> Place plantation was destroyed were exaggerated, apparently when reporters flying over it thought the ruins left by <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>'s troops in the Civil War were from Hugo. At the Patriots Point maritime museum in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Cooper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, the storm knocked the 27,100-ton aircraft carrier <PERSON> Yorktown </PERSON> into a pier. Still, the museum reopened about 1 -LCB- weeks later. Some attractions will take longer to recover. <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plantation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleasant </ORGANIZATION> is n't expected to reopen until around Thanksgiving, and <ORGANIZATION> Charlestown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Landing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> will remain closed until at least January, said Ms. <PERSON> Stansell </PERSON>. The worst damage was on the state's beachfront, where <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> washed away homes and condominiums. But most major hotels survived and the beach season is over for the year. Wild Dunes resort on the Isle of Palms again plans to play host to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Clay Courts tennis championship in the spring, officials said. And <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> escaped unscathed, although cancellations in the wake of Hugo resulted in an estimated $ 2.5 million loss. The state has embarked on a plan to restore beaches in the <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> area with Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> promising that tourists next year will find those beaches in better shape than before the storm. Publicity about the storm ironically may prove a boon. `` What we're finding is that people who did n't know <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> had so much beach and so many historic sites do now,'' said <PERSON> Liming </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Congressional conservatives, grappling with glasnost, are having trouble coming to terms with the changes, disclosures and confessions of the government of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. There is little unity of opinion. An example is the reaction to the recent admissions by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> regarding <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the construction of a long-controversial advanced radar system. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> admitted the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 was immoral, illegal and a mistake. He said construction of a sophisticated, phased-array radar system at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> in the central <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was what its critics always said it was _ an outright and direct violation of the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty. Two of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s most conservative members took a look at the two confessions and came away with sharply different impressions of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s new openness. One said glasnost had brought new evidence of Soviet duplicity, new reason to distrust any arms control treaty with the Kremlin. The other saw a new cause for hope. One offered applause; the other, jeers. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, said the admission that the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar was a treaty violation is all the evidence one could want that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intends to violate treaties before it signs them, does violate them, lies about the violations and ca n't be trusted, now or in the future. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, however, reacted to the news of the Soviet change of position on the invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by saying, `` Bravo.'' The policy shift could be the beginning of a turnaround to permit the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> people to choose their own government, free of Soviet intervention, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. Concentrating on <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s admission about the radar, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said he had pointed to it as the `` smoking gun of Soviet arms control cheating'' shortly after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence detected it in summer 1983. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> noted that Soviet officials spent years denying the radar installation was a treaty violation. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> concluded: `` Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has finally admitted the fundamental duplicity of Soviet foreign policy. He has finally admitted that the Soviets conduct arms control negotiations on the basis of falsehood, cheat on solemn arms control treaties and then try to camouflage and conceal their duplicity.'' The admission confirms the suspicion that the Soviets signed the ABM treaty, the SALT I and SALT II treaties, and the Intermediate Nuclear Forces or INF treaty fully intending to violate all of them, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> asserted. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said he believed the Soviets made the admission only because the evidence had become so massive that it constituted `` a significant barrier to improving U.S.-Soviet relations.'' `` This admission totally undermines any basis of trust in future treaties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> asserted. Focusing on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> sounded an opposite note. Glasnost appears to be paying dividends at last, he said. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> has been the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s most persistent and outspoken critic of the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But now, he said, `` the time has come for some praise.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called the Soviet invasion _ which occurred during the rule of the late Soviet President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> _ `` the most serious violation of our own legislation, of party and civic norms and ethical standards of the times.'' `` This sort of frank admission of sins long denied bodes well for the success of glasnost, for openness and honesty of Soviet officials,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. `` ... I say bravo.'' The admission of error, he said, allows him to hope that the Soviets soon will end their support for the Marxist regime left behind in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> when the Soviet occupation army withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> concluded: `` I salute Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the courage to proclaim glasnost, for the courage to persist where glasnost has led to painful re-evaluations and even admissions of grave error.''

<TEXT>
 The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> matched its year-old record for homicides Sunday with five killings during a seven-hour weekend period that pushed this year's total to 369 homicides. Three of the weekend killings were linked to drugs, as are the majority of the deaths in the nation's capital, and the other two were a 13-year-old girl and her aunt who were found stabbed to death in their apartment on Saturday. The most recent victim was a 41-year-old man found dead of multiple gunshot wounds early Sunday. He had $ 11,000 cash and a large quantity of heroin in his pockets when his body was found, according to police homicide detectives. `` It's awful. But people in this community are resorting to deadly violence to resolve conflict,'' said police spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Police have estimated more than half the city's killings are tied to drugs, with crack cocaine fueling much of the violence. They said last at the end of 1988 that 372 people were killed in homicides, but a police revised that number downward Sunday when they subtracted three victims of police shootings from the official total. Police said they charged <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, 24, with two counts of murder in the deaths late Saturday night of <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sams </PERSON>, 34, and her niece, <PERSON> Keaena </PERSON> <PERSON> Sams </PERSON>. Police described <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> as <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sams </PERSON>' boyfriend.

<HEAD>Socialists Win Third Majority, But By a Single Seat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Socialists scored a third straight electoral victory, but Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s parliamentary majority dwindled to just one seat through defections to the left, results showed today Analysts credited a four-year economic boom and confidence in the future as helping push the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> over the top in Sunday's general elections. However, they said, the governing party's majority was sharply reduced because organized labor was angry over <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s pro-business policies and unwillingness to further boost social spending The man who first rose to power in 1982 has helped give <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s fastest growing economy. In Sunday's balloting, the Socialists won 176 seats, or 39.55 percent of the vote, the minimum needed for a majority of the 350 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s powerful lower house. They had won 184 seats in 1986 elections. The biggest gains were won by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> coalition that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which increased its seats to 17, with 9 percent of the vote, from the seven seats in 1986. With all the votes counted, Interior Minister <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcuera </PERSON> also announced these results early today in the Cortes, or lower house: the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, 106 seats, 25.83 percent of the vote; the <ORGANIZATION> Catalan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, 18 seats, 5 percent; the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of former prime minister <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, 14 seats, 8 percent. The remaining seats were divided among eight smaller parties. The <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> under 36-year-old <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Aznar </PERSON>, an inexperienced former tax collector who took over just two months ago, remained the largest opposition force. However, it gained just one seat in this election. In the 208-seat <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the Socialists won 109 seats, the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 74, the Convergence and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> 10, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> 1 and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> 3. The remaining seats went to the smaller parties. During the campaign, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Anguita </PERSON> hammered away at the Socialists, saying they had failed to distribute fairly the benefits of the country's newly generated wealth. The Communists won 20 seats in 1977 general elections after the death two years earlier of Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s return to democracy. However, they had suffered a constant decline until Sunday's vote. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a 47-year-old former labor lawyer and underground political activist during the Franco era, has provided the country with firm leadership, guiding it out of near bankruptcy in 1982 to solvency and a starring role in the 12-nation European Community. `` With these results, it is possible to govern -LRB- alone -RRB-,'' the prime minister said, `` and we're going to do it with the same hope and democratic attitude we've shown since 1982,'' when he swept to victory with a landslide. Analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> won the protest vote by throwing support behind the nation's two largest unions in their bitter battle with the government for greater spending on pensions, unemployment insurance and wages for civil servants. The coalition went from fewer than 1 million votes in 1986 to 1.8 million votes Sunday, apparently snapping up the 900,000 votes that the Socialists lost, according to electoral experts. However, Economy Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Solchaga </PERSON> quickly dismissed any notion that the coalition would influence the Socialists to move away from the pro-business policies that have contributed to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s average growth rate of 4.5 percent over the past four years, the highest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said the Socialist government `` needs no leftward swing or allies.'' Inflation dropped from 14 percent in 1982 to 5 percent last year, although it is now running at 7 percent. `` Despite the drop in votes, any way one looks at the third Socialist majority, it appears to be further confirmation that the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> society sees <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> as its best leader,'' said veteran political comentator <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Altares </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is the third European country, after <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, to witness three successive terms of Socialist majority governments. The 69.9 percent turnout rate among the nation's 29.5 million registered voters was up slightly from the 68.9 percent in the 1986 elections. But it was significantly lower than the 80 percent in the 1982 contest.

<HEAD>Kremlin Would Not Object to Hungary Leaving Warsaw Pact, Official
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official expresses surprise at Soviet statements that the Kremlin would not object if <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> chose to leave the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pact </LOCATION> <LOCATION> or </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> chose to reunite with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> said Sunday the remarks by Soviet party spokesman <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shishlin </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact indicated a new Kremlin policy. `` I found his description about what the commitment to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact was, rather surprising,'' <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' program `` He seemed to suggest that there was choice involved,'' <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> said. `` That would be welcome news, if it is correct. But that is not what the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government has been saying,'' <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> said. Previously, Soviet and Hungarian officials have stressed that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would stay in the Kremlin-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military alliance. The statements by <PERSON> Shishlin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> followed a declaration by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last week his nation had no moral right to interfere with changes underway in the Soviet bloc nations of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also declared a willingness to dissolve the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact if the West disbands the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a step the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has rejected as an effort to cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shishlin </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, was asked whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would object if <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> decided to leave the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. `` We respect the Hungarian choice, anyhow. We are not afraid of these changes,'' said <PERSON> Shishlin </PERSON>. Asked whether <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was `` free to leave the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact,'' <PERSON> Shishlin </PERSON> replied: `` Surely. But you know that Hungarian officials declared that they are ready to be in the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, until now.'' In 1956, a declaration by Hungarian leader <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> that his nation would quit the alliance prompted Soviet military intervention. In recent months, reform leaders elected to power in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have declared their intention to remain in the Soviet alliance. <PERSON> Shishlin </PERSON> also appeared to leave the door open to reunification of West and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which have been divided since World War II. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and West German governments historically have favored unification, but the East German and Soviet governments have not. In light of the turmoil in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shishlin </PERSON> said: `` Nobody can predict what will happen. And I am sure that this situation should be changed and it will be changed.'' `` How will it be changed?,'' <PERSON> Shishlin </PERSON> was asked. `` By the right of choice,'' he replied. `` Everything depends on the Germans. But it is necessary to understand our interests, not to destabilize the situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Let us wait a little bit, and I think we will find a new situation.'' Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, appearing on the syndicated program, `` One-On-One,'' called the new policy `` the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> <PERSON> Doctrine </PERSON>.'' `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> has a very popular song, ` I Had it My Way.' So, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, every other country, has its own way. They decide which road to take. It's their business. And we watch, watch closely, but we do not interfere,'' said <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, appearing on a different segment of `` One-on-One,'' said the administration was `` encouraged by President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statement and the fact that he says that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> does not have the right to interfere ... with Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. That's positive.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> advised caution in reacting to statements by Soviet leaders. `` We hope that perestroika succeeds,'' he said, using the Russian word for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. `` But as they talk about the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> doctrine _ also remember the <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> doctrine in song, ` These Boots Are Made for Walking.'''

 As rescue workers dug for earthquake victims amid the crushed bodies and smell of death on the collapsed Nimitz freeway, the minds of some were not in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> but in the steaming jungles of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. A stress expert said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans among the rescue workers began suffering emotional flashbacks as they pulled body after body from the rubble of the freeway that collapsed during the Oct. 17 quake, killing at least 39 people. `` More than half the construction workers were <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a psychologist and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran himself who went to the freeway to counsel workers. `` They started talking about <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> again.'' While the most obvious stress victims are those who lost a loved one and workers dealing with violent death, experts say everyone who lived through the temblor is at risk of emotional upheaval. `` There are 6 million people affected emotionally by the quake in this area,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> looks normal, but if you stop anybody and ask them where they were during the earthquake, you will listen to a litany of stress.'' Social workers and mental health experts warn that increases in physical abuse, depression and possibly suicide will follow the 7.1-magnitude quake, which killed at least 64 people. The toll is already mounting: <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials reported 37 new complaints of physical and sexual abuse after the quake, double the normal rate. Three women, an unusually high number, were reported raped in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> the week after the quake. In hard-hit <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, at least two women have been publicly beaten by their husbands in the tent cities. The number of battered women seeking shelter at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rosalie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is up 20 percent since the quake. Calls to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alameda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hayward </LOCATION> have tripled. Throughout the region there are reports of people afraid to return to their homes. <ORGANIZATION> Suicide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> reported twice as many calls as usual in the past week, with 90 percent related to the quake. Mental health experts say the best therapy is for everyone in the area to talk openly about the earthquake. The apparent rise in domestic violence may stem from feelings of hopelessness that a natural disaster can generate, said Dr. <PERSON> Etta </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Post-traumatic stress disorders, usually associated with war experiences and often taking months to appear, are also expected to increase, she said. Among the hardest hit people were the concrete and steel workers, who busted through the Interstate 880 roadway to expose vehicles that time and again contained mangled bodies, said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, who spoke to a fortuitously-timed Society for Traumatic Stress Studies convention here over the weekend. The Veterans Administration sent stress counselors to the Nimitz highway, to help the former soldiers talk through their feelings, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The convention, planned a year ago, brought 500 experts in stress management to the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. They fanned out to disaster sites, suicide prevention centers and talked to people at businesses. People in the region have swung rapidly through a gamut of strong emotions including shock, excitement and euphoria at being alive, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` Now there is exhaustion,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` They are feeling a little helpless as reality is sinking in.''

 The dollar declined against the Japanese yen today, while share prices also fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in sluggish trading. The dollar ended the day's trading at 142.17 yen, down 0.58 yen from Friday's close of 142.75 yen. It opened at 141.70 yen and ranged between 141.70 and 142.38 yen. The dollar closed at 141.70 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday. Currency dealers said dollar-buying by institutional investors in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> was helping to shore up the dollar against selling pressure. A dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said market players are awaiting a spate of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic data, including the country's advance economic indicators for September, due out Tuesday, and the October employment figures, due Friday. A lack of market-moving news and uncertainty over trends in the stock market kept the market fairly quiet, said <PERSON> Kaneo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogino </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>. `` It depends on the stock market. Whatever happens there, the dollar will follow,'' <PERSON> Ogino </PERSON> said. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which lost 151.90 points Friday, shed another 109.85 points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 35,417.44. Profit taking pushed the Nikkei average 141.30 points lower early in the day but it recovered somewhat later on buying of domestic demand-related issues like construction and fuel shares, said <ORGANIZATION> Wako </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> dealer <PERSON> Shingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON>. Only 600 million shares changed hands, down from 1.24 billion shares Friday. Investors, who took profits Friday, remained on the sidelines today due to uncertainty in the foreign exchange market and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stock market, traders said.

<HEAD>Minorities Twice As Likely to be Crime Victims, Justice Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Blacks and Hispanics were about twice as likely to be crime victims as whites last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. While whites were robbed at the rate of 4.7 per 1,000 people during 1988, the rate for blacks was 9.4 and for Hispanics, 10.1, said the bureau's National Crime Survey released Sunday. Males, young people, inner-city residents and renters also were more likely to have been crime victims last year. The rates of violent crimes and personal thefts increased last year for the second straight year but remained below the high rates of the 1970s and early 1980s, the bureau said. The bureau said those two categories of crimes rose 3.1 percent last year from 1987. Crime rates were highest in the West _ 126 personal crimes per 1,000 persons and 224 household crimes per 1,000 households. The Northeast had the lowest rates _ 73 personal crimes per 1,000 and 115 household crimes per 1,000. The National Crime Survey figures for 1988 were based on interviews with 101,000 people 12 years or older in 50,000 homes.

Millions of people went outdoors to watch a similar event in the spring of 1988, according to the popular astronomy magazine. At sunset, the planet will appear to the right of the crescent moon. Also visible should be Saturn, to the upper left, though it will be much fainter. With luck, the magazine adds, viewers may be able to observe the phenomenon of `` earthshine.'' That is the reflected light from the Earth brightening the normally dark portion of the moon so it becomes visible, although not as bright as the crescent portion which is lighted by sunlight. Because the dark section of the moon glows dimly gray when this occurs, it has been called `` the old moon in the new moon's arms.''

 Attackers on a motorcycle shot and wounded two journalists in front of a television studio just hours after a purported cocaine kingpin was sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be prosecuted. No group claimed responsibility for Sunday's shooting in the capital, but it appeared to be yet another response by cocaine barons to the government's extradition of accused drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel's reputed master smuggler, was handed over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics agents before dawn Sunday at a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> airport and then flown to <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> to face drug charges, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said. He was the fifth and most important drug-trafficking suspect extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government began an all-out war on drug gangs 10 weeks ago. Eight more suspects are being held for extradition. In Sunday's attack, the two gunmen on a motorcycle shot <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulido </PERSON>, producer of the news program `` Mundo Vision,'' and newswoman <PERSON> Ximena </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> as they got into a car after leaving the studio, police said. <PERSON> Pulido </PERSON>, 45, was shot twice in the shoulder and once in the throat, and Ms. <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>, 22, was hit in the leg, a police spokesman said. Both were in stable condition at a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> hospital. Police said they captured one suspect and he was being questioned. <PERSON> Pulido </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> were the ninth and 10th news industry employees shot since the government began its crackdown in August after the assassination of a leading presidential candidate. The other eight died. In the week after the crackdown began, a group of drug traffickers calling itself the Extraditables vowed in a letter sent to a radio network to attack the country's journalists and public figures. Since then, the offices of two newspapers have been bombed. Police said four bombs exploded in different locations in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> on Sunday night, causing damage but no casualties. Twenty-two people have been killed and 220 injured over the past 10 weeks in at least 175 bombings, which the government blames on traffickers. In <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy and distribution of cocaine during his arraignment before a federal judge There was no discussion of bond. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> would remain in the custody of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> pending another hearing Thursday. `` The arrest and extradition of <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> represent a significant step in the federal anti-drug offensive,'' acting <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> `` was considered a major transporter for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel.'' <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> was arrested Oct. 10 in a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> restaurant. Police said he had undergone plastic surgery to avoid detection. He was indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> on Sept. 2, 1987, along with <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> stock broker <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Palmero </PERSON> later was convicted on drug distribution charges and sentenced to 16 years in prison. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment accuses <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> of involvement in a conspiracy to ship more than 1,700 pounds of cocaine and 6,200 pounds of marijuana to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> is the most important drug trafficking suspect snared so far in the drug crackdown, he does not figure in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s list of the 12 most wanted traffickers. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has not captured any of those suspects, who include the leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cali </ORGANIZATION> cartels.

<HEAD>DC Murder Toll Equals 1988 Record, With Two Months to Go</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 homicide toll already equals last year's record of 369 killings _ with more than half blamed on drug-related violence _ and officials say they see no end in sight. With two months remaining in 1989, district police reported that five slayings discovered during a seven-hour period over the weekend brought the tally to last year's record death total. Three of the weekend killings were linked to drugs. The other two were a 13-year-old girl and her aunt who were found stabbed to death in their apartment Saturday. Police blame more than 60 percent of the district's slayings on drugs, particularly the arrival of crack cocaine. The federal government is making the nation's capital a test case for national anti-drug strategies, and city police are working long hours trying to curb drug-related violence. `` It's awful. But people in this community are resorting to deadly violence to resolve conflict,'' said police spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The most recent victim of the weekend was a 41-year-old man found dead of multiple gunshot wounds early Sunday. He had $ 11,000 cash and a large quantity of heroin in his pockets when his body was found, according to police detectives. At the end of 1988, police had said 372 people were killed in homicides, but they revised that number downward Sunday by subtracting three victims of police shootings from the official total. D.C. Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, whose political fortunes are slipping partly because the murder rate is skyrocketing, calls the problem `` unstoppable.'' National Drug Policy Coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> acknowledged recently that the district's drug and crime problem _ the focus of special attention from his office _ will be difficult to solve. `` No one should be surprised to learn that the nation's capital is still plagued by a serious drug problem,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said while reviewing federal efforts in the district's drug war. `` The drug-related murder rate is intolerably high, the prisons are too crowded, drugs continue to be sold openly around schools, parks and housing projects.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has lent federal prison space, special agents and investigative tools to the city's anti-drug effort, and city police have been working 12-hour shifts patrolling drug-infested neighborhoods and housing projects. But on Friday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed the city's annual spending bill, delaying a special $ 32 million federal anti-crime package. By vetoing the bill because it would allow the city to use local tax money to finance Medicaid abortions for poor women, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put on hold a plan to hire 700 extra police, eight new judges, and a host of school-based anti-drug educational programs. `` We're going to have to study whether to cut out overtime,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulwood </PERSON> said after the veto. `` Certainly, we need to rethink purchasing strategies, and slow them down ... This certainly wo n't help fight crime.'' Most city officials feel that until the city's appetite for drugs subsides, there is little they can do. `` The large percentage of the killings are related to the drug scene, and in many cases ... hits that are put out in arguments over turf,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lurma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rackley </PERSON>. `` We can delay them, but as long as the drug market is still thriving, those targeted killings are probably going to continue.'' <PERSON> Fulwood </PERSON>, who has contradicted <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s negative view of the murder situation, said the situation is n't as bleak as the mayor suggested. `` We are making some progress, and there are some things that are positive,'' <PERSON> Fulwood </PERSON> said. `` The number of killings, per day, is decreasing. It's still too high, but we are going in the right direction.'' According to police statistics, 49 people were killed in the nation's capital during August, 32 in September, and 34 in October. Still, the September and October figures represent a murder a day.

 Pumpkin festivals are sprouting in some school districts, where parents are trying to keep Halloween out of the hallways and off school grounds because of its connection with witches and Satan. In <LOCATION> Alachua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyer </PERSON> gathered the signatures of about 200 fellow parents who think the holiday is a religious celebration of Wicca, a modern pagan witchcraft cult. When teachers dress up like witches, `` what happens to these little Christian kids like mine?'' asked <PERSON> Guyer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> law student. `` How are they going to feel when it's dress-up day and they do n't dress up? Officials in <LOCATION> Alachua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> left the decision on Halloween to school principals. In neighboring <LOCATION> Levy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the superintendent asked schools to avoid using Halloween decorations and to cancel school celebrations. Halloween, which is being celebrated Tuesday night, apparently sprang from an ancient ceremony honoring the Celtic god of death. In medieval <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, it came to be known as All Hallows' Eve, celebrated before the feast day of All Hallows, now All Saints' Day As is the case with the pagan Christmas tree, few pay attention to its religious origins. But <PERSON> Guyer </PERSON> cites a recent 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruling in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> that found that prayers before high school football games violate the constitutional separation of church and state. `` As Easter has been banned in favor of spring holiday, as Christmas has been banned in favor of winter holiday, so, too, Halloween should be banned in favor of fall holiday,'' he said. The Rev. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, agreed: `` Some of the symbolism used for Halloween is used also by recognized religions. I think the law as interpreted by the 11th Circuit should be impartially applied to any religious activity at school.'' Halloween's defenders say it has become a non-religious holiday. `` The witches and goblins of Halloween are no more believable than <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>, the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy. ... Are they going to ban those, too?'' asked <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a father of six in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where several schools are inaugurating `` harvest festivals'' in place of Halloween In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> Superintendent <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> responded to parents' anxieties by asking principals to tone down celebrations. `` I asked them to review their practices and if they had anything that depicted blood and <PERSON> gore </PERSON> to try to eliminate that,'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said. An elementary school in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION> planned to celebrate Pumpkin Fun Day rather than Halloween. And in <LOCATION> Frederick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, three elementary schools have discontinued Halloween events. At least one decided to hold a fall celebration instead. `` I personally have trouble defending ghosts and goblins in our instructional curriculum,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a county school official. Parents are upset by lurid descriptions of devil worship on television and in rock music, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenbraun </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eisenbraun </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Worthington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, last week to conduct an Occult Awareness Seminar for teachers, parents and teen-agers. `` Satanists do not isolate themselves to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> or to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Eisenbraun </PERSON> said. `` They like rural areas, like <LOCATION> Worthington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where there's an availability of abandoned buildings, animals, and wide-open areas where there are n't enough cops to check on them. The popularity of slasher movies and costumes that imitate them worry other parents. Movies like `` Halloween'' and `` Friday the 13th,'' are popular enough to make their protagonists among the hottest-selling costumes this year, outfitters say _ along with <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>, the ogre of Elm Street, is n't invited to the Halloween party at the <ORGANIZATION> Bethesda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waukesha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>.

 Opposition activists heartened by their biggest protest in years say their movement is growing but that most people still do n't seem to want to risk what comforts they have by getting involved. In Saturday's protest, more than 10,000 people gathered in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to mark the 71st anniversary of Czechoslovak independence. Police beat several dozen people and arrested 355, including 17 foreigners. The demonstrators called repeatedly for free elections, a new government, and the resignation of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>. His popularity is said by informed Czechs to be sliding even within Communist ranks. The rally was the first in which such strident calls for a new leadership were heard. `` Our -LRB- leadership -RRB- power is much more isolated after the changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' noted <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON>, a former foreign minister and now a leading activist with the Charter 77 human rights group. `` It is still strong and monolithic in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, but they feel more alone.'' The conviction that change is coming has grown markedly in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> in the last two months, buoyed by the dramatic upheaval in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the emergence of a non-Communist government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s bold moves toward democracy. But Czechoslovaks have not suffered the privations endured by Polish, Hungarian and East German consumers, and many apparently are unwilling to risk economic problems in exchange for political change. Fear of losing material possessions coveted and gained by many Czechs and Slovaks _ a car, a country cottage, a videocassette player _ is the great brake on popular protest, said dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Maly </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest. In addition, the government in the past year has loosened restrictions on travel to the West and permitted freer expression in the arts. To date, there has been no stimulus to mass protest like in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where more than 50,000 people have fled to the West since August. With a tradition of caution and peaceful change, many Czechs and Slovaks are not convinced that street demonstrations are the way to achieve reform. This caution makes them wary of striking out for change while they perceive no strong leadership in the 30-odd opposition groups. Banned playwright and activist <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> is virtually the only nationally known figure in the ragged movement. Moreover, Czechs and Slovaks for centuries have resisted their rulers from other, larger nations with wit and ridicule, rather than arms. `` Czechs are able to resist, but not to sacrifice so much,'' <PERSON> Maly </PERSON> said. `` We struggled spiritually.'' The shock of the 1968 <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion to crush <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> spring reforms is also deeply etched in the memory of Czechoslovaks, said <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemcova </PERSON> of Charter 77. `` People really hoped then and then suddenly suffered a blow,'' she noted. The ensuing two decades of `` normalization,'' as it is officially known, have left many citizens very skeptical about change. `` The people are very discontented but feel powerless,'' she said. `` They do n't think words can change anything _ they've heard so many words ... But especially young people are active, and they have decided to struggle for their future.'' <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> abounds with talk of mini-revolts inside the only two parties officially permitted by the ruling Communists, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> In the past, these two parties `` were instruments of the Communist party,'' noted <PERSON> Maly </PERSON>. Now with calls for genuine democracy appearing in both parties and in their daily newspapers, `` that is not so true.''

<HEAD>Rebels Reportedly Take Town With Unified Force; Indication Feuds
Ending</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Guerrilla factions have united to capture a major government garrison in central <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, raising fears in the military that rebel factions are ending feuds, a government source and witnesses said today. Divisions have hurt the U.S-backed guerrillas in their campaign to topple the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government after the last Soviet troops pulled out in February. However, a source in the Moscow-supported government, quoted military officials as saying officers were worried that the fractious rebels are now beginning to join forces. Several guerrillas factions reportedly fought together to capture the south-central city of <PERSON> Sore </PERSON> <PERSON> Kallin </PERSON>. The city is the hometown of the late <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON>, founder of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> and the country's first Communist ruler. Thousands of rebels attacked the <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> province city last week, according to the government source and two truck drivers who arrived in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from the region today. By Friday, rebel forces had routed the 3,000-member government garrison, they said. The truck drivers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported 10 rebels killed and 80 wounded but said they knew nothing of government casualties. Rebels captured many government weapons, including thousands of AK-47 assault rifles, hand grenades and mortars, the government source said. <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON> set up the garrison after he seized power in an April 1978 coup that touched off the country's civil war. Although <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON> was ousted and killed in another coup in September 1979, the garrison had remained among the strongest in <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> province, the government source said. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said rebels have been trying to knock out the garrison for several years. `` The victory was the result of their unity,'' he said. One truck driver said that after the rebel victory, several mullahs, or Moslem clergymen, were hung upside down from trucks after they were accused of supporting the government. The government source said cooperation by separate guerrilla forces on a blockade of the government's main supply route from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also indicated new unity among rebel factions. He said forces loyal to <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> and others led by <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> had been co-ordinating the 10-day blockade on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, the northern route out of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The source said <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON>, a relatively liberal Moslem, had not previously united forces with <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, a fundamentalist Moslem. Rebels have also been blockading the three others highways out of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital, according to private truckers. The blockade was forcing up food prices and raising fears of shortages. More than 2,000 trucks were said to be stuck on <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> north of the fighting. In addition, the rebels also stepped up rocketing on the capital's airport. Soldiers said at least six rockets crashed down there in the early morning today, but no casualties were reported. However, they said air shipments from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were slowing down to about 10 a day from the usual 30. Government officials have said if land and air routes are shut, the capital would be able to survive for about one month. Silos holding about 50,000 tons of flour are said to be full, and the government has also stockpiled gasoline.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner returned to <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> shortly after takeoff when an engine failed and shot off sparks that witnesses said ignited grass fires. `` It looked like a Roman candle,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> resident <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who saw the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 while walking his dog. `` It left a streak of sparks in the sky. There were large chunks flying off of it.'' Flight 691 was bound for <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> with 94 passengers and a crew of seven Sunday night when one of its three engines failed shortly after takeoff, said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>. No injuries were reported, officials said. Sparks coming from the failed engine ignited several grass fires in an open field near the airport, witnesses told the <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Firefighters controled the blazes within an hour. `` It was shooting off sparks and then it seemed to diminish,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. Fire officials could not immediately confirm what started the fires. The Irving fire marshal was expected to investigate the blazes today, said dispatcher <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials said the plane would remain at airport today while investigators attempt to identify the cause of the failure. Airport operation crews closed the runway and found several engine parts, including what appeared to be pieces of turbine fan blades, scattered along the runway, said airport spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dealey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` There was a failure in the engine, causing the parts to scatter,'' <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said, although he did not know whether the engine had caught on fire. `` When the pilot saw he had the problem, he circled the field and returned.'' The plane took off at 7:19 p.m. and returned at 7:37 p.m. The plane taxied to an airport terminal under its own power, said <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION>. Shortly after the aircraft took off, three grass fires were reported in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, about three miles southeast of the airport. The Irving Fire Department responded at 7:29 p.m. to the first report of a grass fire and sent at least four units to the scene, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, 80, of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, a passenger on the plane, said he first knew something was wrong when he heard a loud noise about five minutes into the flight. `` It was a pretty doggone loud noise _ like somebody fired a cannon or something,'' <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> said. `` Before that there were several other noises.'' Passengers boarded another plane that left for <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> at 9:58 p.m., <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Busing a Major Issue in Seattle's Mayoral Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An anti-busing initiative figures strongly in the Nov. 7 mayoral election that will result in either the city's first black or first Republican mayor in more than two decades. Polls have shown strong support for Initiative 34, which is backed by Republican <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>. They also give a slight edge to his opponent, City Councilman <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, who is against the measure. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 46, would be the first black mayor in a city where blacks comprise only about 10 percent of the population. `` If I win, it's going to say that people in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> recognize how hard people work and how well they do their jobs,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>, the 42-year-old city attorney, would be the first Republican to win the non-partisan office since Dorm <PERSON> Braman </PERSON> in 1965. The anti-busing measure asks, but does not require, the independently elected and budgeted city <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to switch from a `` controlled choice'' attendance plan that requires busing of about 10 percent of the 40,000 students for racial balance to a completely open enrollment system. In exchange for abandoning mandatory busing, schools would get about $ 4.5 million in annual sales tax revenue that now goes to the city, with that money reserved for `` magnet'' programs designed to encourage racial balance. <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> finished one-two among 13 candidates in September's primary. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> has trumpeted his Democratic credentials, including endorsements from the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>, and outgoing Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON>, who decided not to run for a fourth term. A random telephone survey of 400 likely voters taken Oct. 13-16 for <ORGANIZATION> KIRO-TV </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION>, showed <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> leading by 46-39 percent with the rest undecided. In the poll, which had a 4.8 point margin of error, 46 percent favored the initiative, 32 percent were opposed and the rest undecided. Many observers believe the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> did Rice a favor by refusing to strike the initiative from the ballot. Opponents claimed the initiative violated the state Constitution, but the court decided to hear that claim only if the measure were passed. As a result, the overwhelmingly Democratic electorate can reject busing while voting for <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> sees crime as the top issue. <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> says the schools are tops in his campaign but he accuses the news media of downplaying his positions on crime, growth and other issues. <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> helped draft the measure and has been its leading advocate. City council and school board members generally are opposed. So is <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, who says the plan is racist in effect if not in intent. He rejects suggestions that <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> is racially biased. On Oct. 9, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> announced his own plan for assuring racial balance in schools with magnet programs, stronger city support for education and incentives for housing integration. The plan would eliminate any need for mandatory busing within four years, he said. <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> promptly accused his opponent of a near-flip-flop to woo voters. `` The political issue is that of leadership,'' he said. `` They've watched <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> go from adamant opposition to ending mandatory busing to embracing it.' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> admits a considerable change of heart `` because of what busing does to working families'' but said that if nothing else keeps the schools racially balanced, mandatory measures must continue. `` I still think that integrated, quality education is important to the future of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 Chinese police arrested four leaders of a dissident group that was active in the pro-democracy movement and worked to set up an underground armed force, an official Chinese report said today. The report indicates <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities are continuing the crackdown on people involved in the protests that swept the nation last spring. The `` <ORGANIZATION> Chongqing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'' in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province of southwestern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was formed May 21 after martial law was declared in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a report appearing in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Police arrested the group's leader, <PERSON> Dai </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiping </PERSON>, and three other key members, the news service said. The brief report did not say when the arrests were made. The report from <LOCATION> Chongqing </LOCATION> called the organization a `` counterrevolutionary group,'' a label that Chinese officials have been using for the pro-democracy protests. The news service said league members participated in illegal marches supporting the student-led protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, gave reactionary speeches, and incited turmoil. After Chinese troops crushed the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 4, the league remained active by calling secret meetings and scheming to steal guns to set up an underground fighting force, the report said. Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed during the military's June assault in the capital Today's report also claimed that the league tried to get foreign support, but did not elaborate. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, an English-language newspaper in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, quoted unidentified analysts in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> as saying they believed the league was an organization of workers, including the unemployed. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> annnounced thousands of arrests at the beginning of the crackdown. However, few arrests have been publicized recently, probably reflecting in part government sensitivity over foreign criticism.

 The dollar rose against most major foreign currencies in early European trading today. Gold prices rose as much as $ 4.25 an ounce. Currency dealers said trading was calm, and the market's attention had shifted to cross-currency trading They said the dollar moved up from its lows of late Friday on short-covering, but that interest in dollar trading was minimal. `` It's very quiet so far this morning,'' said one trader in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. `` I do n't see much space for the dollar to decline.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have agreed to expand joint efforts to resolve the cases of about 1,700 American soldiers missing from the Vietnam War, an official report said today. The agreement was reached after two days of talks in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential envoy <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON>, said the official <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> radio. It quoted a joint communique as saying the two sides agreed `` to refine and extend the process of joint cooperation to resolve the compelling cases of discrepancies, including conducting additional research to determine the fate of these Americans.'' `` Discrepancy cases'' are those to which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has assigned highest priority. They are cases it says the Vietnamese should have information on, including instances where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airmen are believed to have parachuted to safety but were never heard from. The broadcast did not give details of how the efforts would be expanded. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese specialists are now halfway into their eighth joint field investigation. These have involved such work as interviewing villagers living near sites where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes crashed. The war ended in 1975 with the defeat of the south by the Communist north. The communique said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side expressed appreciation for progress on programs to resettle Vietnamese in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including half-American children and former inmates of political `` re-education camps.'' `` Both sides agreed to continue efforts to sustain the current high level of cooperation on these important programs,'' it said. It said <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> repeated a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to encourage the efforts by non-governmental <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organizations to help <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with its humanitarian problems, including those involving disabled people and children. In previous talks, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to discuss non-humanitarian questions. However, the communique said <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> also exchanged views on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, where a Vietnamese-installed government is fighting guerrillas supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> with senior state and <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> officials and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, the head of the private <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisioners </ORGANIZATION> And Missing In <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. It was his second mission to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as presidential envoy. His August 1987 trip resulted in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s agreement to speed up work on humanitarian issues and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> promise to encourage non-governmental aid to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The Vietnamese seek American diplomatic recognition to end their isolation from the non-Communist world and bring in badly needed economic assistance. They have complained that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has failed to move in that direction since <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in late September withdrew what it called its last 26,000 troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had called the action a prerequisite for establishing relations. However, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is now demanding that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> work toward reaching a political settlement to the war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

 Anti-abortion activists accused their foes of manipulating public opinion and their pro-choice counterparts urged legislators to guard a woman's right to end a pregnancy during weekend rallies that drew thousands. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 anti-abortion activists rallied and then marched to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION> on Saturday. A day later, a crowd estimated by police at between 10,000 and 15,000 marched past the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> to Bicentennial Park to rally in favor of legal abortion. Both events were peaceful and no arrests were made. On Saturday, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, blasted the opposition, saying a reported upswing in support of the pro-choice movement was manufactured by well-financed interests. `` Is it true there is a major pro-abortion tide? It sure does n't look like it,'' he said `` There is a campaign around the country, with a lot of money, and they're saying that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is changing its opinion on the abortion issue.'' <PERSON> Willke </PERSON> also questioned polls and surveys on the abortion issue, calling them misleading. He cited a recent survey in which he said 67 percent of those polled said they felt women should have the right to an abortion. But he said 69 percent of the respondents, in response to a later question in the same poll, also said the lives of unborn babies should be protected. On Sunday, Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for Woman President <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, led the pro-choice march carrying a banner that said, `` Keep choice in your house, not the Statehouse.'' `` I call upon our heavenly mother to forgive our opponents who know not what they do,'' Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> told rally participants. `` Last night, we all turned out clocks back one hour ... but we must not turn our clocks back one generation,'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> told the crowd.

<HEAD>Official: Flight 103 Bomb May Have Malta, Libyan Links</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators suspect a bomb that destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 and killed 270 people may have originated in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> and that a Libyan may have been involved, a West German official said today. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> first reported that the bomb came from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, an island nation that has enjoyed good relations with the government of radical <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. The report said the bomb was transferred from a <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> flight to Flight 103 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> inside a suitcase unaccompanied by a passenger. The newspaper, which quoted airline personnel in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, also reported Sunday that the suitcase carried clothing purchased in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. It said investigators had traced the clothing to a store where the shopkeeper remembered that a man he believed was Libyan had bought them. Today, a spokesman for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s federal criminal investigations office in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> confirmed the Maltese link and said it was providing `` a hot trail'' for investigators. The Scottish detectives who are heading the investigation have contended for several months that the bomb was put on the jet in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where Flight 103 originated. Passengers and luggage were transferred to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. All 259 people aboard and 11 residents on the ground were killed when the bomb ripped apart the jet over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21. `` There are clues that a suitcase from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> may have played a part,'' said <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fundermann </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal investigations office. `` There are also clues that someone from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> _ or at least someone with a Libyan accent _ may have bought the items -LRB- of clothing -RRB-. Whether he also is the one who brought it -LRB- the suitcase -RRB- on board is still not known at this time,'' <PERSON> Fundermann </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Scottish authorities have declined comment on any <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> connection. No one has been charged in the bombing. There has long been speculation that a group of Palestinians arrested in October in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> may have been behind the attack, but <PERSON> Fundermann </PERSON> said there was no proof of that. He said the initial clue about a <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> connection came from an `` examination of the remains'' from the crash site. He did not elaborate. The Sunday Times said the evidence was in a computer list of all luggage put aboard Flight 103 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Two More Bodies Found In Wreckage Of Plastics Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rescuers located two more bodies in the massive steel and concrete debris of the <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plastics plant early today, while the search continued for six workers still missing. `` They were found in the area of the control room and the finishing room,'' company spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` That's really where we expect to find the rest of the missing. But we're talking about an area as big as a football field, so there's still quite a lot of area to get through.'' In the week since the plastics plant was ripped apart by a series of explosions, 16 bodies have been recovered by crews working around the clock. Only five bodies have been officially identified. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said the storm that dumped hail and up to 4 inches of rain around <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Sunday helped rescue efforts by damping dust from the rubble. `` The rain did n't really slow them down yesterday,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said today. `` It kept the dust down and the asbestos that is being cleaned up and removed from the area from flying around. From what I hear, we may get more rain today, so that could be good.'' But the crews' search was hampered Sunday by a steel beam which was hanging loosely 150 feet over a control room area where rescuers believe they will find the missing bodies. Workers used a crane to stabilize the beam. In addition to the two bodies found today, searchers working over the weekend found six bodies Saturday and another on Sunday. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesmen said 124 people were injured in the accident and nine remained hospitalized late Sunday. The polyethylene plant produced almost 20 percent of the nation's production of plastic pellets used in the manufacture of milk jugs and grocery bags. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> officials believe flammable hydrocarbon vapor from ethylene and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking chemical reactor, triggering Monday's blast. But they have said they do n't know how the gases were ignited

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new communist leader will travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> within the next two days for talks with <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> officials on political reform, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sources said Monday. Activists in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, where 300,000 people marched one week ago in the largest such demonstration in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 40-year history, said protesters would take to the streets again today to up keep pressure for democratic reform. Demands for reform have reached a fevered pitch this month and the government sponsored town meetings across the nation Sunday to discuss change. At least 20,000 people attended the rally in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and many jeered local officials and demanded explanations for misdeeds and blunders. Party sources said <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> would meet with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to discuss the course of reform talks now under way in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> would go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Tuesday. Meanwhile, a leader of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> charged that the nation's `` political structure no longer corresponded to the will of the people.'' <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogisch </PERSON> suggested in a commentary in his party's newspaper, <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgen </PERSON>, that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leading role would have to be won, not dictated Although <PERSON> Bogisch </PERSON> reiterated that socialism was not at issue in the reform debate, he said the communist leadership's policies are ` now a matter of debate.'' `` Those who were responsible for the stagnation will have to take responsibility for it,'' he said. The Liberal Democrats have been at the forefront of efforts to create more political pluralism within <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s socialist system. Under East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s constitution, all political parties are aligned with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Liberal Democrats have said the parties should have more independence. East Germans have taken to the streets by the hundreds of thousands this month to demand a more open society with free elections, a free press and an end to one-party rule. Since mid-September, more than 50,000 have fled to the West, many of them young skilled workers. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> today described weekend's rallies and protests as `` passionate and open, pugnacious and constructive'' and made no effort to discourage future demonstrations that have been drawing thousands to the streets each night. But it also declared that recent events stem from advances in socialism. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has promised `` a new course'' for the country, including freer travel to the West and an amnesty for people jailed for trying to escape what has been a tightly-controlled society. Sunday's meeting in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> quickly turned into an emotional forum, with speakers criticizing privileges accorded Communist officials. They also accused police of brutality against peaceful pro-democracy protesters earlier this month. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> party chief and a member of the country's ruling Politburo, drew applause when he announced his support for `` approved and well-ordered'' demonstrations in the city. Since <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> took power Oct. 18 officials have launched an unparalleled campaign of dialogue and openness aimed at winning public trust. Many activists are skeptical, however, saying <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders are only interested in reforms that do not challenge their monopoly on power. Communist officials in recent days have appealed to protesters to attend government-organized dialogue sessions rather than take to the streets. A member of the country's largest opposition group, New Forum, was quoted in an interview with a West German newspaper Sunday as saying street protests will continue as long as the government refuses to recognize opposition groups.

 A federal grand jury investigating former lobbyist <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> has heard testimony about late-night White House tours, missing presidential china and <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s interest in a secret military counterterrorism unit, according to a published report. The witness, who requested anonymity, described interviews last Thursday with Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents and the grand jury in a story in today's editions of The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> also has been subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury but apparently has not yet appeared, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION>'s Office is investigating <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s alleged connection to a male prostitution ring that was raided by <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents in February. The raid uncovered credit card receipts indicating the ring brought in as much as $ 20,000 a month. The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also is investigating allegations that two uniformed White House guards allowed <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> to take several prostitutes on after-hours tours of the executive mansion. One guard reportedly has acknowledged receiving an expensive watch from <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> and giving the lobbyist a piece of White House china. `` They pulled out a picture book containing the White House china collections and asked me about the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> china,'' the witness, identified as among those who took an unauthorized tour of the White House on July 3, 1988, told the Times. `` They wanted to know if I had seen anything like that. They strongly intimated that more things were missing.'' Federal prosecutors asked the most detailed questions about the tour, the witness was quoted as saying. The prosecutor also appeared to be investigating the use of credit cards to procure prostitutes and trying to determine the identity of a young man <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> had frequently introduced as his son, the witness said. According to the Times, <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> also asked the witness about <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s reported gift of an $ 8,000 Rolex watch to a member of the armed services, whom <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> pressed for information on the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, N.C.-based counterterrorism unit. `` They asked me what I thought <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> wanted to know about the Delta project,'' the newspaper quoted the witness as saying. `` I said it could mean he was just interested in the young guys there or something else.''

 Authorities say an arsonist may be responsible for a fire that damaged the home of the missing parents of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, the physician who was jailed for hiding her daughter in a child visitation battle. No one was in the house when the fire began early Sunday and there were no injuries, but the fire caused $ 50,000 damage to the suburban <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, home, said county Fire Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiger </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Weiger </PERSON> said today that investigators were trying to pin down the cause. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s brother, said he believed the fire was set deliberately. `` The way -LRB- investigators -RRB- told it to us is that arson is the only reason that makes sense, but they ca n't say it was arson unless there's no doubt,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. `` The report says that the point of origin was outside the house. It was not the wiring or anything that did it and it was in the middle of the night,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Weiger </PERSON> said she had no more information on the cause of the fire. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said the home has not been occupied since <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was sent to jail more than two years ago for refusing to produce her daughter, <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>, for court-ordered visits with the girl's father. Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, 42, alleges her ex-husband, oral surgeon <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, sexually molested the girl. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, 46, denies the charge and a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> judge has granted him visitation rights. Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> spent more than two years in jail and was released last month after widespread publicity led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a bill that ended her imprisonment. But the Morgan parents have not been seen since the summer of 1987 and the girl, who is 7 years old, remains missing. Asked in a telephone interview whether his parents knew of the fire and where they were, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said, `` I prefer not to say.''

 Police said today they were investigating for possible prosecution participants in a rally by 70,000 people in which the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' guerrilla campaign was repeatedly praised `` All that was said and all that took place is being studied,'' said police spokesman Col. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> the morning after the welcome rally for seven recently freed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders in a soccer stadium outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Nearly everything about the gathering violated security laws, but police kept their distance and state television led the evening news with a report on what was the largest anti-government rally in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 79-year history. Newspapers, including pro-government media, today called on the government to do away with laws restricting political activity. And the goverment hinted it may be considering lifting some restrictions on political expression to allow peaceful protests. `` We must be prepared to run risks,'' Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said on government-run television Sunday night, adding that maintaining the status quo is riskier than allowing mass protests. But <PERSON> Andries </PERSON> <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON>, head of the pro-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, called for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to meet immediately to discuss the direction the government was taking. `` The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, under its own flag and that of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> alongside, is enjoying complete freedom to propagate its aims and ambitions and issues one ultimatum after the other to the government,'' <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON> said. `` So-called peace protests are escalating and are accepted by the government as legal utterances of grievances,'' he said. The government granted permission for Sunday's rally as part of an attempt by new President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to promote black-white negotiations. But a magistrate had warned organizers that speakers should avoid promoting <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> aims. `` We refused,'' said <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramaphosa </PERSON>, a union leader and one of the main rally organizers. `` The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> lives. It is amongst us.'' `` Today, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has captured center stage in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' declared <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, 77, the group's former general secretary, in the main address Sunday to the cheering, singing, dancing throng which filled most of the seats in the recently opened stadium. Police and soldiers set up roadblocks nearby and searched vehicles, but few security force personnel were visible at the stadium itself. From a podium erected beneath huge banners of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and the South African <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> appeared with six <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> colleagues freed unconditionally from prison Oct. 15. All but one had spent at least 25 years in prison. Deafening cheers arose when <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and his colleagues slowly circled the playing field, each walking under an umbrella, behind an honor guard of 20 young militants, clad in khaki uniforms and marching in military style. `` <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>,'' shouted the crowd, many dressed in the movement's green, black and gold colors, or wearing T-shirts with the slogan, `` <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lives </ORGANIZATION>'' and the names of the freed prisoners The crowd included white South Africans and diplomats from at least 15 countries. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said his movement would never abandon its guerrilla campaign unilaterally. But, repeating previous offers, he said it would consider suspending violence and entering talks if the government frees all political prisoners, legalizes the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and lifts the 40-month-old state of emergency. `` To date, we see no clear indication that the government is serious about negotiation,'' said <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, who urged intensified economic sanctions. `` All the utterances are vague.'' The crowed roared when prominent activist <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> read a letter of greeting from <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>, the exiled president of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, who may not legally be quoted in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` This is a joyful day for all of us,'' said the message. `` We meet to celebrate a victory that belongs to all the people of our country.'' <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> directed part of his remarks at South African whites who seek to maintain apartheid, which denies the nation's 28 million blacks a voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate schools, districts and health services. `` They are part of our heritage,'' <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>'s message said. `` In the end, they too must learn to celebrate freedom and not oppression.'' If the government tries to perpetuate minority rule, said <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>, blacks will win their stuggle through confrontation. In addition to the seven <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders freed Oct. 15, the rally also honored <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, released from prison in November 1987. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> and four of the other men were sentenced to life imprisonment at a 1964 treason trial along with <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s best-known leader, who remains jailed. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, who earlier this year was at odds with prominent anti-apartheid leaders, was introduced over the public address system and had a seat of honor on the podium. State television showed footage of the crowd and paraphrased some of <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>'s remarks but did not broadcast any excerpts of the speeches. The rally went ahead despite anonymous threats that white extremists would shoot at black spectators. There were no serious disturbances. Scores of buses brought blacks from communities across the country. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has been outlawed since 1960, a year before it began a sabotage and bombing campaign. It was founded in 1912 and spent its first five decades using non-violent tactics to seek rights for blacks. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who assumed power in mid-August, has offered to negotiate a new constitution within five years that would extend political rights to blacks but protect white interests. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> wants a constitution that would establish a one-person, one-vote system.

<HEAD>Court Bars Lawsuit Against Christian Science Church in Michigan Death</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today barred a lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> church </ORGANIZATION> in the death of a 15-month-old <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> boy who died of meningitis. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that a suit against the church and its members over faith healing would violate their religious freedom. The case stems from the death of <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Swan </PERSON> on July 7, 1977, from brain abscesses caused by meningitis. His parents, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Swan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Grosse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pointe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, were lifelong adherents of Christian Science at the time of their son's death. They were advised by two <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> healers, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Laitner </PERSON> and <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearn </PERSON>, to rely on religious faith when <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> developed a raging fever about three weeks before he died. After their son's death, the Swans sued the two healers and the church, alleging negligence. The suit said, among other things, that the healers made inaccurate diagnoses and coerced the parents to forgo seeking medical help. The church was accused of negligence for failing to train the healers properly. A <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state judge threw out the suit, and the dismissal was upheld by a state appeals court in 1986. By that time, the Swans had withdrawn from the case and were replaced as plaintiffs by a representative of their child's estate. The appeals court said constitutionally protected yreligious freedom outweighs, in this case, the state's interest in protecting children. `` Religious conduct is permissible and protected unless the state can show a compelling state interest in interfering with the conduct,'' the state court said. `` Even then, the state must act in the least restrictive manner. We find no merit in -LRB- the -RRB- argument that ... -LRB- a negligence suit -RRB- is the least restrictive means of regulating spiritual healing practices.'' Lawyers representing <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Swan </PERSON>'s estate said the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> ruling conflicts with others that have allowed churches and their officials to be sued. For example, they cited a suit against the Rev. <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> by two former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> members who say they were duped into joining it The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last May refused to block that suit, rejecting an appeal by the <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The justices in the past have declined to review cases of alleged clergy malpractice and those in which faith healing practices are at issue. The case is <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Laitner </PERSON>, 89-354.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today turned away a dispute over how to apply federal anti-bias laws to foreign-owned businesses operating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The court, over one dissenting vote, let stand a ruling challenged both by <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> man replaced in his <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> job by a Korean citizen. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacNamara </PERSON> was fired in 1982 as <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION>'s Philadelphia-based district sales manager for <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> He was replaced by <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, who is in this country on a visa. <PERSON> MacNamara </PERSON> said the airline violated that portion of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banning discrimination based on race or national origin. <PERSON> MacNamara </PERSON>, 57 when he was fired, also said <PERSON> KAL </PERSON> violated a federal law against age bias. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> was 42 in 1982. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, in its ruling last December, gave partial victories to both <PERSON> MacNamara </PERSON> and KAL. The appeals court ordered that <PERSON> MacNamara </PERSON>'s lawsuit go to trial, but said he could prevail only if proving KAL intentionally discriminated against him based on some illegal criterion. The appeals court said that to win, <PERSON> MacNamara </PERSON> must prove that <PERSON> KAL </PERSON> would not have fired him but for his race, national origin or age. <PERSON> MacNamara </PERSON> can not succeed by showing, primarily with statistical evidence, that his firing had the effect of discriminating against older white Americans, the appeals court said. The 3rd Circuit court rejected <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION>'s argument that it should be shielded from all bias suits because of a 1956 Treaty of Friendship, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and Navigation between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The treaty gives businesses of each nation broad discretion in hiring on foreign soil. The appeals court said the treaty's `` limited purpose'' is to assure foreign investors `` the freedom to place their own citizens in key management positions, thus facilitating their operational success in the host country.'' The treaty does not authorize `` a broad exemption from laws that prohibit discrimination on grounds unrelated to citizenship,'' the appeals court said. <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the ruling will discourage foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and American investment abroad. <PERSON> MacNamara </PERSON> said the decision gives foreign corporations greater rights than those of domestic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations and exposes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers to discrimination. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reject the competing appeals. The cases are KAL vs. <PERSON> MacNamara </PERSON>, 88-1449, and <PERSON> MacNamara </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1551.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact $4.25 Million Award to Navy Divers' Families</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today left intact a $ 4.25 million award to the families of five <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers killed in an accident aboard the submarine USS Grayback in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> seven years ago. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, designer of the diving chamber in which the men died. The accident occurred near <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> the night of Jan. 16, 1982, when the divers were trapped inside the diving chamber without adequate air. A ventilation valve that allows air to enter the flooded chamber was not fully open, creating a vacuum as the water drained. The victims were <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cassopolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bremerton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Middleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitz </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Hixson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Goldsboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The Grayback, originally a missile-carrying sub, was converted in the late 1960s to dispatch divers underwater. General Dynamics designed the diving chamber, which then was built by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Court records said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was aware of a problem with the ventilation valve. It was difficult to turn and there were no warning devices to tell the divers it was not open completely. But the sub operated safely for 13 years as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, rather than redesigning the system, chose to compensate for the problem by training divers to cope. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 4.25 million to the victims' families. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was not ordered to pay any money. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the damage judgment in February. The appeals court, interpreting a key 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, refused to shield General Dynamics from the award. The high court last year ruled that a military contractor is protected from being sued when the government approves equipment conforming to `` reasonably precise'' Pentagon specifications and the company warns the government about any potential dangers of which it is aware. The 5th Circuit court said that ruling does not protect <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> because the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, in effect, rubber-stamped the contractor's design plans. Thus, the appeals court said, it was the company rather than the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> that exercised discretion over the chamber's design. `` The government does not exercise a discretionary function by merely approving the contractor's work,'' the appeals court said. `` If the government delegates its design discretion to the contractor and allows the contractor to develop the design, the government contractor defense -LRB- against being sued -RRB- does not apply.'' Major military contractors and business groups joined <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> in urging the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the 5th Circuit court ruling. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said the appeals court ruling undermines the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision and could discourage companies from competing for military contracts. The case is <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON>, 89-376.

<TEXT>
 A retired Marine lieutenant colonel who worked for former Sen. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jepsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> bid today to revive a libel lawsuit against Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, and two others. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON>'s suit. <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON>, while still an active-duty <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, was assigned to <PERSON> Jepsen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office staff in 1983. The arrangement was a controversial one, with <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON> continuing to be paid his $ 45,000 annual salary by the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member at the time who ran against and defeated <PERSON> Jepsen </PERSON> a in a 1984 Senate race, criticized his Republican opponent's appointment of <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> distributed a statement to the news media that said <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON> helped raise funds for <PERSON> Jepsen </PERSON>'s campaign. The statement disputed <PERSON> Jepsen </PERSON>'s claim that <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON> was hired to help procure defense contracts for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> businesses. <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON> retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 to become a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist for defense contractor <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In 1986 he sued <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>; <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, the senator's press secretary; and <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frew </PERSON>. <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON> said the 1984 news release was libelous because it implied he solicited funds for <PERSON> Jepsen </PERSON> in violation of federal law. <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jepsen </PERSON> denied that the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> solicited campaign funds. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last May upheld a federal judge's decision to throw out <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON>'s suit. The appeals court said <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>'s campaign press release was opinion, not fact. `` A campaign press release is not a research monograph,'' the appeals court said. `` Such a release is at least as likely to signal political opinion as a newspaper editorial or political cartoon.'' Only factual statements, not opinions, may be the basis of a libel suit, the appeals court said. Also, the appeals court said, <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON> failed to prove actual malice _ that the statements in the news release were made with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity. <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON> said <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> and his staff aides failed to investigate before alleging the officer Marine was raising funds for <PERSON> Jepsen </PERSON>. But the appeals court said such a lack of investigation is not `` evidence of reckless disregard for the truth.'' The case is <PERSON> Secrist </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, 89-220.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand rulings that may allow <LOCATION> Urbana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, officials to ban as obscene five `` adult'' magazines generally not considered hard-core pornography. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by store owners who said their free-speech rights were violated by the ban. Store owners <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Downing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Veneroni </PERSON> said the magazines are known in the publications industry as `` adult sophisticate'' magazines, similar to <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> and Penthouse. `` Magazines of this genre generally contain erotic photographs of a woman or a man or couples in various poses, often fully nude, but avoid explicit depictions of sexual activity,'' the store owners said. The magazines are Nuggets, Velvet, Juggs, Oui and Big Boobs. Copies were puchased by <LOCATION> Urbana </LOCATION> Law Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON> on Nov. 25, 1985, at the Main News and Smoke Shop run by Downing and <LOCATION> Veneroni </LOCATION>. A municipal judge ruled that the magazines are obscene, opening the way for city officials to ban their sale in <LOCATION> Urbana </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, by a 5-2 vote, upheld the ruling in May. `` Courts are not bound by the magazine industry's determination of what is explicit,'' the state court said. `` All five magazines contain either in the text, photographs or their advertisements numerous depictions or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts. -LRB- They -RRB- are legally obscene under <LOCATION> Urbana </LOCATION> ordinances.'' For example, the state court said, there are ads in the magazines showing sexual activity in which small black dots were used to obscure sexual organs. The dots would `` not preclude a jury from finding'' the pictures are obscene, the state court said. The store owners said the ban violates a 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that says material is obscene if the average person using contemporary community standards finds it appeals to prurient interests and depicts sexual acts in a patently offensive manner. That ruling said the work must be judged as a whole, and must be found to lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. The case is Downing vs. <LOCATION> Urbana </LOCATION>, 89-298.

 Police arrested 169 young curfew violators on the first night of a three-day campaign against Devil's Night arson, a spokesman said today. Tens of thousands of citizen volunteers helped patrol streets Sunday in efforts to reduce the number of arson fires stemming from the traditional Halloween-time spree. City officials did not release information today on the number of fires reported Sunday night and this morning. For three nights beginning Sunday, those under 18 face arrest if they are out without an adult between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Those age 17 are being charged with misdemeanor curfew violation, while younger people are being released to the custody of a parent or guardian. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, who released the arrest totals this morning, said he did not know how many of the 169 arrested were age 17. Devil's Night drew national attention in 1984 when 810 fires were set in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Since then, the number of fires has declined each Devil's Night period. There were 229 fires reported during the three-day period last year, an average of 76 per night. About 65 fires are reported on a normal night in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, fire officials say. An estimated 30,000 citizen volunteers were helping patrol streets on Sunday, authorities said. Several fires in garages were reported Sunday night in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s lower east side One abandoned home was set on fire twice in a 90-minute period. The second time it burned down and the fire spread to an occupied home, according to radio station WWJ-AM. No injuries were reported in any of the fires. Police said they found explosives in a vacant home's garage on <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s northeast side Sunday night, but were n't sure if it was connected with Devil's Night activity. Seven cases of dynamite, six blasting caps and 200 feet of time fuse were found, said <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavens </PERSON>. No arrests were made and it is unknown when the explosives were placed in the garage. The police bomb squad successfully disposed of the dynamite, Leavens said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to hear appeals by three drug manufacturers fighting lawsuits over the effects of DES, a drug once used by pregnant women to prevent miscarriages. The court, without comment, left intact a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ruling aimed at forcing all manufacturers of the drug to share in paying damages for injuries allegedly caused by DES. DES, the common name for the synthetic female hormone diethylstilbestrol, was made and sold by some 300 phramaceutical companies from 1947 until 1971. Up to 3 million women used it to help prevent miscarriages. But in 1970 researchers discovered a connection between DES and cancer in the daughters of women who used the drug. There was evidence the cancer often did not develop until the daughter of the DES user was from 15 to 25 years old. In the cases acted on today, E.R. <ORGANIZATION> Squibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons, <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rexall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> challenged a ruling last April by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The state court said it is generally impossible to identify the manufacturer of the DES ingested in any particular case. Druggists usually filled prescriptions from whatever was on hand _ and one brand of DES pretty much resembled the next, the state court said. Also, it said, because years or decades passed before the cancer developed, it is practically impossible to trace the producer of DES in any particular case. The state court rejected manufacturers' claims that they should not be held liable for potentially millions of dollars in damages when there is no proof they made the drug that caused any injury. But, the appeals court said: `` It would be inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of a modern society to say to these -LRB- women -RRB- that because of the insidious nature of an injury that long remains dormant, and because so many manufacturers, each behind a curtain, contributed to the devastation, the cost of injury should be borne by the innocent and not the wrongdoers.'' The state court said damage awards against each company should be paid based on its percentage of national DES sales. This so-called market theory corresponds `` to the overall culpability of each defendant, measured by the amount of risk of injury each defendant created to the public at large,'' the state court said. That court also upheld a 1986 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law that suspended the deadline for filing damage claims allegedly caused by DES. The law permitted suits to be filed for one year, regardless of when the injury occurred. Because of the latent nature of DES injuries, `` we believe that ... an injustice has been rectified'' by creating the one-year window, the state court said. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Rexall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Tigue </PERSON>, 89-168; E.R. <ORGANIZATION> Squibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons vs. <PERSON> Hymowitz </PERSON>, 89-204; <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Hymowitz </PERSON>, 89-397.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to make it easier for police pursuing people suspected of minor crimes to enter their homes without court warrants. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that a <LOCATION> Moorestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, man accused of numerous motor vehicle offenses was arrested unlawfully in his home two years ago. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON> was arrested at his home in the predawn hours of April 6, 1987. Police officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Liss </PERSON> had followed a car he noticed swerving on and off the road. He tried to pull the car over by activating his squad car's lights and siren. The swerving car ignored the officer's signals and made four loops through a residential neighborhood before pulling into a private driveway and into a garage. <PERSON> Liss </PERSON> stopped his car in the driveway and ran into the garage. He told <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON> to stop, but <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON> entered the house. <PERSON> Liss </PERSON> followed him, telling <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON> that he was under arrest. When taken to a police station, <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON> refused to take a breathalyzer test. He was charged with reckless driving, driving while intoxicated, refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test, driving with an expired license, failure to maintain a single lane, eluding and resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct. <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON> sought to have his refusal to submit to a breath test thrown out as trial evidence, claiming that it was based on an unlawful arrest. A trial judge turned down <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON>'s request, but a state appeals court and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the evidence must be suppressed. The state's highest court ruled that <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON>'s warrantless arrest in his home amounted to an unreasonable police seizure banned by the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. In the appeal acted on today, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Perretti </PERSON> relied on previous rulings in which the justices allowed such warrantless arrests in cases of `` hot pursuit'' by police of criminal suspects. But the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> court said the hot-pursuit exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement `` has been interpreted to apply only to the pursuit of fleeing felons'' _ not people suspected of relatively minor crimes, or misdemeanors. The case is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON>, 89-417.

<HEAD>Court Orders Further Study in Alabama Racial Bias Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ordered further study in a lawsuit that's been in federal court for 18 years, in which black workers allege racial bias at a railroad freight car plant in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The justices, in a brief order, said the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> should restudy the case in light of three of their recent civil rights rulings. In one key decision last summer, the justices made it harder to win on-the-job bias cases by using statistics to show racial disparities in an employer's workforce. The <LOCATION> Bessemer </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, plant was at one time the world's largest for building railroad freight cars. It employed 2,000 in 28 departments before being shut down in 1981. The appeals acted on today stem from a 1971 lawsuit accusing Pullman-Standard and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> union of agreeing to a contract that discriminated against blacks in hiring, training, temporary assignments, promotions and in the company's seniority system. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 overturned a federal appeals court ruling that the seniority system violated the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964. The justices said the appeals court exceeded its authority in determining the seniority system intentionally was biased. But the dispute was far from over. The high court left many questions unanswered, including whether blacks seeking damages proved the seniority rules had the effect of discriminating against them even if unintentional. After ensuing lower court hearings, the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last year handed down a lengthy ruling that in part favored the blacks and in part favored the company and the union. The appeals court said the workers proved the company's procedures for picking supervisors had a discriminatory impact against blacks The appeals court also said the seniority system was not created or maintained with discriminatory intent and that any discrimination in department assignments ended by February 1969. But the appeals court, overturning part of a trial judge's decision, said <PERSON> Pullman-Standard </PERSON> may be forced to pay damages for racially discriminatory department assignments before February 1969 <PERSON> Pullman-Standard </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to dismiss the suit. The company said the appeals court relied incorrectly on statistical evidence to show discriminatory effects. The company's lawyers also said the class-action suit on behalf of all black workers at the plant was defective because some employees who served as representatives of the class were ineligible to sue. The black workers asked the justices to revive their attack on the seniority system, and to make it easier to prove their claims and win damages. The cases are <PERSON> Pullman-Standard </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Swint </PERSON>, 88-1601, and <PERSON> Swint </PERSON> vs. Pullman-Standard, 88-1602.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by law enforcement officials who discovered marijuana growing on a <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> couple's heavily wooded property. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that officers violated the couple's privacy rights when they entered the grounds without a search warrant. The appeal stems from a search by officers from the <ORGANIZATION> Kennebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION>'s 4.5-acre property in <LOCATION> Litchfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, on Aug. 19, 1987. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Magagnoli </PERSON> lived there with Wing. The officers, after getting a tip that marijuana was being grown in the area, flew over it in an airplane and spotted what they believed to be marijuana plants in a grassy clearing. Without a court warrant, they entered Wing's property using a driveway that splits into a Y about 100 feet from the road. The left leg of the driveway leads to Wing's home and the right ends at a grassy area where the officers said they discovered the marijuana. The grassy area turned out not to be the same clearing the officers observed from the airplane. That clearing was on a neighbor's property where marijuana also was growing. The officers got a warrant before seizing the marijuana plants and searching the home where Wing and Ms. <PERSON> Magagnoli </PERSON> lived. A state judge ruled the plants could not be used as evidence against the couple. The judge said Wing preserved the heavily wooded nature of the property to guard his privacy, in effect using trees as a substitute for a fence. The judge emphasized that Wing and Ms. <PERSON> Magagnoli </PERSON> said they sunbathed in the nude and made love in the grassy clearing. The couple reasonably expected their `` intimate activities'' there would be as private as if they took place in the home, the judge said. The ruling was upheld by a 3-3 vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last June. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> prosecutors said the judge's decision conflicts with a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that allowed police without a warrant to enter fenced-in _ but unwooded _ property and look into a barn located about 60 yards from a ranch house. The justices ruled in that case that the barn was not part of the homeowner's `` curtilage'' _ the area of land occupied by a dwelling, its yard and other nearby buildings that are protected against warrantless searches by the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. The high court in 1984 reaffirmed a long-standing legal doctrine that police may enter and search even fenced-in `` open fields'' without a court warrant. The case acted on today is <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> vs. Wing, 89-381.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a $ 1.5 million award won by the family of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employee who died of cancer after his exposure to a <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> herbicide. The justices, without comment, refused to hear a Dow appeal aimed at winning a new trial in the product-liability case. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON> in 1976-77 was seasonally employed by the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, primarily as a fire fighter. He also participated in a weed-control project in which he applied Dow herbicides, including dichlarophenoxyacetic acid or 2,4-D. <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON>'s exposure to 2,4-D ended in 1978 when he was transferred to another national park A year later, <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON> was diagnosed as suffering from <PERSON> Hodgkin </PERSON>'s disease. He died in 1986. <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, in 1979 but his lawsuit sat dormant for six years after wrongly being included in a series of suits over <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans' exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange. When <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON> died, his family replaced him as plaintiffs. A federal jury in <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, awarded the <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON> family $ 1.5 million in damages against Dow in 1987. At trial, a physician hired as an expert witness by the <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON> family testified that 2,4-D caused <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON>'s cancer. Among the doctor's medical records submitted in the case, those of another patient, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, mistakenly were included. When a Dow lawyer asked the doctor about <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, the doctor said he did not know any such person. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> said they learned after the <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON> trial that the doctor had known <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>. They said the `` newly discovered evidence'' entitled Dow to a new trial. But the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected that argument in upholding the award last April 4. The doctor's false testimony `` could not have affected the outcome of the trial,'' the appeals court said. `` The further revelation that -LRB- the doctor -RRB- had forgotten the name of one patient could not have affected the jury's verdict. Dow was not hurt by -LRB- the doctor's -RRB- confusion.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON>, 89-395.

 A Yugoslavian freighter ran aground in the westernmost <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> early today, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was the second such accident along the 200-mile stretch of islands within a week. The 475-foot container ship Mavro Vetranic grounded itself in the Dry Tortugas, a cluster of islands about 70 miles west of <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, at about 3:45 a.m. EST, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Another ship relayed a message on the grounding to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> at 7:50 a.m., said Petty Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter was n't expected to reach the ship until late morning. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> had very few details of the accident, but <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said there was no report of any spillage from the vessel's fuel tanks It was n't immediately known what type of cargo the <PERSON> Mavro </PERSON> <PERSON> Vetranic </PERSON> was carrying, if any, nor where the ship was headed, said <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON>. `` There is no visible pollution, there's no injuries at the moment, and the ship is hard aground,'' Petty Officer <PERSON> Alastair </PERSON> <PERSON> Worden </PERSON> said after a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter flew over the 16-year-old ship. The Dry Tortugas is the site of <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION> and is marked by a tall lighthouse as well as the massive fort, famed for its use as a Union prison during the Civil War. A boat from the monument was headed to the ship, which ran aground on the western edge of the Tortugas, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON>. `` The coral reefs will be the concern in this particular issue,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON> said. The grounding came five days after a much smaller cargo ship, the 155-foot <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maitland </PERSON>, ran aground in the <ORGANIZATION> Key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Largo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanctuary </ORGANIZATION>, about 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>.

 For the second time in four years, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> went to court today to face charges of defrauding the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and two employees were accused of cheating the Pentagon of $ 10 million. The company, the country's second-largest defense contractor, faces a fine of $ 71.9 million if convicted. Since the 321-count indictment was returned in November, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> consistently denied shortchanging the government in a $ 270 million contract to make a battlefield computer system. The company has acknowledged, however, that an internal investigation uncovered discrepancies totaling $ 3.69 million. GE refunded that money before the indictment was handed up in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Undercoffler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> attorney, said the trial is expected to last at least two months. According to the Pentagon, officials at a <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Techinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in suburban King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>, padded costs and failed to notify the Pentagon of savings negotiated with subcontractors. In May 1985, the company pleaded guilty to illegally claiming $ 800,000 in cost overruns on Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles and paid a $ 1.04 million fine. GE does approximately $ 6 billion annually in <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> business that ranges from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified strategic work. Jury selection began this morning in the case, which will scrutinize how <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> handled its billing. Accused with <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> were <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, the former subcontracts manager for MATSCO, and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON>, 51, of King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MATSCO </ORGANIZATION>'s materials manager. <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> were charged with racketeering, five counts of mail fraud, making false statements and concealing material facts from a federal agency. Both men are now working for GE in other departments. GE, which was charged with five acts of mail fraud and with making 312 false statements to the government, tried unsuccessfully to settle the case out of court. Last week, at a pre-trial hearing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the government sought internal company papers <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> has declined to provide on grounds they are privileged attorney-client communications.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to use a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> drug prosecution to consider expanding police search powers. The justices said they will hear arguments that police, acting without a warrant, should be allowed to use evidence seized after they were allowed into a man's apartment by his girlfriend. The defendant, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, was arrested on July 26, 1985, on charges he possessed cocaine and marijuana with intent to distribute the drugs. Police said the drugs and drug paraphernalia were in plain view at <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s apartment. <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who lived with <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> part-time, summoned police to her mother's home on July 26. She told them <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> had beaten her at the couple's apartment and she wanted to make a complaint. The police then accompanied her to <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s apartment and she opened the door with a key. She later testified that she took the key from <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s dresser after the two argued earlier that day. An <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> appeals court said police violated the defendant's rights because Ms. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> lacked authority to let the police into the apartment Police may not enter and search a home without a warrant `` if the party who consented to the entry had apparent authority to do so but lacked actual authority,'' the state appeals court said. The appeals court noted that Ms. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s name was not on the apartment lease and she did not help pay the rent. Also, the state court said, she was an infrequent visitor and did not have access to the apartment when <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was not there. She also had moved her clothes and children to her mother's home, the state court noted. `` All of these factors indicate that <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> did not have the common authority over the defendant's apartment that was necessary to make her consent to enter valid,'' the state court added. The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> attorney general's office, in appealing to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said police acted in good faith when they relied on Ms. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s `` apparent authority to permit entry into the home.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 ruled that when one occupant of a home consents to a search of the premises, evidence police find may be used against another occupant. The case is <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 88-2018.

 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to the ambassador's house was n't all lightness. About 20 American students staged a silent human rights protest at the back of the crowd inside the embassy. A few hundred embassy workers and other Americans had come to see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and the students said they had only to show their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship to get in. Dressed in black, they held up small signs, each bearing the name of a person from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and the word `` Disappeared,'' and `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> $'' The students also held up large sheet banners reading `` Shame,'' and `` Democracy: Social and political equality and respect for the individual. Look it up, <PERSON> George </PERSON>.'' The students said they were protesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to countries that still engage in human rights violations. It was not clear if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noticed them.

 Local security for the multinational conference was so rigid that even reporters, staying in hotels a few miles from the meeting site and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hotel, were kept under close guard. The press hotels were cleared of other guests and only those wearing press or staff credentials were allowed in the door. Throughout <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> was a show of armed force that was rare in the small country, the only nation in the region with no army. Police troops were called in from around the country to help provide security for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and the other heads of state. Armed officers were stationed along the major highway and on most of the bridges.

 National Guard troops resumed their search this morning in the woods and fields near the spot where an 11-year-old boy was abducted by a masked gunman eight days ago. About 225 National Guard troops and 80 <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> workers searched unsuccessfully Sunday for clues in the abduction of <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetterling </PERSON>, while supporters of the boy's family released more than 1,000 white balloons after a church service `` There's a lot of power here, a lot of hope. I've got to feel very hopeful,'' said the missing boy's mother, <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetterling </PERSON>. A highway into <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, a town of about 3,000 some 80 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, was blocked Sunday night as authorities stopped drivers to ask if they had been in the vicinity the evening of Oct. 22, when the boy was kidnapped. Those who had were shown three composite sketches of possible suspects. Authorities earlier had released one of the sketches, a picture of a man wearing glasses who is believed to have tried to kidnap a 10-year-old boy in <LOCATION> Stearns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> during the summer. The other two sketches will not be released to the public until authorities follow leads from Sunday night's roadblock questioning, an agent at the <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, described as a top student and hockey player, was abducted at gunpoint by a masked man on a dark stretch of road less than a mile from his home on the town's outskirts. The incident occurred as <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, his 10-year-old brother, <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON>, and an 11-year-old friend were returning from a convenience store about 9:30 p.m. The abductor asked the boys how old they were then held onto <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> and threatened to shoot the other two unless they ran away. The release of the helium-filled balloons, each labeled with the words `` <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>'s Hope,'' was another attempt by the town to sustain the search's momentum. `` I think they -LRB- the balloons -RRB- are sending out all our love all over the place and I do n't think there is a place that is going to be untouched by this,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wetterling </PERSON> said. A white sweat sock found Saturday near the kidnapping site was to be analyzed today at the state crime lab to determine if it is linked to the abduction, sheriff's officials said. `` There's been no additional finding of clues,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. The search stretched from dawn to dark each day over the weekend. <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> catcher <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbach </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> native, wore a `` J'' on the back of his batting helmet during the fourth game of the World Series in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on Saturday night to help focus nationwide attention on the search for <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to review a ruling government lawyers say threatens the federal program protecting the pensions of 30 million American workers. The justices said they will decide what authority the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, a federal agency, has to order employers to restore terminated pension plans. A federal appeals court limited such authority by setting aside the agency's order that <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, restore three pension plans with unfunded liabilities of $ 2.3 billion. The appeal acted on today said the ruling, if not overturned, could make the agency `` an open-ended source of industry bailouts'' and `` could lead to a financial crisis similar to that currently facing'' the government's insurance program for the savings and loan industry. In other action, the court: _ Turned away an appeal by a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> state agency that wants to test its employees for AIDS. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that blocked the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> from imposing mandatory blood testing of employees who come into direct contact with the mentally retarded people the agency serves. _ Agreed to use a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> drug prosecution to consider expanding police search powers. The justices said they will hear arguments that police, acting without a warrant, should be allowed to use evidence seized after they were allowed into a man's apartment by his girlfriend. _ Barred a lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> church </ORGANIZATION> in the death of a 15-month-old <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> boy who died of meningitis. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that a suit against the church and its members over faith healing would violate their religious freedom. _ Rejected an appeal by an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> member who says he should have as much right as an ordained minister to perform marriage ceremonies. The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law favoring ministers violates religious freedom and the constitutionally required separation of church and state. _ Refused to hear appeals by three drug manufacturers fighting lawsuits over the effects of DES, a drug once used by pregnant women to prevent miscarriages. The court, without comment, left intact a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ruling aimed at forcing all manufacturers of the drug to share in paying damages for injuries allegedly caused by DES. _ Turned away an appeal by a former <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> executiv e fighting his conviction for selling adulterated apple juice. The court, without comment, left intact <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>'s sentence of a year and a day in prison and a $ 100,000 fine _ Turned down an appeal by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who is serving a 99-year prison sentence for the assassination of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s rights were not violated 20 years ago when he pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. The <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, modeled after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is wholly owned by the federal government. Its board of directors is comprised of the secretaries of labor, treasury and commerce. The agency protects the pension benefits of the 30 million Americans who participate in single-employer defined benefit pension plans. When a pension plan is ended with insufficient money to satisfy promised benefits, the federal agency becomes the pension plan's trustee, taking over its assets and liabilities The agency then pays all benefits workers had earned as of the date the pension plan ended. In fiscal year 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 324.7 million in insured benefits to 113,000 retirees who participated in 1,476 terminated pension plans. The cost of the pension insurance is paid primarily by employers with active pension plans, and by employers who terminate underfunded pension plans. The agency has money problems of its own. In its most recent annual report, the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> listed liabilities of $ 4 billion and assets of $ 2.4 billion. The Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>, after filing for reorganization under federal bankruptcy law in 1986, advised the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> that they could not and would not fund the three pension plans they sponsored. The plans, which have about 100,000 participants, were terminated in 1987. In a deal with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> union, however, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to what government lawyers contend is a `` follow-on'' arrangement. Under it, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> agreed to make up any benefits lost to employees because of the pension plans' termination _ those benefits not covered by the federal pension insurance program The result: employees continued to receive the same benefits they did before the plans were terminated, and payment of unfunded pension liabilities was shifted to the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> was responsible for $ 75 million in annual supplemental retirement benefits, and the federal agency was making good on some $ 400 million in annual obligations to <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> pensioners. The <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> contends such arrangements are abusive, and the agency ordered <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> to reassume responsibility for the three pension plans. When <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> refused, the agency sought to enforce its order in federal court. A federal judge threw out the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>'s order for restoration of the pension plans, and the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld that ruling last May 12. Federal law `` reveals no indication that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended the establishment of successive benefit plans to be a ground for restoration,'' the appeals court ruled. It also said the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>'s action was `` arbitrary and capricious'' because it failed to consider the goals of federal bankruptcy and labor laws when issuing its restoration order. The <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> then sought <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, contending that the 2nd Circuit court's ruling `` places the pension insurance program in serious financial jeopardy'' and ignores what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> attempted to achieve in passing the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 -LRB- ERISA -RRB-. `` Other companies will follow <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s example and use pension insurance as a subsidy to reduce costs and gain a competitive edge,'' the appeal said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers sided with the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>, telling the high court, `` The <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> has reasonably concluded that restoration is an appropriate response to the adoption of abusive follow-on plans.'' They said the appeals court ruling `` threatens to undermine ... a program already seriously in debt.'' But lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` specifically rejected proposed prohibitions on follow-on plans'' when substantially amending ERISA in 1987. The case is <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, 89-390.

 The city district court today sentenced a Palestinian to 16 life terms for forcing a bus off a cliff, killing 16 people, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. The court gave <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> a life sentence for each of the passengers who died in the crash and 20-year sentences for each of the 24 passengers injured, said the state prosecutor, <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hasson </PERSON> said it was the stiffest sentence since the start of the 22-month Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> is ineligible for parole and can only be freed by a presidential pardon. `` It was a terrorist killing of 16 innocent people who were only trying to travel home safely. They were young, they were old, men, women. They found their deaths by the accused, but they did nothing wrong,'' <PERSON> Hasson </PERSON> said in an interview. The bus was en route to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> on July 6 when <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> grabbed the steering wheel and forced the bus into a deep ravine. The victims included an American woman and two Canadian tourists. <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON>, who also was injured in the incident, said he decided to carry out a suicide attack after soldiers shot and wounded his best friend in a clash near his home in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Nusseirat refugee camp. His friend was paralyzed as a result of the incident. At least 607 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the Palestinian revolt against the Israeli occupation. An addition 137 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most as suspected collaborators with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Forty Israelis have died. The latest victim was a 24-year-old Palestinian who died today of a gunshot wound suffered five days ago in the Farah refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army said. He was identified as <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassani </PERSON> and the army said he was about to throw a cement building block at soldiers when he was hit. News of <PERSON> Hassani </PERSON>'s death sparked demonstrations in the <PERSON> Farah </PERSON> camp, and the army imposed a curfew on the area. Two Palestinians were wounded, including a 17-year-old youth who was shot in the chest, the army said. In a stone-throwing clash with soldiers in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shabura </LOCATION> refugee camp, a 14-year-old Palestinian was critically wounded when he was hit in the head with a plastic bullet, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said The youth, identified as <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> <PERSON> Kishda </PERSON>, was taken to <LOCATION> Soroka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the reports said. A Canadian television correspondent was hit in the leg by a rubber-coated metal pellet fired by soldiers as he filmed the clash. He was identified as <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON> of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli newspapers reported that the army soon will begin deploying observation balloons equipped with cameras to pinpoint rioting related to the uprising The army spokesman's office declined comment on the reports, which said the unmanned balloons will be floated over refugee camps and other areas and transmit live photos to ground forces.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was urged today to strike down a federal judge's order doubling local property taxes to pay for school desegregation in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Calling the judge's 1987 order `` taxation without representation,'' an attorney for the state of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartow </PERSON> <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, argued that federal courts lack the power to order higher taxes even to correct a constitutional violation such as racial discrimination in schools. `` There is no power to tax, period,'' <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> told the justices in oral arguments. The state asked the high court to overturn a decision by the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that upheld the property tax increase ordered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. Lawyers for both sides spent perhaps a third of the 60-minute argument session answering questions by several of the justices about a possible procedural flaw that could preclude any constitutional ruling in the case. The school district and a group of school children, who brought the original desegregation case in 1977, urged the court to uphold the tax decision. The district also maintained that the state waited too long to file a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal, rendering it unnecessary for the justices to address the tax issue. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, an attorney for the district, contended that state property tax law and local voters must not be allowed to frustrate the constitutional rights of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s minority schoolchildren to an equal educational opportunity. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said it was `` dangerously wrong'' to assume that federal courts lack powers to implement their orders to correct constitutional violations. The courts, he said, `` have the powers and have the duty to use their equitable discretion'' to remedy such wrongs as racial segregation in schools. The court is expected to issue a decision in the case by next July. Legal scholars and education officials say the court's decision could shape future school desegregation plans across the country and define the federal courts' power to remedy constitutional violations involving issues from prison overcrowding to fair housing. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> ordered the tax increase in September 1987 after the local school district was unable to pay its share of a more than $ 400 million desegregation plan he had approved for capital improvements in buildings and establishment of special `` magnet'' schools. State law says local property taxes may be raised only with voters' approval, and in some instances only with a two-thirds majority. District voters had not approved a levy increase since 1969, with four tax increase proposals rejected in 1986 and 1987 to finance the desegregation plan. In addition to doubling the property tax, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> imposed an income tax surcharge on those people living or working in the school district. The appeals court struck down the income surcharge in August 1988, but upheld the district court's authority to order an increase in the property tax. However, the appeals court modified the procedure for imposing the higher tax levy. The appeals court found that state law had effectively prevented the school district from levying the necessary taxes to pay for the desegregation plan. It upheld <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s order as one that `` set aside levy limitations,'' and empowered the elected local school board to set the needed tax levels within certain limits.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Monday said it might cut oil exports by about 76,000 barrels a day in 1990 so the fuel could be used domestically.

The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> suffers erratic domestic gasoline shortages, and Soviet TV has shown farms unable to harvest grain for lack of fuel.

 Armed police will replace soldiers in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and troops have been withdrawn from intersections in a major scaling down of the capital's 5-month-old martial law, officials said Monday. The move appeared a test of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s stability before martial law is lifted completely, which a government spokesman recently said will happen `` before very long.'' Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> ordered martial law in most of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 20 as hundreds of thousands of students and citizens marched through the streets daily to demand democratic reform. The army ended the protests June 3-4 by shooting its way through the crowd to retake Tiananmen Square, the demonstrators' base. `` Since achieving a decisive victory in the struggle to quell the counterrevolutionary rebellion, the situation in the capital is moving daily toward stability and social order is basically normal,'' the city government and martial law command post said in an announcement on the local TV news. `` Therefore ... effective upon announcement of this order, martial law sentinels at overpasses and intersections will completely withdraw.'' As of Monday night, overpasses where soldiers had stood around the clock under brightly colored umbrellas were unguarded except for surveillance cameras on lampposts. The only soldiers in view in the city center were around the perimeter of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and at nearby intersections. Few military trucks were on the streets Monday night. On recent nights, convoys of hundreds of trucks of troops and supplies have been seen moving through the city, their destination unclear. The order said soldiers in Tiananmen Square will be replaced Tuesday by ordinary police and <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, a special security unit. It made clear, however, that martial law was not being lifted. `` Some soldiers stationed in the city and suburbs, together with police and <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, will continue in some districts to carry out their martial law duties,'' it said. `` We hope that all city residents will voluntarily respect martial law orders and regulations and actively uphold the capital's normal work, production, education, scientific research and social order.'' Martial law orders forbid marches, strikes, class boycotts, public speeches, distributing pamphlets, spreading rumors and other `` destructive activity.'' Large-scale resistance to martial law was crushed in the week after the June 3-4 army attack, and since then only isolated cases of civilians attacking soldiers have been reported. The government said many guns were stolen from army trucks during the troops' sometimes-bumbling entry into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and that martial law was necessary to protect social order Gunshots still ring out at night without any official explanation. The number of troops visible in the city has fallen sharply since midsummer, when at least 150,000 were stationed along main roads and in key facilities such as the television station and Great Hall of the People. Only several dozen now guard the perimeter of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, restricting access to what used to be a favorite recreation spot. They are armed with automatic rifles and wear helmets. Despite the reduction in troop presence, martial law has discouraged many tourists from returning, and Western diplomats have indicated that lifting martial law is a minimum requirement for their governments to lift sanctions imposed in June. Most Western governments have halted high-level contacts and military sales, and have opposed new low-interest loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by international institutions such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Government spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> said last week martial law was `` for a limited time and it seems that it will be lifted before very long.'' He refused to disclose a date.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is facing a musical talent shortage because top artists are leaving for foreign countries, an official daily said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said 470 musicians, mostly highly skilled professionals, have gone abroad at their own expense in the past decade.

Unlike writers, film directors and artists who have left <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for political reasons, most departing musicians are seeking to escape the restrictive atmosphere of being locked into one group or genre and live in a place where they have more freedom to express their musical talents.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a case likely to affect other multi-state agencies, agreed today to decide whether a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> transportation authority may be sued in federal court. The justices said they would hear arguments by the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> seeking to kill lawsuits by two employees. The authority was created in 1921 in a Congress-approved compact between the two states. It operates airports, trains linking <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and other transportation facilities. The authority is run by 12 commissioners, six each appointed by the governors of the respective states. The governors also have veto power over actions by the commissioners. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> ruled in April that <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> employees <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON> may sue the agency in federal court. The appeals court said the 11th Amendment to the Constitution shielding states from federal court suits does not apply to the interstate agency. The 2nd Circuit court said the authority may be sued for money damages largely because any judgment it would be forced to pay would come from its revenues rather than the taxpayer-supported treasuries of the two states. `` We believe that this insulation of state treasuries from the liabilities of the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> outweighs both the methods of -LRB- commisioner -RRB- appointment and gubernatorial veto,'' the appeals court said. The appeals court invited the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review the ruling, noting that the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> has issued a conflicting ruling on the authority's immunity from suit The 2nd Circuit court said the 3rd Circuit was in error in concluding that the taxpayers of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> could be forced to pay damages if a suit depleted the agency's resources. <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON> is seeking $ 3 million for injuries he suffered while working at a maintenance shop run by the authority in 1986.

<HEAD>Panel Recommends Two-Year Suspension of Embattled Priest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A socially active inner-city <PERSON> Episcopal </PERSON> priest who sued his diocese and its bishop lied when he accused them of conspiring to control his parish's money, a church panel concluded today. In the first ecclesiastical trial ever held in the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> diocese, the five priests on the panel unanimously recommended that the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> be suspended for two years from ministerial or administrative involvement in the church. Bishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spong </PERSON> must still approve the recommendation, and <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s attorney said he would appeal. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, who filed the lawsuit in 1988 accusing <PERSON> Spong </PERSON> and the diocese of engaging in a conspiracy against his tiny <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> parish, did not show any emotion as the recommendation was read. The lawsuit was dismissed from <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on the grounds it was a church matter, but <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> is appealing that decision. About 20 <ORGANIZATION> Ascencion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> parishioners, who had gathered at diocesean headquarters for the verdict, appeared stunned but remained quiet. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 56, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> native, has headed the church in a poverty-stricken <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhood for 12 years. <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, a parishioner for eight years, said Sunday that <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> had drawn her back into the Episcopal church with social activism and efforts to make religion relevant to current problems. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> wore a button at today's announcement of the verdict urging <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to free black activist <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, said the priest would appeal to the church's provincial court of review. The panel decided that <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> had known that the allegations he made in the suit were false. `` The filing of the secular court action ... should never be done lightly or unadvisedly and certainly not before exploring other avenues,'' the panel said. The group ruled that <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> failed to make a good-faith effort to settle the dispute. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, who has been banned from practicing his priestly duties since March, was the first church official to face an ecclesiastical trial since the Episcopal diocese was founded 113 years ago. In his lawsuit, <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Spong </PERSON>, diocese vice chancellor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehill </PERSON> and the diocese itself manipulated canon law to try to take control of the parish's assets, including $ 600,000 paid out by an insurance company after a fire all but destroyed the church in 1986. At the end of the nine-day trial Thursday, diocese prosecutor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlynn </PERSON> called <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> a `` failed priest'' and a `` liar.'' On Sunday, in the smoke-stained chapel of <ORGANIZATION> Ascencion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, a small cluster of faithful rallied on behalf of the priest. The chapel is all that remains of the church. It has received only makeshift repairs since the fire because the parish's funds became embroiled in a legal battle with the diocese.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> today called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to restore relations and urged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders to fulfill their people's desire for more freedom. The former president, the most prominent American to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the June military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, made the remarks at a banquet at which Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> was host. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said the killing of hundreds of unarmed citizens as troops stormed central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to recapture student-held <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> had `` cast a shadow over our relations.'' Addressing <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, one of the leaders responsible for calling in the military, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said differences between `` you, a Chinese Communist who believes in <LOCATION> Leninist </LOCATION> rule -LRB- and -RRB- I, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> conservative who believes in capitalism and democracy, are too great to permit a common understanding of this tragedy.'' But he added: `` Let us not become mired in endless and fruitless recriminations over the seeming impasse ... Both of our nations must now deal realistically with the aftermath.'' He said the two powers should return to the formula of 1972, the year of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s historic door-opening visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, `` acknowledging our profound differences while realistically identifying and pursuing our common interests.'' U.S.-Chinese relations have hit a low since June, with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> cutting off all high-level official contacts and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> accusing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of supporting forces trying to turn <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> into a capitalist state. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, asked about <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s statement that it was time to normalize relations, White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` We have always said that we want to resume good relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at some point. The question really is, when and under what conditions? I would say that at this point we have not reached that time and we have not seen the right conditions.'' Asked if <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was carrying a letter from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` I'm not aware of a letter. Now he talked to the president and to Gen. Scowcroft -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser Brent Scowcroft -RRB- before he left, so maybe he interpreted that conversation as some kind of message.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said it was in neither in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s nor <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s interest for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to return to its former isolation. `` The choice is clear,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said. `` Shall <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> turn away from greatness and consign itself to the backwater of oppression and stagnation? Or does it continue to venture forth on the open seas on a journey which may at times be rough but which leads to progress and peace and justice for its people?'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> expressed confidence that a `` humanely governed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that is responsive to the yearnings of its people will continue its rapid ascent in world affairs.'' `` Let us therefore rise above the acrimony of the moment and resume the progress and cooperation that are worthy of two great peoples,'' he said. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, traveling as a private citizen at the government's invitation, was making his sixth visit since his 1972 trip That journey paved the way for restoration of China-U.S. ties in 1979. At a banquet Saturday night, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> for having shown the `` foresight and sagacity of an outstanding statesman'' in 1972. `` At present, when Chinese-U.S. relations are at a difficult and critical moment, he is paying his sixth visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, once again showing his political foresight and courage,'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said. The former president, who arrived Saturday, was expected to meet senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> on Tuesday.

 Less than a year ago, Chinese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials gathered at a glittering hotel and celebrated 10 years of friendship with dumplings and <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>. Then came the Chinese army attack in June on students demonstrating for democratic reform, and both sides wondered if they had n't made a terrible mistake. Americans expressed horror that a country they regarded as friendly was capable of such harsh repression. Chinese officials accused Americans of taking advantage of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` open door'' to sow subversive ideas among intellectuals and students. The topic of relations has become so ideologically sensitive that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> scholars on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affairs refuse to be interviewed. Many have been investigated for alleged involvement in the democracy movement. Months have gone by but emotions remain high on both sides, with little prospect of cooling soon. Leading proponents of realpolitik, including former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and his former aide, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, have visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and said it is in both sides' interests to maintain good relations At a banquet Monday, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must overcome `` huge and unbridgeable'' differences and resume cooperation. He also called for a `` humanely governed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` We have always said that we want to resume good relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at some point. The question really is, when and under what conditions? I would say that at this point we have not reached that time and we have not seen the right conditions.'' Indeed, each government has made it clear it expects the other to make the first move in returning to `` normalcy.'' Some say it was the past relationship that was abnormal, with both sides allowing emotional attraction to outweigh differences in ideology and even practical self-interest. `` There was an element of delusion _ that things were getting better every day in every way,'' said one American working in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Even if the two governments mend their ties, he said, `` things are not going to be the way they were before.'' The clearest symbols of the new relationship are the guards, with battle helmets and automatic rifles, who took up positions around the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and ambassador's residence in June. Plainclothes officials lurk nearby in unmarked cars. As long as Chinese dissidents <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, remain in one of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compounds, the special guard is unlikely to leave. Things could get worse. Legislation is pending in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would suspend government trade and development programs, bar sales of police equipment, limit high-technology transfers and allow <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stay several years beyond their visa expiration dates. So far, the only sanctions are those announced in June by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who halted high-level contacts and military sales and urged a freeze on international agencies' loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he is waiting for the `` proper signals'' from Chinese leaders before lifting the measures, but has not spelled these out. Signals might include an end to martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, imposed May 20 during the peak of the student protests, or other moves to ease the crackdown on dissent. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it wants non-political exchanges to go on, especially cultural ones. But here <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has pulled back, canceling scholarly exchanges and plans to accept <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteers. Chinese education officials have indicated fewer students will be sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also has avoided spelling out conditions for normalization, but says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must take the initiative. Its basic demand is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> silence on Chinese domestic affairs. The quarrel is not the first since <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> re-established diplomatic relations on Jan. 1, 1979, nor is it in some ways the worst. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to the rival government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in the early 1980s triggered threats from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to downgrade relations. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> canceled sports and cultural exchanges in 1983 after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> granted asylum to a defecting Chinese tennis player, Hu Na. It may be proof of the relationship's maturity that this time <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has not threatened to cut or downgrade relations, and that many normal exchanges have gone on, including trade. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also appears to be drawing a line between hard-line statements for domestic consumption, which condemn the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as decadent and imperialist and accuse it of violating international law, and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>'s more moderate statements to foreign audiences, in which he stresses respecting differences and seeking common ground. On neither side do conditions yet exist for compromise. The lineup of forces in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s domestic power struggle requires officials to prove their ideological purity by denouncing Western `` bourgeois'' ideas. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the administration seems disposed to resume normal ties gradually. But it is held back by continued anger from a public that watched the confrontation between troops and protesters on television. Chinese scholars noted last year, even during the anniversary celebrations, that the potential existed for serious rifts. `` We are friends, not allies,'' said <PERSON> Mei </PERSON> <PERSON> Renyi </PERSON>, an associate professor of American studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foriegn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. He could not be interviewed now because he is being investigated for supporting the democracy movement. `` Our systems are different, our ideologies are different,'' he said then. `` Our expectations should be realistic.''

 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is being beseiged by the rest of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to continue a 19-month cease-fire with the Contra rebels, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position is one of `` waiting and watching,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s threat at a weekend conference in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to abolish the cease-fire _ since modified _ brought him ridicule from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, joined later by sharp criticism from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional leaders. `` The issue pretty much goes back to President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in the sense that he's changed his position a little bit,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We obviously are urging that the cease-fire be maintained.'' `` At this point it's pretty much a point of waiting and watching to see what he -LRB- <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> -RRB- does,'' the spokesman said. He said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s threat to end the unilateral cease-fire has alienated most of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s neighbors and that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> was being pressured by them to preserve the status quo. After first declaring his intention to end the cease-fire, the Nicaraguan leader said he would decide Tuesday whether to extend the truce or to resume hostilities between his leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-backed Contras. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had claimed he would abrogate the cease-fire because Contra forces had violated it, but <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> accused the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> of violating the cease-fire far more often than the rebels. `` Violations by the Sandinistas dwarf the violations by the Contras,'' he said. At the same time, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s depiction of <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> as a `` little man.'' `` The president was referring to small-minded pettiness,'' and not <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s height, he said. Even though administration officials privately said it was unlikely that the administration would seek a renewal of lethal military aid for the Contras, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused to be drawn into a discussion of the prospects. `` We just wo n't speculate on the possibility,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., on Sunday joined <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s condemnation of <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> for threatening to end the cease-fire `` It was a very unwise move, particularly the timing of it,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, calling <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> a `` tinhorn dictator,'' said he will present a resolution to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday condemning the Nicaraguan leader. For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday called <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> a `` little man'' and an `` unwanted animal at a garden party'' after <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he might no longer honor the cease-fire between his Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed Contras that has been in effect since March 1988. Although he later said he would decide on Tuesday whether to break the cease-fire, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s original declaration marred a two-day Western Hemisphere conference held in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to honor that nation's 100 years as a democracy. Any effort to renew <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras would be sure to generate strong new opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement reached last spring between the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> envisions a disbanding of the Contras after the Feb. 25 elections. The agreement gives congressional committees that oversee Contra aid the authority to cancel a $ 49 million aid package when they review it a final time in late November. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked at a news conference on Saturday whether he would now press for more military aid for the Contras, said, `` We'll let you know, we'll let you know.'' However, a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not trying to hint that he might seek to renew military aid. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, interviewed along with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' called <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s declaration _ which startled participants at the conference _ an outgrowth of a rivalry between the Nicaraguan leader and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. `` It is my hope the free and open election process will go forward and that the results will be accepted by the people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. He said `` we intend to honor'' the agreement with the administration last spring to provide humanitarian assistance through the Feb. 25 elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he hoped as a result of <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s statements `` we'd have quick action on the remaining humanitarian aid. `` There are 2 million people registered to vote'' in the election, in which <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is a candidate, said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` I think <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> sees that as a danger to his dictatorship. If it's a fair election, he's gone _ which would be good news for everyone.'' The focus now remains one of support for <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s opponent, <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, in the February presidential election, as well as measures aimed at ensuring that the voting is honest. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is funneling $ 9 million through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a quasi-governmental agency that promotes democratic elections around the world. A plan advanced in August by the presidents of five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries calls for the disbanding of the Contras even before the elections, by Dec. 8. A cease-fire has never been formally agreed between the Sandinistas and the Contras, though <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has informally extended it on a monthly basis since March 1988. Scattered fighting has continued all along, so whether <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> intends any real escalation of his military operations against the dwindling <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> force, such as attacking rebel camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, remains to be seen. An administration official said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is for neither side to violate the cease-fire. In fact, the official said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off assistance to a group of Contras operating in the southern part of the country several months ago when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials learned they were violating the cease-fire.

<HEAD>White House Rejects Call for Higher Taxes on Gasoline</HEAD>

 The White House today rejected a Republican leader's call for higher taxes on gasoline and also said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not easing his opposition to Democrats' formula for raising the minimum wage. `` We do not feel that an increase in federal gas taxes is necessary at this time,'' said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had said Sunday that although he still supports <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` no new taxes'' pledge, he would back a gasoline tax increase to rebuild the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> infrastructure _ such as roads, bridges and other public facilities. However, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he would not back a gas tax hike for deficit reduction. On the minimum wage, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We are not changing our position at this point'' although he noted that White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> has been conferring on the issue with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders. House Democrats are casting the minimum wage issue as a poor vs. rich matter that, along with his demand for a capital gains tax cut, leaves the president's allies a bit nervous. `` The issue has been greatly simplified, at least for a great many of us,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, referring to a new scaled-back <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal. `` It's time to change the minimum wage; $ 4.25 over the next two years -LRB- from the current $ 3.35 an hour -RRB- is agreeable to me.'' <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> is among several Republicans and conservative Democrats who last summer supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of a proposed increase to $ 4.55 an hour by 1992, but who do n't want to walk the plank again. `` They -LRB- the White House -RRB- know that things are moving away from them,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penny </PERSON>, D-Minn., one of 28 House Democrats who supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto `` Everybody wants this to be the last time we have to vote on his bill.'' House Democratic leaders have scheduled a vote Wednesday on a bill to raise the $ 3.35 wage floor, which has not changed since 1981, by 45 cents on Jan. 1 and by another 45 cents an hour in January 1991, to $ 4.25. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be asked Tuesday to adopt a resolution condemning Nicaraguan leader <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s decision last week to call off a 19-month cease-fire between Sandinista forces and U.S.-backed rebels. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats this week also will keep trying to prevent Republicans from attaching a capital gains tax cut to legislation providing a three-year aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> or to a bill raising the ceiling on the federal debt. `` Obviously, capital gains has nothing to do with aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' program. `` I hope very much that we'll be able to proceed.'' Before turning to the minimum wage Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will consider bills Tuesday appropriating $ 8.8 billion for the war on drugs and banning smoking on all airline flights. House Democrats have given the administration until Tuesday to either sign on to their minimum wage plan or face a new series of claims that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is insensitive to the poor while also seeking to cut the capital gains tax. Accepting a compromise would mean dropping <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` first, best and only offer'' vow to veto any increase to $ 4.25 in less than three years. He also vowed to veto any bill that does not include a sub-minimum `` training `` wage of $ 3.35 for any new hire for the first six months. The new Democratic version includes a 60-day sub-minimum wage applicable only to first-time workers with no previous job experience. Democrats have indicated a willingness to add another 30 days to the training wage. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides are well aware that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers up for re-election in a year are getting skittish. `` I do n't think the president would enjoy vetoing a second minimum wage bill,'' House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> told reporters. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, suggested last week that Democrats start referring to the minimum wage as a `` favorable minimum gains treatment'' to contrast it with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capital gains proposal that would `` give the wealthiest 600,000 a $ 25,000 windfall The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already has approved the capital gains tax cut, an aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and legislation raising the debt ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> accused Democrats of `` obstructing any effort to bring up capital gains.'' `` Just give us a vote, that's our strategy,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Let's vote Tuesday. The current $ 2.87 trillion ceiling expires at midnight Tuesday, but the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was borrowing an emergency $ 17.6 billion today to keep the government in business for another week and cover November Social Security checks.

 The main opposition leader, barely able to file in time Monday because of a bomb threat and other delays, accused the governing party of `` masterminding a plot'' to keep him out of next month's elections. Analysts say the parliamentary elections Nov. 22, 24 and 26 may be the closest since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> 42 years ago. <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION> party, filed his nomination papers in the <LOCATION> Fatehpur </LOCATION> district barely half an hour before the deadline on a day filled with delay and diversion. He had been airborne 28 minutes when his plane, part of the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Vayudoot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> fleet, returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> because of a bomb threat. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> conducted a protest at the airport, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. After a three-hour delay, in which no bomb was found but an unspecified technical problem was reported, the plane again took off for <LOCATION> Kanpur </LOCATION>, the nearest airport to <LOCATION> Fatehpur </LOCATION>. After that, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> had to drive two hours to reach <LOCATION> Fatehpur </LOCATION> in time, an aide in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> said. The 58-year-old opposition leader, a former ally of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> who has served him as defense and finance minister, claimed <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was responsible. `` It is a defeat of the government,'' said <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jain </PERSON>, a Janata Dal official. `` He reached <LOCATION> Fatehpur </LOCATION> barely 30 minutes before the nominations were to close, but he did it.'' Both <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> are running for Parliament seats from <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> filed Oct. 24 as a candidate in the <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION> district. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s charges are among several unrelated problems besetting <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Last week, the forestry minister was accused of making improper advances to an environmentalist. On Monday, the defense minister refused to run for re-election to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> because, he said, `` an inexperienced, non-political coterie'' of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> aides would not let have the district he wanted. As if his political difficulties were not enough, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s dentist revealed that the prime minister had a serious toothache It came to light after <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and several bodyguards were seen arriving at the dentist's clinic Monday. Z.R. <PERSON> Ansary </PERSON>, the minister for environment and forests, was accused by <PERSON> Mukul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutta </PERSON>, 26, an environmental activist from the Himalayan hills, of trying to molest her Oct. 9 in his office. She told a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> news conference 2 -LCB- weeks later that <PERSON> Ansari </PERSON> lunged at her, `` violently assaulting me in a most obscene and degrading manner.'' <PERSON> Ansari </PERSON>, 64, called the charge a politically inspired fabrication. `` Even an insane sex maniac should be credited with more intelligence'' than to attack a woman in his own office with staff members nearby, he said Saturday. Defense Minister <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Pant </PERSON> said he wanted to run for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nainital </LOCATION>, his home district in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>, and would not contest the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> constituency to which he was assigned. `` The revival of state party bossism and the unwarranted interference of inexperienced non-political coteries in political decision-making has been causing concern to all of us for some time,'' Pant said in a letter to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. His reference was to a group of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s old school friends who are closely involved in the campaign.

<HEAD>Engineers Back at Work on Arms Programs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A handful of Chinese engineers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to aid a $ 600 million arms sale to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have returned to work on the program, but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that weapons deliveries suspended by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in June have not resumed. Officials, responding to a report in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, stressed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had suspended shipments _ not ended them _ after the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators. The Chinese engineers, who apparently did not leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the summer, returned during the last few weeks to the Grumman factory in <LOCATION> Bethpage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, `` to provide technical support which will enable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> work to continue during the suspension,'' a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. The main parts of the deal with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are a program to improve avionics on F-8 jets and the manufacture of torpedos, radar and artillery ammunition. `` In view of the long-term interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it has always been the president's intention to suspend _ not terminate _ US-People's <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> FMS -LRB- foreign military sales -RRB- programs, with the hope that circumstances would permit a resumption of normal relations,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Still, the official added: `` There are no deliveries. The president's decision remains in effect.'' The sanctions imposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were considered inadequate by several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who called for harsher measures as an expression of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights convictions. The bloody June 4 crackdown on students in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was seen by millions of Americans on television, contributing to public criticism here of the Communist government as it reversed a moderating trend. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> emphasized then that maintaining strong ties with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was in the strategic interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Two other sanctions, apart from a halt to weapons deliveries, have been reversed or watered down since June. The president's ban on the visit of high-level <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> did not preclude <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> from meeting with <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> foreign minister, at a conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> at the end of July. Also, dependents of American diplomats who were evacuated from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulates returned weeks later. On Monday, former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, the most prominent American to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the military crackdown, called on the two nations to restore good relations and urged Chinese leaders to shun the `` backwater of oppression and stagnation'' and respect the yearnings of their people. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> spoke with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and National Security Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> before he left for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not know if <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was carrying a letter from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership. Responding to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s call for normalized relations between the two countries, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` We have always said that we want to resume good relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at some point. The question really is, when and under what conditions? I would say that at this point we have not reached that time and we have not seen the right conditions.''

They said two other attendants were wounded. The gas station was heavily damaged, but there was no fire. Another mortar exploded at a nearby fried chicken restaurant, causing extensive damage and wounding one boy, the witnesses said. Two more mortars blew up at the entrance of the military compound and three more exploded in a parking lot at a nearby baseball stadium, wounding at least one soldier and one civilian, the witnesses said.

<TEXT>
 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> National Security Adviser <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> visited the site where more than 4,300 Polish officers were slain in World War II, and he called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to take responsibility for the massacre. At the same time of <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>'s visit to the memorial to the officers in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, 17 miles south of the <LOCATION> Byelorussian </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION>, a group of more than 400 Polish relatives of the dead arrived for a commemorative Mass. `` It's purely a coincidence,'' <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> said when asked if he knew the Polish group was coming. He was visiting <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> while in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to participate in an East-West conference. A monument at the site pays tribute to the `` victims of Fascism _ Polish officers shot by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1941.'' However, most Poles and Western historians believe the officers, the cream of the Polish intelligentsia, were killed by the <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s secret police, in 1940 after they were deported to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> following the outbreak of World War II. The <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> discovered the graves in 1943 and blamed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but the Soviets said the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> had murdered the men in 1941, during the German army's march on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We owe it to the families of the victims to say that this was done by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> said. `` These victims represented a community of suffering shared by the Polish and Soviet people ... the truth of what happened should be a point of reconciliation for both countries,'' he said. A Soviet-Polish historical commission set up by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to clear up historical `` blank spots'' has yet to deliver a final verdict on the controversy, which for Poles remains their most painful wartime memory. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> last week that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was still conducting investigations and searching for documents, but that it was interested in finding `` the truth.'' Many Poles hope the matter will be cleared up by the time Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> makes his first visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in November. The Polish side pre-empted a joint declaration on responsibility in August when the Polish head of the commission, <PERSON> Jarema </PERSON> <PERSON> Macizewski </PERSON>, said that documents show the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was responsible. <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, known for his staunch anti-communist views, indicated he believed the Soviets would ultimately change their version of the massacre. `` The fact that the Soviet government has enabled me to be here _ and the Soviets know my views _ is symbolic of the breach with Stalinism that perestroika represents,'' <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political and economic reform program. Until the Solidarity trade union was born in 1980-81, <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> was officially a taboo subject in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But a group calling itself the Families of <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> Victims has thousands of members throughout <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. More than 400 arrived in <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION> on the first special train organized by the Polish and Soviet tourist agencies. It was the largest group of Poles ever to visit <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> since Soviet authorities began allowing Poles to visit in groups about one year ago. `` We never thought we would be able to come here,'' said <PERSON> Agnieszka </PERSON> <PERSON> Stawowczyk </PERSON>, whose father was killed at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>. Three priests celebrated Mass in front of a wooden cross, which was surrounded by wreaths and Solidarity banners.

 A group of Salvadoran refugees met on the steps of the Capitol on Monday to demand legal status in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an end to aid to the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and support for negotiations to end the 10-year-old war. The meeting marked an end to a five-week caravan by 25 Salvadorans to 68 cities to explain the plight of the thousands of refugees seeking to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We applaud the passage of the ... bill in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, which would temporarily give Salvadorans the right to live and work legally in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' the group, calling itself the Salvadoran Refugee Caravan, said in a prepared statement. `` We call on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to likewise approve this bill, as a humanitarian gesture that is in accordance with the democratic values of this country.'' The Salvadorans also called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop backing the government of Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, whose party they said has `` direct ties to death squads.'' `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government also continues in the face of stepped-up violence against the civilian population and any political opposition,'' the statement said.

 A local official said today he is considering rebuilding a bridge that collapsed, plunging five people to their deaths, even though he has not obtained a professional opinion about the tragedy's cause. The dead were among more than 30 people who witnesses said were rocking the bridge back and forth just before it collapsed, spilling the group into the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Officials have speculated that the swinging motion put tension on the cables supporting the 77-year-old wood-decked structure and contributed to the collapse. People `` were just running in the air,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was driving to her nearby home when she saw the accident. Of the 18 people injured, seven remained hospitalized today, with conditions ranging from satisfactory to serious, authorities said. The dead, who had gathered in a nearby town for a church meeting, included three children. County officials as yet have not had an expert test the debris to determine what happened. County Judge <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Adcock </PERSON> said today that he would seek a historic preservation grant or some other funds to aid in rebuilding the bridge, which has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1986. In <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, the county judge has no judicial power, but is chief administrator of county government. `` Everybody feels a great sense of loss now that it's gone,'' <PERSON> Adcock </PERSON> said. He said a state police investigator had looked at the site with county officers, but <PERSON> Adcock </PERSON> did n't know whether the officer was an engineer. The judge said he `` had the name and address of a private engineer that will probably look at it.'' A state Highway and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> engineer and an engineer from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> said their agencies had no plans to get involved in the investigation, unless they were asked. `` No one has contacted us. It's out of our jurisdiction,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, heavy bridge and maintenance engineer for the highway department. `` I guess that's up to the <LOCATION> Cleburne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorites on how they want to handle it. If we had a request to look at it, it would be considered.'' There were no signs at either end of the bridge setting capacity limits or warning visitors against swinging the bridge, which was a popular pastime among young people. Officials did not believe any warnings were needed, <PERSON> Adcock </PERSON> said. `` If we would have had any inkling that it was n't safe, we would have had it shut down,'' <PERSON> Adcock </PERSON> said. Those on the bridge were attending an annual meeting of the Full Holiness church movement at nearby Prim. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said she saw the upstream side buckle. `` It just turned upside down and fell into the river,'' she said. `` One girl said it felt like a dream until she hit the water,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, who had traveled from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> with her sister, <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON>, for the church outing. `` Everybody was up there laughing and then all of a sudden it screeches and pops. It was real scary.'' Another member of the church group, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafferty </PERSON> of <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said he saw the bridge being rocked as he arrived. `` We thought it was kind of fun and it scared some people,'' <PERSON> Rafferty </PERSON> said. It `` just happened so quickly that no one had a chance to cry for help,'' he said. `` They did n't know what happened. It was pure terror. Arms were flailing. People were panicking. Everyone was trying to save themselves.'' As crews worked with cranes and bulldozers to remove the debris, residents brought flowers to lay at the foot of the bridge to remember the victims. Among the dead was <PERSON> Gayla </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, the 34-year-old daughter of the host pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> of Prim. Her uncle, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, had two teen-age daughters on the bridge. Both survived. `` At bedtime last night I told my daughters, ` Let's thank the Lord that y' all made it one more time. We knelt at the bedside and prayed,'' <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> said. `` I have feelings for the others. There's no way I can explain it. The others killed were <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Muldrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltman </PERSON>, 11, of <PERSON> Vancleave </PERSON>, Miss.; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, 13, of <LOCATION> Mayfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Catrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotrell </PERSON>, in her early 20s, of <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Most Californians Favor Sales Tax to Aid Quake Recovery: Poll</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `Gov. George...', to CORRECT that special session
proposed, not set for Tuesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A majority of Californians support a temporary sales tax increase to finance earthquake recovery efforts in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area, according to a newspaper poll published today. More than half the people polled also said the state should make existing freeways safer rather than construct new ones to ease traffic congestion, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll found. And five out of nine people polled said transportation officials should scrap plans to double-deck freeways, while 61 percent replied the government has failed to adequately ensure freeway safety. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, grappling with ways to finance recovery from the 7.1-magnitude temblor Oct. 17, has recommended a special session of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the quake aftermath. He planned to meet with legislative leaders later today to determine if such a session will be held. Of the 1,377 adults surveyed, 52 percent favored a temporarily higher sales tax to pay for repairs and to aid victims, while 41 percent opposed the idea and 7 percent were undecided, the poll found. On the average, people favoring the tax increase said they would pay about one cent more on the dollar for about two years, which would raise about $ 8.6 billion, according to the poll. In addition to an increased sales tax, which now ranges from 6 percent to 7 percent in different parts of the state, the governor is considering an increase the 18-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax. The gas tax increase was opposed by 60 percent of the respondents. On the question of highway safety, 57 percent of the respondents opted for making existing roads safer, while 32 percent called for building more highways and 11 percent said they were not sure, the poll found. Even in traffic-plagued <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, earthquake-wary residents favored by a 2-to-1 majority placing a higher priority on freeway structural safety rather than on freeway expansion, according to the poll. Half of those polled said they did not believe the collapse of the double-decked Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> was due to faulty construction or engineering incompetence. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday rejected the appeal of a member of a secular group who argued that he should have the same right to perform marriages as does a priest or rabbi. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Torcaso </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wheaton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, won an important victory in 1971, when the high court held that <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> violated his rights by barring him from becoming a state-commissioned notary public because he refused to declare a belief in God. In the current case, the justices, without comment, refused to disturb a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law favoring ordained ministers in officiating at weddings. The court rejected <PERSON> Torcaso </PERSON>'s arguments that the law violates religious freedom and separation of church and state. He contended that his constitutional rights are being denied because he is a counselor with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an educational and philosophical organization. <PERSON> Torcaso </PERSON> said he is similar to a priest, minister or rabbi and should have comparable rights. He has been allowed to officiate at weddings in other states, he said. However, he was rejected in 1988 when he applied to <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to perform weddings there. A <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> judge refused to overturn the county clerk's rejection Lawyers with the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> attorney general's office said the state law requires a $ 500 bond by anyone who is not an ordained minister and wants to officiate at a wedding. Ministers are exempt from posting the bond because `` ordination creates a presumption that the officiant is trustworthy and responsible,'' lawyers for the state said. <PERSON> Torcaso </PERSON> said he would have been barred under <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law from performing the wedding even if he posted the bond. The bond requirement, he said, applies only to judges or others who reside in the county where they seek to perform the marriage. <PERSON> Torcaso </PERSON> said other states have similar laws, but that they more liberally create exemptions that allow non-ministers to officiate at weddings. The Constitution `` prohibits states from establishing religious qualifications for persons who perform state functions,'' his appeal said. `` States can not impose religious affiliation and belief requirements upon persons who solemnize marriages.'' The case is <PERSON> Torcaso </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 89-375.

<DATELINE>CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five inmates are missing following the two-day rampage that was put down last week at the <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> state prison, authorities said today. State police and security personnel were continuing building-by-building searches at the prison, said a statement issued today by the <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Two buildings have not yet been searched. Also, a thorough search of the burned-out modular housing units had not been completed. `` As of late last night, our inmate population count was off by five. However, the sweeps will continue until the count is reconciled,'' the statement said. The statement did not specify whether officials fear the missing inmates are dead or escaped, except to say that there were no reported breaches of the prison fences during the riot and that security has remained heavy since. Inmates being kept in yards were being closely supervised, the department said. Corrections Department spokesman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said no possibilities had been ruled out _ including an escape, the deaths of the inmates, a paperwork mistake in accounting for the men, or the possibility that they are hiding somewhere on the prison grounds. Several investigations are expected to begin this week as officials try to determine the cause of the riots, including one by an independent panel to be named by Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. On Sunday, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the situation at the prison was `` progressing and calm.'' He said 744 inmates had been transferred to other state prisons since the prison unrest ended Friday. More than 100 people were injured during two nights of rioting that left many of the prison's buildings unusable. Six inmates and four prison staffers remained hospitalized Sunday. While the investigations at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> continue, authorities will be investigating in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, too, where inmates seized control of a cellblock at <LOCATION> Holmesburg </LOCATION> Prison for about four hours Saturday night. Corrections Commissioner <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said he intends to bring criminal charges against the inmates responsible for the riot. Guards recaptured the city prison's `` I'' Block, fighting with nightsticks as the prisoners fought back with homemade weapons, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said.

After the riot was put down, 114 <LOCATION> Holmesburg </LOCATION> inmates and 47 guards were treated or examined at hospitals and nine inmates were admitted. No guards were admitted, but three received severe injuries including multiple broken bones and deep cuts, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. Yet another disturbance started Sunday night, when a small fire was set in a trash can at the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. While the smoke was being cleared, about 100 inmates were taken to a gymnasium. Four young men refused to return to their cells voluntarily, forcing guards to `` escort'' them, according to a city police detective who refused to give his name.

 Four people shouting `` burn, baby, burn,'' torched three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags on the central steps of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol today in a bid to test the new federal law protecting the national symbol from desecration. All four demonstrators were arrested by Capitol police. `` We defy your law,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the flag burners, reading from a prepared statement. `` We challenge you Arrest us. Test your statute. Take it back to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and try once again to claim it is all consistent with your constitutional standards of free speech.'' The law, which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> allowed to take force without his signature, went into effect at midnight on Friday. The flag-burning demonstration had been scheduled for noon on the marble plaza of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Organizers announced it had been moved and led photographers and television cameras to the Capitol steps. One demonstrator produced a flag and ripped it. Two policemen tore the pieces of the flag from his hands. Behind them another man produced a flag and set it afire. Two other flags also were set ablaze as the four demonstrators chanted, `` Burn, baby, burn.'' `` Another shouted: `` Stop the fascist flag law. Oppose it.'' Policemen first attempted to extinguish the flames by stamping on the flags, them aimed fire extinguishers at the burning remnants, dousing them in a chemical stream and shrouding the scene in white smoke. Police spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said the four were identified as <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichner </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blalock </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The four were charged with violating the Flag Protection Act of 1989, demonstrating without a permit and diorderly conduct, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. Violation of the flag statute provides a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. The other two charges are misdemeanors and carry respective maximum penalties of $ 300 and 90 days in jail and $ 250 and 90 days in jail.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has issued the following guidelines for parents and children at Halloween: _ Children's costumes should be large enough so that warm clothing can be worn underneath, yet short enough so that a child wo n't trip. Avoid shoes that make walking difficult. _ For visibility, use light colors in costumes and attach reflective tape to them. Have children use reflective treat bags. _ Attach a small child's name, address and phone number inside his sleeve in case he gets lost. But do n't openly display the personal information on the child's costume. _ Masks can obscure a child's vision. Use non-toxic makeup instead. _ Be sure children travel only in familiar neighborhoods and that they do n't enter strangers' homes. They should follow a designated travel route with a definite return time and not trick-or-treat past dark. Give them coins to call home if any problems arise. _ Remind children not to eat any treat before it's been inspected by a parent. _ Teach children pedestrian safety. _ Motorists should slow down in residential areas and watch for children.

<TEXT>
 The White House on Monday defended anew President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s abortion-related veto of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s appropriations bill, which critics say has tied up funds to battle drugs in the nation's capital. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would sign the funding measure `` in a nanosecond'' if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would strip language liberalizing funding for abortions in the district. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday vetoed the district budget bill, including the annual $ 435 million federal contribution to the city's $ 3.4 billion budget. The bill would provide the city with an extra $ 32 million to hire more police, build prison space, launch a drug treatment initiative for pregnant women and other anti-drug activities. The 1989 murder rate in the city reached 369 over the weekend, tying the 1988 record. Authorities say many of the slayings are drug related. The measure would also lift a year-old restriction that bars the district from spending locally raised tax dollars to provide unrestricted abortions for poor women. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, that abortion-rights supporters were playing `` political games'' with the bill, and he vowed to stand like `` a brick wall'' against efforts to lift restrictions on abortion funding. `` The fact is the president vetoed it because of his beliefs on abortion. That's the way it stands,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` All they've got to do is strip that out, change the language back to the way it was and we'll sign that bill in a nanosecond. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> rejected the argument that the district should be free to do as it pleases with its own tax dollars. Under the law governing home rule for the district, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must approve the entire <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> budget, not just the federal contribution. `` It's all out of the federal money. It's federally appropriated. Everybody tries to use that argument it's local money. It's not,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> says 30 states and the district pay for abortions through Medicaid only to save the mother's life; eight states pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest or certain other circumstances; and 12 states pay for abortions deemed `` medically necessary.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the former two-time Democratic presidential contender who has moved to the district from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said Sunday that the veto demonstrates `` the colonial status of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>,'' and accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of `` tyranny.''

<HEAD>Executive Loses Appeal of Apple Juice Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> executive fighting his conviction for selling adulterated apple juice lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The court, without comment, left intact <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>'s sentence of a year and a day in prison and a $ 100,000 fine <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>, former vice president in charge of operations for <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION>, was convicted last year in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> of conspiracy and mail fraud for selling as pure apple juice what essentially was corn syrup. Government prosecutors said <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> first was warned by a <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> research director in 1977 that juice from its supplier, <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was adulterated. The prosecutors said many similar warnings followed. <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> did not fire <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as supplier until 1982, after a detective from the Processed <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> told him <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> was going to be hit with a lawsuit, the prosecutors said. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last March rejected <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>'s arguments that he improperly was convicted of conspiracy and fraud. But the appeals court said, `` The evidence was ample to permit the jury to infer that <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> conspired with the suppliers to perpetrate a fraud on the public through the distribution of the adulterated juice.'' Beech-Nut President <PERSON> Niels </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> also was convicted. He received the same sentence as <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> but was not involved in the appeal acted on today. <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> was fined $ 2 million after pleading guilty to selling adulterated and misbranded apple juice. The case is <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 89-216.

 The pilot of a training jet that crashed into the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, killing him and four others, was making his first attempt to land on an aircraft carrier, the ship's captain said today. The two-seat T-2 <LOCATION> Buckeye </LOCATION>, based at the <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, slammed into the carrier's tower and cartweeled in flames into the flight deck Sunday afternoon during a practice flight about 30 miles south of here in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` As I see it,'' said Capt. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flack </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, `` he ended up in a position which in naval aviation is known as being ` low and slow,' which is a very terrible place to be when you are coming aboard a ship.'' As the World War II-vintage carrier, the oldest in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, returned to its dock late this morning, several sailors' wives burst into tears and waved wildly as they spotted their husbands on the deck _ the first confirmation that their loved ones were safe. `` We were n't sure what kind of news they were giving us,'' <PERSON> Kayleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said after finding her husband. `` They said they had hit where he works, and they could n't identify some of the bodies.'' Names of the dead were not released pending notification of next of kin. One was a civilian worker, <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. In addition to the five dead, 17 were injured, one critically. <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said landing officers told the pilot, who was alone in the plane, to add power and waved him off but for some reason he was unable to comply. The man was a qualified pilot, <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said, but was only beginning to learn the difficult skill of landing on a carrier. `` The nose pitched up and he lost control of his ability to fly the aircraft and it went up and came into the island,'' <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. The plane was upside down when its wing tip hit the island, or tower of the 46-year-old ship, the captain said. The jet then smashed into the side of the island before crashing in flames on the flight deck. The wing tip broke off and remained imbedded in the superstructure today, but overall, damage to the ship was described as minor. Three planes parked on the flight deck were hit by debris. <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said the damage to the planes was not severe. When the plane crashed, aviation fuel ignited on the 889-foot-long blacktop deck, but the fires were quickly brought under control, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON>. The ship, which came under a deadly Japanese kamikaze attack 45 years ago this week, has 1,440 crew members and is the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s only aircraft carrier used exclusively for training. It is also the only carrier on which women serve. Two of the 17 injured people were taken by helicopter to hospitals in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>. Crew member <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, was listed in critical but stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in Mobile, said <PERSON> Suzette </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, nursing supervisor. He had burns over nearly half his body. Crew member <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Haleyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, was admitted to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Hospital in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said her injuries were not life-threatening. In <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, relatives of crew members worried about finding out who the casualties were. `` We're all just shaken. We do n't know what to think one way or the other. I just want to know something,'' said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, whose boyfriend serves on the carrier. The crash occurred six days before the anniversary of the Nov. 4, 1944, attack that killed 47 and injured 127 on the ship in World War II. The original crew plans to hold a reunion next weekend in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> was commissioned Feb. 17, 1943, and its planes sank or destroyed more than a million tons of Japanese shipping and 1,039 enemy aircraft during World War II. The carrier was dubbed `` The Blue Ghost'' by Japanese propagandist <PERSON> Tokyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> because she had reported it sunk several times only to return to battle painted a solid blue-gray color, unusual in wartime when ships are usually camouflaged. After the war, the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> was mothballed until being reactivated in 1955. It reported to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> on Dec. 29, 1962, to serve as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s training carrier. It is scheduled to continue that role after moving next September to <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The ship has been a favorite of movie producers with roles in the film `` Midway'' and the television miniseries `` War and Remembrance.''

 A World Series victory gave earthquake-battered <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> something to celebrate today, and thousands of hedonistic Halloween partyers helped <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> return `` to abnormal.'' `` A little happiness will help us bounce back,'' baseball fan <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> beat the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> 9-6 Saturday night to sweep the Bay Bridge World Series. About 300 A's fans showed up for a victory rally held this morning in downtown <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s Jack London Square. A parade was originally planned but the route down Broadway would have passed several quake-damaged buildings and organizers did not want to tax an already strained police department. The rally, featuring a moment of silence for quake victims, was too subdued for some fans. `` I prefer a parade, but we'll take anything we can get,'' said <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Held </PERSON>, whose childhood home in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> was destroyed by the quake. `` People need to get back on with everything, they should n't dwell on the quake. I thought that's why they let the series continue in the first place.'' The A's opted for the rally after winning the series and avoided the traditional champagne-spray locker room festivities out of respect for the quake victims. The celebration was unabashed at this weekend's 10th annual Exotic Erotic Ball in at the <ORGANIZATION> Concourse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exhibition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where the popular attire was lace, leather, chains and whips or next to nothing. `` The scare's over with. People want to get back to a routine,'' said <PERSON> Dagny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancy </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Penngrove </LOCATION>, whose floral costume of a stem and two blossoms was painted on and contained the barest stitches of clothing. Tickets were $ 25, and organizers are donating 25 percent of the proceeds to the disaster relief fund. As in the past, 15 percent is going to AIDS foundations. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a producer of the ball, estimated the number of people attending the Saturday night gala at 10,000-plus, but said the exact payout to charities has n't been determined yet. `` We're getting back to abnormal,'' said one of the revelers, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurry </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>. The 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck Oct. 17, causing $ 7.1 billion in damage in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area and south through <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. There had been 80 aftershocks of magnitude 3.0 or greater, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey reported Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 27,668 people had registered at disaster centers for housing assistance, grants or loans. People left homeless in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> demonstrated for housing. The death toll stood at 64, including 39 motorists killed in the collapse of Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. About 1,400 homes, 200 commercial buildings, and 12 city-owned structures were also damaged in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. Officials estimated the building damage in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> at $ 1.3 billion. `` We're now looking at the long, slow, insidious damage,'' said city emergency planner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Worlund </PERSON>. `` It's not dramatic, but it requires people to move out of their homes.'' The quake struck hard at those least able to afford it. Eight low-rent residential hotels were condemned, putting about 800 people into the streets. More than 400 people took refuge in <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s five <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelters. `` We'll be dealing with these folks for many months to come,'' said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportion </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said the damaged <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> wo n't be repaired until the end of November rather than Nov. 16, as previously predicted. A 50-foot section of the upper deck fell during the quake. Repair of the key commuter link between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> will cost about $ 1 million, said <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the weekend brought more scenes of people moving belongings out of damaged <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district apartments or picking through the rubble of demolished buildings for possessions. The public works department said the district sustained the city's greatest damage. Seventy structures were considered unsafe. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelesco </PERSON>, 75, teetered atop a mountain of rubble that had been his home for five decades. As he looked for important papers, the retired coffee salesman lamented he would have to leave the neighborhood he called `` close to heaven'' because rent on a new place would be too high. Crews labored to replace gas lines in a system that once served 5,700 customers. Water and electricity were restored, but residents were asked to limit use of appliances to avoid straining the system. `` There's only one guy out of 16 people staying here,'' psychologist <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said as friends lugged boxes to her car. `` I'm not staying here,'' she said, pointing to buckled concrete and building cracks. Seventy miles to the south, hundreds of poor people left homeless by the quake marched through <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> on Sunday to demand that low-income housing be built to replace lost homes. City Manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> said the city does not have the money to build replacement housing. After the two-hour march, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> addressed several hundred people on a hill overlooking a park where the homeless have been living in tents. `` We know that as soon as the publicity about the quake ends that you could be abandoned. We do n't want to let that happen,'' <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Police Attack Protesters After Anti-KGB Rally; Scores Detained</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Helmeted riot police wielding truncheons repeatedly charged and clubbed demonstrators Monday night after a candlelight vigil outside <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in memory of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims Scores of protesters were knocked to the ground, beaten and dragged into police buses. About 40 people were detained, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said, in what was the harshest crackdown on protesters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in more than 1 -LCB- years. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the protesters were `` trying to create as much disruption as possible, to display anti-Soviet posters and shout anti-Soviet slogans.'' The clashes took place on some of central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s busiest streets and were especially jarring because of the more permissive political climate instituted under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wide-ranging reforms About 1,000 Soviets converged on <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> headquarters at <LOCATION> Dzerzhinsky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> after dusk to mark the unofficial `` Day of the Political Prisoner'' and mourn the millions who were wrongly imprisoned or killed under <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. The hour-long protest, in which two rows of people holding flickering candles lined up on three sides of the building, proceeded peacefully. It had been organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks to commemorate those who suffered unjustly under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a self-styled opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. At the end of the demonstration, a splinter group of about 500 people, mostly young men, marched off in the direction of <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, a favorite rallying site for human rights activists. Chanting, `` Shame on the KGB!'' and `` The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> is the enemy of the people!'' the group was confronted without warning by riot police two blocks from <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> as they passed out leaflets to homebound commuters. The white-helmeted police, armed with long black rubber truncheons, formed a line, then waded into the protesters, clubbing at least four of their leaders to the ground, then dragging them into nearby buses for detention. The demonstrators retreated, then formed again and headed to <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, the main thoroughfare leading to Pushkin Square. The riot police and other uniformed officers sealed off the square and split the protesters into two groups. On Gorky Street, riot police again charged the demonstrators, taking about six into custody. As the protesters were dragged to the buses, spectators shouted: `` Shame! Shame!'' Several passers-by spat at a police car. Another group of demonstrators, gathered on the southeast side of <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, was also repeatedly charged by riot police, who ignored the dozens of television camera teams and foreign reporters who flocked there. Police formed a flying wedge to charge young people gathered under a Gorky Street archway, and dozens were seized bodily and dragged away to the waiting buses. It was the roughest treatment of an unsanctioned demonstration in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since December 1987, when about 200 burly men in civilian clothes roughed up Jews who staged a protest demanding the right to emigrate on the eve of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s departure for his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The 6 p.m. protest outside <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> headquarters began quietly as dozens of regular uniformed police watched the demonstration and directed traffic around Dzerzhinsky Square. At the center of the square is a statue of <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzerzhinsky </PERSON>, founder of the Soviet secret police. The demonstrators held candles and signs saying, `` Shame on the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> Executioners'' and `` Down with the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>.'' They originally had planned to circle the building, which houses the infamous <LOCATION> Lubyanka </LOCATION> prison where Soviets declared `` enemies of the people'' under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> were executed by being shot with a pistol in the back of the head. But police sealed off one side of the building to allow pedestrian and vehicular traffic to pass.

 Firefighters aided by decreasing winds worked today to surround a wildfire that charred more than 4,000 acres and forced 2,200 campers to flee, a spokeswoman said. A million-dollar estate and another home under construction burned Sunday, but there was no immediate estimate of total damage, officials said. Among those who left their homes when the fire threatened areas in and around this celebrity enclave was entertainer <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, according to a neighbor. The fire, which broke out about 5 a.m. Sunday in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> north of here, was caused by a power line that was blown down by the wind, said <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Crabtree </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> dispatcher. And the same fierce <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> wind helped fan the flames Sunday before dying down today. Firefighters surrounded 80 percent of the blaze by early today, Ms. <PERSON> Crabtree </PERSON> said. At one point during the morning, officials declared the fire surrounded, but Ms. <PERSON> Crabtree </PERSON> said that firefighters decided later to again describe it as only 80 percent contained because some hot spots were causing problems. `` We still have wind conditions, but not as drastic as Sunday,'' she said this morning. Gusts had gone as high as 40 mph or more Sunday; Ms. <PERSON> Crabtree </PERSON> did not have an exact wind speed figure this morning. The fast-moving fire sent out thick, dark smoke that forced closure for a time of 10 miles of the busy <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Malac </PERSON>, a neighbor of <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s, said she took her dog and fled in her car. `` I freaked out. We were both screaming and barking,'' she said. She got behind another car going down a road toward the ocean, and in her panic `` I thought, God, he's not going fast enough,'' she said. She said she later learned the other driver was <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. The fire left a barren trail similar to a moonscape. Up to 570 firefighters from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> counties battled the blaze while four air tankers and six helicopters bombed a two-mile front of flames with retardant and water. `` We do n't have access to the water up in those canyons. We are fighting it mainly from the air,'' said another fire spokeswoman, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. A pillar of smoke blew over the ocean north of <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> and could be seen for 30 miles to the south. Residents in the area hosed down the roofs of their homes, while charred trees and smoldering brush lined the coastal highway. In other areas, flames burned down to the ocean's edge, where they were extinguished by waves. About 2,200 people were evacuated from five area campgrounds, including 100 children from the <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kramer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION>. The 12 - and 13-year-olds were on a three-day weekend retreat, said camp coordinator <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kipness </PERSON> `` There was n't time to be scared; you could see the smoke,'' <PERSON> Kipness </PERSON> said. `` The kids responded very well.'' Farther inland, firefighters contained a 376-acre blaze in the Black Canyon-Box Canyon area near <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Sunday afternoon, said fire spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON>. No structures were burned and there were no injuries. The <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> fire moved east along <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION>, away from the city of <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, before it was contained, Ms. <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON> said. The closest densely populated area, the unincorporated <PERSON> Susana </PERSON> <PERSON> Knolls </PERSON>, was not threatened. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds that pushed the fires Sunday rose from a surface-level high pressure system in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> that sent air racing toward lower air pressure in the southwest. Such winds pick up speed and heat as they run over the southwestern deserts, canyons and mountain passes, and can reach speeds of up to 100 mph in isolated mountain passes, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffer </PERSON>.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets Resume Chemical Weapons Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials opened talks Monday seeking to resolve differences in proposals to reduce their chemical weapons arsenals. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> wants a ban on the production of poison gas but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to continue producing chemical weapons even after an international treaty calling for their destruction is signed. The Soviets say they have stopped producing chemical weapons and will begin unilaterally destroying their stockpile. The 40-nation <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Disarmament Conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, which includes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, has a long-standing consensus that production of poison gas should end when a treaty to ban the weapons takes effect. Experts on chemical weapons fear that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to make chemical weapons, Third World nations will be encouraged to build chemical factories capable of producing poison gas. The superpowers hope that if they can agree to scrap most of their chemical weapon stockpiles, they will spur global acceptance of a treaty banning poison gas. Five days of talks opened Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> leads the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, and <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Batsanov </PERSON> is the chief Soviet negotiator. Diplomatic sources said the talks were being held at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missions to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The negotiators will discuss the exchange of information on their chemical weapons capabilities and inspections of military and civilian factories and storage sites. <PERSON> Dulin </PERSON> said the talks also would take up the differences in the Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approaches to scrapping chemical weapons. These are the first negotiations since September, when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> unveiled competing proposals to scrap the weapons. On Sept. 25, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered to cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons stockpiles by 80 percent if the Soviets reduce their arsenal to the same level. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> says it has 50,000 tons of poison gas. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpiles are estimated at about 30,000 tons of nerve gas and the agreement would leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> each with about 6,000 tons. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Sept. 26 said the superpowers should go further. He challenged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to agree to stop making all types of poison gas, including binary weapons, which are harmless until two chemicals are combined just prior to use of the gas shell. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has approved funds to continue production of binary poison gas bombs and shells, and administration officials say they intend to continue production of the safer shells even after signing a treaty phasing out the weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> wants to replace its single-element gas shells with binary weapons. The single-element shells are extremely dangerous if they leak, which sometimes occurs because of aging or damage. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed an agreement to begin cuts at once while an international treaty is worked out in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over eight years if the Soviets joined the ban. The remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban. A conference of more than 145 nations in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in January called for a comprehensive, verifiable treaty to ban chemical weapons. The Geneva Protocol of 1925, adopted after 1.3 million people were killed or injured by poison gas in World War I, banned the use of such weapons in war, but allows their manufacture and possession. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s repeated use of poison gas in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> brought brought international attention to the issue. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> resumed production of chemical weapons in 1987 after their manufacture had been banned in 1969. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said new weapons were needed to match growing Soviet stockpiles.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a case closely watched by civil rights groups, was asked Monday to decide whether federal courts can order higher taxes to finance school desegregation. The state of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> urged the justices to invalidate a federal judge's 1987 order that doubled local property taxes in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, saying it was `` taxation without representation.'' <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartow </PERSON> <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an attorney for the state, argued that courts lack the power to impose or authorize higher taxes even to correct a constitutional violation such as racial discrimination in schools. `` There is no power to tax, period,'' <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> told the justices. Although constitutional issues dominated the 60-minute session, lawyers for both sides answered questions by several justices about a possible procedural flaw that could preclude a ruling on the tax issue in the case. The school district and parents of a group of school children, who brought the original desegregation case in 1977, contend the state waited too long to file a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal. The school district asked the court to affirm a decision by the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upholding the property tax increase ordered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is expected to issue a decision in the case by next July. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, the school district's attorney, said it would be `` dangerously wrong'' to deny federal courts the broad powers needed to implement their orders to correct constitutional violations. Striking down the tax order, he contended, would permit state property tax law and local voters to frustrate the constitutional rights of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s minority schoolchildren to an equal educational opportunity. Federal courts, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> argued, `` have the powers and have the duty to use their equitable discretion'' to remedy constitutional wrongs. Several justices questioned whether there were any limits on the powers of the federal courts to correct racial segregation in schools. At one point, Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> asked if a court could order higher taxes to `` gold plate all the schools?'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> discounted the justice's example but said a court's remedy to constitutional violations was limited to what was `` feasible and practicable. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> described the judge's tax order as a `` drastic remedy'' and questioned whether the district court should have made an `` explicit finding'' that higher taxes were the only reasonable solution. The state, in response to questions by Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, maintained that the judge had failed to consider other options, such as scaling back the desegregation plan. One alternative opposed by the state, <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> conceded, was to require the state of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> to pay all of the costs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> ordered the tax increase in September 1987 after the local school district was unable to pay its share of a $ 400 million desegregation plan he had approved for capital improvements in buildings and establishment of special `` magnet'' schools. State law says local property taxes can be raised only with voters' approval, and in some instances only with a two-thirds majority. District voters had not approved a levy increase since 1969, with four tax increase proposals rejected in 1986 and 1987 to finance the desegregation plan. The appeals court, in August 1988, upheld the district court's authority to order an increase in the property tax but changed the procedure for imposing the higher tax levy in the future

<TEXT>
 Human rights activist <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, who spent nine years in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> prisons, is considering visiting <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a spokeswoman said Monday. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was considering the offer from the Jewish Confederation of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a newly formed umbrella group for Soviet Jewish organizations, to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in December, said the spokeswoman, who insisted on anonymity. She was speaking from the Jerusalem-based Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum headed by <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> told the Maariv newspaper that he was interested in visiting <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to encourage Jewish emigration to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but was concerned that publicity from his trip might benefit President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` I have no special nostalgia for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said. `` My consideration to return and visit there will be if such a visit would help our struggle to encourage the Jewish awakening.'' `` I know that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can benefit from a visit like that and I have to consider who would gain more, Soviet Jews or <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' he said. In the early 1970s, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a human rights watchdog group headed by Nobel Prize laureate <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> made contacts with foreign journalists in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and gained prominence as a spokesman for organization. He also championed the Soviet Jewry emigration movement. He was denied an exit visa to join his wife, who left for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> a day after their wedding in 1974. In March 1977, he was arrested and in 1978 convicted of espionage and sentenced to 13 years in prison. He spent nine years in Soviet prisons and labor camps, becoming a symbol of the Soviet Jewry's plight thanks to the efforts of his wife, <PERSON> Avital </PERSON>, who tirelessly campaigned on his behalf in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was freed on Feb. 11, 1986, when he came West on <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Glienicke Bridge. Included in the swap were <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jaroslave </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaworski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Nistroy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, who were released by the East, and <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaczmarek </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yevgeni </PERSON> <PERSON> Semliakov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Detlef </PERSON> <PERSON> Scharfenorth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koecher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and his wife, <PERSON> Hana </PERSON>, who were released by the West. At first, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> kept a low profile in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But he emerged last year to found the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum, a lobby group seeking to improve conditions for immigrants from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He also heads the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrants </ORGANIZATION>' Organizations, which represents 18 groups uniting immigrants from 40 countries. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> told Maariv he believed the Soviets would issue him a visa. `` The Russians are making efforts to cut themselves off from the past. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON>, also an activist of the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> ... has recently visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> despite once being convicted as an enemy of the state, and faced no problems,'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said. `` This is not what may prevent my visit.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criticized on Monday the crackdown by Czech authorities on protesters who staged a pro-democracy demonstration over the weekend. Police arrested about 350 demonstrators, who participated in a march commemorating the 71st anniversary of the founding of the first independent Czech republic. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deplores the actions of the Czech government, which `` seriously call into question its stated interest in improving U.S.-Czechoslovakian relations.'' She said that `` the people of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> know what democracy is and they want it now.'' `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> calls on the government of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to respect the rights of its citizens and to institute the basic freedoms desired by the <LOCATION> Czechoslovakian </LOCATION> people,'' she said. Asked about indications of reform in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the administration welcomes them but added that <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> still lags behind the leaders of reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Among other measures, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> has indicated it will lift some restrictions on the activities of independent environmental activists and is liberalizing passport laws. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, asked about signs of increased public debate on government policy in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, expressed hope that this is another indication that the government is sincere about taking steps to meet the wishes of the people for reform. `` We will continue to watch developments in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> very closely, particularly overtures made by the regime to the opposition,'' she said.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Voters Gave Socialists a Warning</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 By returning the Socialists to power with only a one-seat majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, voters warned Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> to change the way his government runs the country, analysts said Monday. The victory was the third straight for <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a 47-year-old labor lawyer who became prime minister in 1982 and has presided over the fastest growing economy in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Pais </PERSON>, the nation's leading daily newspaper, said in an editorial: `` The voters have clearly decided they want to continue to be governed by the Socialists. But they demand, no less clearly, a change in style.'' It said the results of Sunday's election showed the public agreed with those who accuse the government of not meeting the demands of labor, allowing public services to deteriorate and showing arrogance in its exercise of power. Defections to the left reduced the Socialists to 176 members in the 350-seat <PERSON> Cortes </PERSON>, the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> where the power lies, eight fewer than in 1986. Their share of the popular vote fell from 43.4 percent to 39.55. The chief beneficiary of the 800,000-vote decline in Socialist support was the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> coalition of the Communists and other parties, which doubled its 1986 tally and gained 10 seats for a total of 17. Conservatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gained one seat to 106. The Democratic Social Center of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> won 14 seats, down five from 1986. Socialist losses were most striking in cities, where the deterioration and overloading of public services has become most evident. For the first time since <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> returned to democratic government after the death of dictator <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> in 1975, the Socialists lost to the conservatives in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and the surrounding area. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Anguita </PERSON>, Communist leader of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Left </LOCATION>, campaigned against economic policies that emphasize economic growth over government spending as the way to reduce an unemployment rate of 17 percent, highest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anguita </PERSON>, former mayor of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>, said a general strike that virtually shut down the country Dec. 14 demonstrated disappointment with <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' pro-business strategy. Surveys indicate, however, that most Spaniards believe they live better today than in 1982, when <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> took office and faced a stagnant economy, with annual inflation of 14 percent. Inflation is 7 percent, up two points from last year. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative daily, called the vote `` a tough electoral lesson'' for the Socialists, and the new, left-of-center <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Mundo </PERSON> said: `` The Socialists will have to govern in a different way.'' <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Periodico </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cataluna </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> paper, said the Socialists must do a better job of `` sharing the pie of well-being with those who are less fortunate.'' On Spanish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, Education Minister <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Solana </PERSON> said the government got the message. `` We would be a politically insensitive party if we did n't learn the lessons taught by the election results,'' he said. `` Will we go in the direction of more social spending? Within the possibilities, obviously yes.'' <PERSON> Solana </PERSON> said spending on social programs in the past two years had grown 60 percent faster than the economy, which has averaged nearly 4.5 percent annual growth. `` Since the economy can now continue to grow, we expect social spending to follow suit,'' he said.

 Then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> personally approved a plea bargain offered to <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> three days before they were indicted in October 1988, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' attorney says in court papers. The papers add detail to reported failed negotiations just before the deposed <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> leader and his wife were charged with siphoning more than $ 100 million out of their country's treasury and into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died Sept. 28. His wife awaits trial at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON>, said in the papers filed last month that government lawyers made the plea offer during a meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attended briefly by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. `` The attorney general started the meeting by advising us that the president was aware that the meeting was taking place, and what would be conveyed to us during the conference had the president's full knowledge and approval,'' <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said While the personal attention of the president in a criminal case is unusual, White House involvement can be expected in sensitive matters that carry implications for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy, government spokesmen said. `` It's not usual for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to be involved in the conduct of cases. It's not usual for the attorney general to be involved in the handling of criminal cases,'' <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Monday. `` But there are those times when issues do rise to the level of the attorney general or the White House.'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, declined to comment on the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> case because it is pending in the courts. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who died Sept. 28, and his wife were charged in a racketeering indictment Oct. 21, 1988, three days after the meeting described by <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON>. The trial of Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and her other co-defendants, including Saudi financier <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, is scheduled to begin March 14. <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON>'s account of the meeting said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> left after telling <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> and another <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON>, that the other government officials at the meeting were the `` sole representatives'' of the government in the matter and urging them to consider the offer seriously. The representatives were <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, then-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON>, he said. <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> is prosecuting the case. After <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s departure, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> described a `` nonnegotiable proposal with respect to the disposition of proposed charges against our clients which the government intended to present to the grand jury in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> ...,'' <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said he would bring the indictment unless the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION> agreed to his proposal by the end of the business day of Oct. 20, 1988, according to <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON>. He did not provide any details of the government's proposal. <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> said he would not comment on <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON>'s account. `` I'm not going to confirm that it's accurate,'' he said. Published reports at the time of the indictment, citing unidentified sources, said the offer called for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to forfeit millions of dollars worth of real estate, artwork and jewelry in return for a recommendation that he be spared a prison sentence. <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON>'s statement was filed in connection with a pretrial motion that seeks thousands of confidential government documents that Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers say they need to prepare her defense. His description of the Oct. 18, 1988, meeting was included in a section that claimed a number of government agencies, including `` the highest levels of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>,'' participated in the investigation. <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON>, in a separate statement in the filing, said Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers were seeking documents that might show prior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> knowledge of the Marcoses' allegedly illegal behavior; knowledge that the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION> had substantial assets other than those in the indictment; and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in the overthrow of the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> regime In response papers, <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON>, called the request `` a fishing expedition.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> has yet to rule on the request.

<HEAD>Percentage of Blacks in Military High, But Declining</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The percentage of blacks among the nation's military recruits has dropped since 1980 but minorities continue to be overrepresented in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s armed forces, said a congressional report released Monday Other changes found by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the study of the nation's all-volunteer armed services, included an improvement in standard military test scores and educational background of the current recruits. `` These results, like those for race, represent a considerable change from the beginning of the decade, when testing problems and recruiting difficulties resulted in large numbers of low scorers and non-graduates being accepted for military service,'' said the study. `` The Army achieved particularly impressive gains,'' said the report, `` Social Representation in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Military.'' In 1980, less than 70 percent of active-duty recruits for the four services _ <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> _ had high school diplomas. Only 55 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> recruits could lay claim to a secondary school degree. But seven years later, 94 percent of active-duty recruits for the four services had high school diplomas, as did about 91 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> recruits. About two-thirds of the recruits scored above average in comparison to the general youth population on the standard military entrance exams, the study said. On the issue of minorities among the recruits, the study found that between 1980 and 1987, the percentage of blacks among recruits with no prior military service fell by nearly 3 points _ 22.3 percent to 19.7 percent. In comparison, there was an increase of almost 1 percentage point in enlistment-age youths who are black. Contributing to the decline was the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, where the share of black recruits fell by more than 6 percentage points. The study also found that black recruits come disproportionately from sections of the country with above-average black incomes and better-educated black adults. In 1987, only 44 percent of the black male active-duty recruits came from areas in the bottom half of the income distribution for black families. Women accounted for less than 13 percent of active-duty recruits in 1987, a slight drop from the 14.2 percent in 1980. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> attributed the somewhat steady total to the limited number of military jobs for women. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> said the purpose of the study was to provide an objective analysis and not reach any conclusions about current patterns of representation and ways to change them. However, the study did say that instituting a draft would not change the social composition of the military unless enlisted strengths were significantly increased. `` The all-volunteer force is doing a good job of attracting a broad cross-section of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> youth,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on manpower and personnel and the lawmaker who requested the study. The study, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said, `` fills a major gap in our knowledge about who is attracted to the volunteer military.''

<HEAD>Parliament Passes Laws on Amnesty, Creates State Auditor's Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament on Monday approved legislation granting amnesty to many people convicted of crimes punishable by less than three years in prison, and it created an office to control government and party finances. The laws, to take effect in November, were among several items on the agenda on the opening day of the legislature's first session since it rewrote the communist constitution to reflect democratic ideals. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s rapidly evolving reform course has put it in the vanguard of democratic change within the Soviet bloc, along with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the first <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nation with a government not dominated by the communists. At its last sitting, which ended Oct. 20, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> adopted a series of laws and constitutional amendements establishing the legal framework for the first multiparty elections since the now defunct Communist party consolidated power in 1948. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ dissolved itself Oct. 7 at a historic congress that gave birth to its successor, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The new party, which professes democratic ideals, retains political control, but its leaders have promised to hand over power if defeated at the polls next year. In another major move to break with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> past, acting President <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> proclaimed the existence of the Republic of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> Oct. 23, the 33rd anniversary of the 1956 anti-Stalinist revolt. The proclamation, which formally terminated the Communist-created People's Republic of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, was cheered by more than 100,000 Hungarians. The amnesty law applies to those serving terms of three years or less who are in the following categories: pregnant women, women with children under 14 living with them, women over 55 and men over 60, and those suffering from terminal illness. The terms are halved for those in these categories serving sentences exceding three years. The amnesty does not apply to those facing or serving sentences for violent or sexual crimes. Creation of an auditor's office was meant to re-establish impartial control over government and party spending which was effectively abolished after the communists took over. The office, which also has jurisdiction over the finances of state enterprises, is responsible to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The number of legislators present to vote on the two bills differed, accounting for the different totals. Tuesday's agenda included a decision on when and how to chose a president, whose responsibilities include command of the armed forces and other major tasks. The newly created post was originally to be filled Nov. 26 by popular vote, but two opposition groups have collected more than 100,000 opposing signatures, enough to force a plebiscite on the issue. The groups _ the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> _ say the early date favors <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> because it does n't give the opposition enough time to organize and make their candidates well known. In addition, legislators planned Tuesday to discuss and vote on government proposals on a suspended <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> hydroelectric project with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally increasingly at odds with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> over its reforms. In declaring a moratorium in May on the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros dam project, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> expressed concern about potential enviromental damage. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has said it will continue construction and will demand compensation if work is permanently suspended by the Hungarians.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday he will send three Cabinet members and his chief economic adviser to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to help its non-communist government develop a strategy for overhauling the country's battered economy. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s struggle has always been <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s struggle,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Maybe that's why it seems that Polish hearts and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hearts beat as one.'' The delegation named by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will include government, business, labor and academic officials.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on Monday urged people to vote in next month's plebiscite for self-rule in the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, saying a boycott would be a mistake. It was the second time in three days that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has gone to <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>, the second largest <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> island, to campaign for the ratification of a plan to grant limited self-rule in 13 southern provinces. On Saturday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Cotabato </LOCATION> to start the campaign, but made no categorical appeal for voters to ratify the autonomy act, which was passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Voters in <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> and other southern islands go to the polls Nov. 19 to decide whether their provinces will join an autonomous regional government. The move is aimed at satisfying demands for self-rule for the 4 million-member Moslem minority. Christians form the majority in the provinces of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> and other southern islands. The bill, which Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> signed in August, has been facing public opposition even from Moslem secessionist groups. `` I understand that some groups are organizing a boycott of the plebiscite, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told hundreds of people at a rally. `` I think this would be a serious mistake. A boycott position is meaningless.'' She refused to say whether she was for ratification or rejection of the bill, adding that she was adopting a position of `` active neutrality.'' `` I have refused to dictate how people should vote for the plebiscite,'' she said. She said she had been accused by her foes as being indecisive, but she defended her stand, saying she upheld the principle of `` popular consultation.''

 A state board is caught in a political ruckus over its decision to clear an optometrist who had some women patients strip to the waist during eye exams. The <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Optometry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiners </ORGANIZATION> once voted to exonerate optometrist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION> but is reconsidering that decision in the face of intense public pressure. The case has angered some women, pitted health professionals against each other and raised questions about closed meetings of medical regulators. The seven-member board scheduled a telephone conference call Tuesday morning to decide if it wants to review <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s case. The board met privately for more than five hours Saturday. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> was hauled before the state licensing board on ethics charges after some women patients complained that he had them partially disrobe. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> argued he did so for legitimate reasons, to check for curvature of the spine associated with some eye disorders. Because much of the professional discipline review is private, the issue first came to light last month when the board cleared him. In its ruling, the panel said <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> was `` honestly attempting to provide the best care.'' That decision prompted an uproar from lawmakers and others. `` It was kind of like a foot doctor looking at the brain,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nystrom </PERSON>, ranking member of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The issue heated up when the attorney general's office joined with the board that regulates physicians in urging a new hearing. The medical board threatened a lawsuit, saying <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> strayed into the practice of medicine, for which he is n't licensed. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> complained about being hounded by reporters; then he and everyone else involved in the matter stopped commenting on the advice of lawyers, who expect the issue eventually will land in court. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> did say he no longer performs topless eye exams.

The grounding was the second in five days by a ship sailing along the 200-mile chain of islands at the southernmost tip of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who flew over to inspect the Yugoslavian-registered <PERSON> Mavro </PERSON> <PERSON> Vetranic </PERSON>, said the ship apparently `` was well embedded on a coral reef.'' `` It appears it has hit a crown jewel,'' he said. `` The reefs of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are crown jewels in the underwater environment.'' The ship was carrying 14,300 tons of phosphate for use in fertilizer, 120,000 gallons of heavy fuel oil and 23,000 gallons of diesel fuel, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. `` There is no visible pollution, there's no injuries at the moment, and the ship is hard aground,'' Petty Officer <PERSON> Alastair </PERSON> <PERSON> Worden </PERSON> said after a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter flew over the 16-year-old ship. An owner's representative was arranging for tugs, barges to lighten the ship's load and a salvage surveyor to determine what can be done to move the ship, stranded about 7 -LCB- miles northeast of Garden Key in the Dry Tortugas. The island cluster 70 miles west of <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is the site of <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION> and is marked by a tall lighthouse as well as the massive fort. The governor earlier proposed a 10-mile buffer zone for shipping off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to reduce the danger of groundings and spills, but international agreement would be required for any such change. No formal shipping lanes exist off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. `` We've had two of these -LRB- groundings -RRB- in less than a week,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` This will clearly show that we were not crying wolf when we first brought this up.'' The cargo ship ran aground at 1:45 a.m., but the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was n't informed until it received a message from another vessel at 7:50 a.m., said Petty Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> marine inspector, a representative of <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, the ship's insurer, and federal and state divers were among those sent to inspect the grounded ship. The ship, built in 1973, is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Atlanska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plovidba </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dubrovnik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, a port on the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The grounding came five days after a much smaller cargo ship, the 155-foot <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maitland </PERSON>, tore a 200-yard swath through coral in <ORGANIZATION> Key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Largo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanctuary </ORGANIZATION>, about 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> inquiry into that grounding resumed Monday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> with one crew member saying the ship's owner had a non-alcoholic policy but beer was in the ship's refrigerator. The first mate, who was at the helm, failed two breath tests after the grounding, but both he and the captain said he did n't start drinking until after the accident The unlicensed first mate, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, 43, has been charged with negligence, and the ship's captain <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, 37, with allowing an improperly licensed sailor to operate the ship. Ship repairs should be completed by Wednesday, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Report: Decade of School Reforms Had ``Modest Success''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 States have had only modest success in classroom reforms, although there was a greater effort at improving public education in the 1980s than ever before, a consortium of universities said Monday. `` State legislators introduced an unsurpassed number of education-related bills, increased state aid, and examined the findings of hundreds of state-level task forces and commission,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in Education. Local initiatives had the most progress on restructuring schools, said the report, `` The Progress of Reform: An Appraisal of State Education Initiatives.'' The report was based on research conducted in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and used as its benchmark goals set forth in `` A Nation At Risk,'' the 1983 landmark government report that prompted efforts to improve learning in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It is true that high school curricula are more academically oriented, standards for entering the teaching profession are more selective, teachers' salaries are higher and state and local governments have boosted educational funding,'' said the report. `` But the reforms met with only modest success in achieving their goals,'' the report continued. `` Doubts still linger about the rigor and challenge of some of the new courses in academic subjects, the impact of reform on at-risk students, the quality of teachers and teaching and the equitable funding of schools.'' The report said states tended to reject complicated reform recommendations in favor of more manageable ones. The most popular reform of the last five years was increasing graduation requirements, a relatively uncomplicated procedure, the report said. At least 45 states have modified high school graduation requirements since 1980, primarily by increasing the number of credits and academic courses needed to earn a diploma, it said. The easy reforms that were adopted have stayed in place, the report said. But more complicated reforms such as teacher assessments, career ladders and mentor teacher programs have been modified or diluted, it found. Reforms adopted by most states lacked coherence, `` sending a barrage of signals to schools and districts without setting clear priorities,'' the study said. The report said most of the progress resulted from initiatives at the local school district level. During the 1980s, several states encouraged school restructuring by providing seed money for local experiments, but some districts were developing changes without state support, it said. The federally funded <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> is a consortium of <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> universities and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> at Madison.

 Air pollution reached dangerous levels in the capital Monday because of warm, calm conditions, and the government announced emergency measures for cars and industry. The <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> banned all cars with license plates ending in even numbers from most of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> from 7 a.m. Tuesday to 10 a.m. Wednesday.

The independent PAKOE environment agency said 273 people received treatment for heart and respiratory problems heightened by the pollution. The weather bureau said warm, calm weather would continue on Tuesday, threatening to raise pollution levels even higher. Over the years air pollution has become a serious problem, reaching emergency levels whenever warm, windless weather traps the thick brown smog within the mountains that circle the coastal plain where more than one-third of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s 10 million people live. In September 1982 the government banned half of the capital's 800,000 private cars from the central <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> area during office hours Vehicles are allowed into the restricted zone on alternate days, depending on their license plate numbers.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Detroit Papers' Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A critic of the proposed partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Monday that permitting the move would be `` a terrific incentive for monopoly'' conduct. But a lawyer for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, defending former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s approval of the joint operating agreement, said such mergers are needed to protect the dwindling number of two-newspaper cities in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, an investor group offered to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> for $ 68 million from <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has said it will sell or shut down the paper if the joint operating agreement with the Gannett-owned <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> is overturned. The high court heard 60 minutes of arguments over the partial merger and is expected to announce a decision by July. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> has removed himself from consideration of the case, creating the possibility of a 4-4 tie that would uphold the joint operating agreement. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, representing a group of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> readers and advertisers who oppose the joint agreement, said both newspapers are `` competitive equals'' and could survive if they raised newstand prices and advertising rates. But, he said, the papers have been engaged in a price-cutting war for years designed to drive each other out of business or force a partial merger highly profitable to both. `` Their prices are too low and their advertisement rates are the lowest in the country,'' he said. If the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> permits the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> papers to operate jointly, `` It will result in artificial generation'' of other such arrangements, <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said. `` The profit possibilities are enormous.'' But <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the partial mergers are aimed at `` preserving two or more editorial voices'' in cities that otherwise might become one-newspaper towns. There are competing newspapers now in only 25 cities. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said there are enough potential readers in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to support two newspapers if there were `` a pricing czar'' to prevent price-cutting. `` Unfortunately there is no czar,'' he said. The federal Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 authorizes the attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an exemption from federal antitrust laws. The Free Press and News have agreed to combine their business, advertising and production departments but maintain separate news and editorial staffs. They put off the partial merger pending the high court's ruling on whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> improperly approved the deal in August 1988. The Free Press lost $ 10 million a year between 1981 and 1986. The News lost $ 50 million in the same period. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest newspaper publishing group and <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> is second. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> stressed that the two companies essentially have agreed to split profits down the middle if the joint agreement takes effect. That suggests they regard the newspapers as competitive equals and casts doubt on claims the Free Press is failing, he said. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> aggressively questioned <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>'s arguments that approving the joint operating agreement will not sanction predatory pricing forbidden by antitrust law Is this `` lawful or unlawful pricing?'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>. `` I'd like an answer.'' <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said, `` The record in this case does not suggest predatory pricing.'' He said it would be unfair to overturn the agreement and order further examination of that issue. The investor group that wants to buy the Free Press for $ 68 million is headed by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> McMaster </PERSON>. He said he wanted to convert the newspaper's format to a `` statewide community newspaper'' The case is <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, 88-1640.

<TEXT>
 An amateur astronomer using a homemade telescope said Monday he has discovered three new asteroids, and the editor of Astronomer magazine said he's the first Briton to make such a find in 80 years. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said he spotted the asteroids between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars using a 10-inch reflector telescope set up in his back yard in <LOCATION> Kidderminster </LOCATION>, 95 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Editor <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, who keeps track of all European astronomical discoveries, said <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>'s sightings were run through the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> computer in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and found to be previously unknown. `` To go for 80 years with no discovery, it is very important for British astronomy,'' <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>'s work, although he is an amateur, is rated as high as professional.'' Manning, 63, said astronomy has been his hobby since he was a boy. `` I'm delighted and did not expect it really,'' he said. `` You always hope you might find something ... but it's a surprise since the chance of discovery is rather remote.'' <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>'s discovery was his first attempt to identify an asteroid, and was sparked by the September issue of Astronomer, which challenged British amateurs to find an asteroid, <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said. Manning, a retired technician from <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metrology </ORGANIZATION>, which is the science of accurate measurements, said he made a 20-minute photographic exposure of the sky on Oct. 4 He did n't discover the asteroids until Oct. 5 when he developed the telescopic image and scanned it with a binocular microscope. `` My garden is not a very good spot. It's down in a hollow with trees all around,'' he said. `` The night of the fourth was quite good, despite the millions of street lamps everywhere, which are a big problem to amateur astronomers.'' Although <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> discovered the asteroids they will be named by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The international society voted last year to name asteroid 3,698, discovered by another scientist, after <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> `` for his contribution to astronomy,'' <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said. Asteroids are thought to be the remnants of planets that were partly formed or destroyed in the early days of the solar system. The first asteroid, named <LOCATION> Ceres </LOCATION>, was discovered in 1801. At 621 miles in diameter, it is still the largest ever found. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said he believes his asteroids are about 10 miles wide.

 A lawsuit filed Monday alleges that the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has failed to develop national standards for discharging toxic pollution into public waterways as required by law. As a result, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court by the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and Public Citizen, millions of pounds of toxic wastes are unregulated. The lawsuit asks the federal courts to direct the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to develop a plan for limiting a broader range of toxic pollution than is covered by federal regulations. `` Over two-thirds of the industrial facilities that release toxics into our waterways are not covered by nationwide <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regulations, but by a weak system of site-specific permits,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based environmental organization. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenuta </PERSON> said the agency had no immediate comment on the lawsuit because officials have not seen it. The suit, using data filed by industry to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> on 1987 toxic emissions, said an estimated 70 million pounds of unregulated toxic wastes are released annually into surface waters and sewers from a variety of industries ranging from parmaceutical companies to mining, iron and steel and texile operations. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitzenstein </PERSON>, an attorney for Public Citizen, said many of those toxic releases come from companies that are in business to treat hazardous wastes. `` The hazardous waste treatment industry is perhaps the most astonishing example of an industry that escapes nationwide toxic pollution controls,'' <PERSON> Giltzenstein </PERSON> said. `` Ironically, these facilities are cleaning up polluted land and groundwater at hazardous waste sites, only to release equally dangerous wastes into our waters.'' The lawsuit alleges that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has failed to live up to requirements under the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to establish in a timely fashion a regulatory plan for controlling the discharge of hazardous waste into public waterways.

 Half of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 50,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> have left for home, slightly ahead of a schedule set in peace agreements signed last year by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, officials said Monday. In a ceremony at the capital's airport, the last 150 of the first 25,000 Cubans to leave the southwest African nation paraded past Angolan, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials to board Soviet-built transport planes. According to the accords signed Dec. 22, 1988, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 3,000 Cubans were to have left <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by April 1 and 25,000 by Nov. 1. All 50,000 are to be out by July 1, 1991. Brazilian Gen. <PERSON> Pericles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> said he thought the actual number of repatriated Cubans could be even higher than 25,000 due to differences in <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and Cuban counting methods. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force will leave <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> on Wednesday to inspect former Cuban bases below the 13th parallel that runs along <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s central highlands close to the <LOCATION> Benguela </LOCATION> railroad, <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON>, as leader of the force, said he would also travel south of the parallel Friday to check the bases. Following the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> accords, the pullout began in January when the first 3,000 troops left <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials repeatedly have reported the Cuban withdrawal proceeding on, or slightly ahead of, schedule. They verified the Cubans pulled back to north of the 15th parallel Aug. 1. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> agreed to the pullout in exchange for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s pledge to cease aid to the rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and allow <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to gain independence.

 Government-run broadcasting said Tuesday that peaceful demonstrations such as the huge anti-apartheid rally over the weekend have helped ease political tensions and assisted reforms. `` We thank the people for behaving within the norms of democratic society,'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON>, the police public relations chief said of the 70,000-member rally Sunday at a soccer stadium on the edge of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. It was the largest ever anti-government event, and virtually every aspect violated security laws. But authorities approved the event in advance and police maintained a low profile as <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders, released from prison Oct. 15, endorsed the organization's guerrilla campaign and called for increased economic sanctions against the white-run government. `` There is no doubt this event will go down in history as the most dramatic, most poignant, and perhaps the most politically significant since the start of the struggle for liberation,'' said the Sowetan, the nation's largest black-oriented daily newspaper. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has been outlawed since 1960, but Sunday's rally was the clearest signal yet that the government is willing to allow peaceful public activities by the organization. The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said it would be better to lift laws restricting political freedom than to enforce them selectively. `` The best thing for -LRB- the government -RRB- to do, if it is not going to apply the laws, is to do away with them,'' the editorial said. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> told government-run TV Sunday night that peaceful protest offers a needed outlet for those with political grievances. `` I do n't think we need to be afraid that these protests, which are monitored, will break into violence,'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Andries </PERSON> <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON>, head of the pro-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, called for an urgent session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to debate the government's relaxed stance toward protests. `` The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, under its own flag and that of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> alongside, is enjoying complete freedom to propagate its aims and ambitions and issues one ultimatum after the other to the government,'' <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON> said. `` The government's authority to maintain law and order and to enforce the laws of the land is being blatantly challenged,'' he added. Police spokesman Col. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said police were studying Sunday's rally to determine whether anyone should be prosecuted. However, police have made similar statements after several recent demonstrations and have not taken any action. When a magistrate approved Sunday's rally, he warned organizers not to promote the aims of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We refused,'' said <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramaphosa </PERSON>, a union leader and one of the main organizers. `` The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> lives. It is amongst us.'' The seven <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders freed unconditionally Oct. 15 appeared on a podium beneath huge banners of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and the South African Communist Party. Six of the seven had spent at least 25 years in prison. Deafening cheers erupted when the men, led by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, slowly circled the playing field behind an honor guard of 20 young militants, clad in khaki uniforms and marching in military style. `` ANC! <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>!'' shouted the crowd, many dressed in the movement's colors of green, black and gold <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said his movement would never abandon its guerrilla campaign unilaterally but would consider suspending violence and entering talks if the government freed all political prisoners, legalized the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and lifted the state of emergency. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who assumed power in August, has offered to negotiate a new constitution within five years that would extend political rights to blacks but protect white interests. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> wants a constitution that would establish a one-person, one-vote system.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> broke ground Monday for a memorial to slain police officers and said cop killers should pay `` the ultimate price'' for committing `` the ultimate crime.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drew loud applause from a large crowd that included hundreds of police officers, widows and other relatives of some of the 30,000 officers whose names will eventually be carved on granite walls at the memorial site. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prodded <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act quickly on the $ 1.2 billion anti-crime package he unveiled last May, including stiffer penalties for gun-related crimes, limits on semiautomatic weapons and no plea bargaining with those who used guns in violent crimes. `` It is time to act because these improvements are a vital part of our national drug strategy,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, adding, `` Before any more names are added to that wall, the protection you deserve should be added to the books.'' `` For cop killers, for those who commit the ultimate crime, I feel strongly that they should pay the ultimate price,'' said the president. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to vote later this year on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s crime package. The House is awaiting <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action before it takes up the measure. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who keeps in his desk the shield of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> rookie policeman, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, murdered last year while protecting a drug witness, said the toll from police killings `` rivals those of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s overseas wars.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the speech behind bullet-proof glass on a stage erected at the Judiciary Square site where the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial will be erected. It will consist of an oval, tree-lined `` pathway of remembrance'' on a three-acre site with the names of the slain police officers on a three-foot-high wall. Last year alone, 161 federal, state and local officers were killed in the line of duty. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it will be a tribute to `` the thin blue line that protects our nation from the evil within.'' He singled out several slain officers, from the first, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal killed in 1794 serving `` routine court papers'' in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Police Officer <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, killed in September 1988 by `` a drug-crazed gunman'' who invaded the school where she stood guard, to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Officer <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>, shot down last week while investigating a burglary. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>' partner, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaglowski </PERSON>, despite his own wounds, managed to kill <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>' slayer, who had taken three other lives that day. <PERSON> Jaglowski </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>, chairman of the memorial, in turning over four shovels of dirt for the actual groundbreaking. The $ 5 million memorial, authorized by a 1984 law unanimously passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, is being built with private contributions. So far, the non-profit group spearheading the drive has raised $ 4 million, including contributions from 400,000 individuals. In front row seats at the ceremony were <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, the former White House press secretary wounded in the 1981 attack on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, now a crusader for gun control. Among the VIPs on stage were former Attorney Gen. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said had `` stood strong and tall for law enforcement.''

 The toll from two earthquakes in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> reached at least 30 dead and 250 injured Monday, civil defense officials reported, and rescue teams continued searching for victims. The temblors struck 12 minutes apart Sunday evening, the first registering 6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and the second 4.8. Heaviest damage was reported in <LOCATION> Tipasa </LOCATION>, 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, and at <LOCATION> Churchell </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coastal town 60 miles west of the capital. Prime Minister <PERSON> Maloud </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamrouche </PERSON> and his ministers of health and interior toured those areas. Residents of <LOCATION> Nador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amar </PERSON> blocked roads to demand government aid. One demonstrator shouted: `` Be human! We are simply asking for help!'' Police used tear gas Monday afternoon to clear people off National Highway 11. One person was arrested. Protesters carried signs demanding tents, water and bread. Local officials said relief materials were being brought in as quickly as possible, but there was a severe shortage of ambulances, generators and other rescue equipment. In the village of <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> below <LOCATION> Chenoua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, their collapsing house killed five children of the <PERSON> Berkouk </PERSON> family _ <PERSON> Samia </PERSON>, 1; <PERSON> Darifa </PERSON>, 3; <PERSON> Brahim </PERSON>, 4; <PERSON> Naima </PERSON>, 7, and <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON>, 8. All but one of <PERSON> Nora </PERSON>'s houses were built of traditional mud bricks made of clay mixed with straw. The one exception was the only house not reduced to rubble. `` Many times we asked for construction material to build stronger houses,'' one resident said. `` Our appeals were ignored.'' Eighteen hours after the first temblor at 8:15 p.m. Sunday, relief supplies still had not reached some areas. Many people spent Sunday night outside, in gardens, public squares or schoolyards. Some resident of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> panicked. <PERSON> Samia </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoudi </PERSON>, 17, jumped from the balcony of her fourth-floor apartment and was taken to a hospital with a broken hip. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Josephe </PERSON>, a Frenchwoman hospitalized in <LOCATION> Tipasa </LOCATION> with a fractured shoulder, said: `` In a few seconds the house collapsed, and I found myself in the hospital,'' Four deaths in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> were attributed to the quakes and some buildings were damaged. An earthquake that hit <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Asnam </PERSON>, 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, in 1980 killed an estimated 2,500 people. The open-ended <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph, and each increase of one number means 10 times greater strength. A quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas. A 1988 earthquake in the same region affected Sunday measured 5.4 and injured 60 people.

 There was no parade for baseball's world champions on Monday, just a muted rally in which the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION>' triumph mingled with memories of this city's recent tragedy. More than 4,000 fans of the A's, who completed a four-game sweep of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, joined in the rally in <LOCATION> Jack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. It began with music and a flag procession. A moment of silence planned for victims of the recent earthquake was forgotten in the excitement. `` The longer you have to wait for something, the more it means to you,'' said A's Manager <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Russa </PERSON>. `` Nobody likes the reason we had to wait so long to be the world champions, but I know it means a great deal to all of us.'' Each of the players, standing in front of a banner that read, `` <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s World Serious,'' spoke briefly to the crowd. A few minutes earlier, workers clearing battered vehicles from a crumpled section of Interstate 880 removed the car in which the last survivor of the freeway's collapse, longshoreman Buck Helm, was trapped for four days. Helm remained in serious condition but continued to show slow improvement, said a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Thirty-nine people died in the freeway collapse. There had been plans for a more traditional parade and ceremony at City Hall if the A's won the World Series. But those plans were canceled after the 7.1 magnitude quake struck Oct. 17, a half-hour before the originally scheduled third game at Candlestick Park. The game was postponed until 10 days later, and the A's quickly ended the Series by winning the third and fourth games at <LOCATION> Candlestick </LOCATION>. Many of the buildings along the planned parade route remain roped off, still too dangerous to enter, and the ornate City Hall is so badly damaged it may never reopen. The rally, though small and tame compared with the parade after the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers' Super Bowl victory last January, signaled another step toward recovery by the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. `` People now are trying to find hope,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> before his sermon Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Glide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` Some people do n't want to face the trauma, they do n't want to face the pain I'm hoping this will be a learning experience. This is a tremendous opportunity for the city to be what's never been before, a new <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a city that is more loving and equal and kind.'' Bay area companies, hoping to bring back nervous tourists and conventioneers, are mounting an advertising campaign to show the world that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> still stand. `` We've had our natural disaster, we do n't want an economic disaster,'' said <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, vice president for marketing for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which is kicking off its pitch Thursday. Hyatt, which owns 10 hotels in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, is launching a similar campaign in six newspapers across the country starting Tuesday. `` We're doing a lot because the world thinks we've tumbled into the bay. We're trying to project the image that the city is not in rubble,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, general manager of the Hyatt-Regency in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, a coalition of business groups called <ORGANIZATION> Celebrate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> hired three ad agencies to put together a campaign to show that the city is returning to normal. The Port of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> also is running ads headlined `` Oakland Can Take It'' in trade magazines. `` We've taken some licks, but we're on our way back,'' the ad says. Recovery efforts also are continuing strong with donations from around the country. A big truck rig carrying disaster relief supplies donated by the people of <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, was unloaded in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION> for quake victims in that city, the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastic </ORGANIZATION> and Reconstructive Surgeons, holding its annual meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, asked each of the 2,000 attending doctors to donate $ 100 to help quake victims. Traffic remains a major problem that may be getting worse, with I-880 partly closed and the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> still closed for repair. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> officials said the heavy traffic last week and over the weekend may be mild compared to what is to come. Officials calculated that just 80 percent of regular commuters went back to work last week. `` We expect them all to go back this week,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Saville </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION>. `` The first couple of days will be a true indication of what we're dealing with.''

<HEAD>Bush Signs Farmer Relief Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday signed legislation that gives a break to farmers who are growing substitute crops on land where drought destroyed or damaged earlier plantings. The measure eases restrictions that were part of a previous federal farm-disaster aid package. The revision protects winter wheat and cotton farmers who otherwise might have been denied disaster payments for their lost crops under an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plan _ even though the producers expect to earn little or no profit on replacement crops such as grain sorghum or soybeans. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, trying to prevent farmers from reaping double benefits, has been planning to deduct 75 percent of the gross value of any replacement crop from the disaster payment a farmer would have otherwise received for losses on his first crop. Under the bill, approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week, that system would be modified. Farmers would have no payment deductions if the replacement crops failed to produce more than 50 percent of the county average yield for the second crop. But if the yield exceeded 50 percent of average yield, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s formula for deductions would kick in and be applied only to the portion of the crop that exceeded the 50 percent mark. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s initial plan, even farmers who had replanted only a few acres would have to wait until harvesting their second crop before obtaining disaster benefits for damage to the first crop. That provision was canceled by the new legislation.

 Six American members of a medical missionary team detained in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> six days ago for illegally entering the country have been released, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> government had said the six were traveling with a Briton linked to a group spying for anti-government rebels. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the group sponsor, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, described its mission as providing medical assistance to refugees from <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said she was n't certain how the group arrived in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. They were detained last week near the border with <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the six Americans were in good condition and were offered assistance during a meeting in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials. Officials for the <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, Calif.-based <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> said the Briton accompanying the Americans was a guide. <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Courson </PERSON>, the group's director of medical services, identified the six Americans as: Dr. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; Dr. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Leist </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Bremerton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, a dentist from <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; and paramedics <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stroudsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. The official <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> news agency AIM quoted the foreign ministry as identifying the other two group members as South African missionary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bezuidenhout </PERSON> and British citizen <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The news agency said <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> had been turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The South African <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bezuidenhout </PERSON> was freed Monday. `` <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> runs a far-right, quasi-religious outfit called Frontline Fellowship, which is openly supportive of South African-backed bandit organizations such as <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and the MNR in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>,'' AIM said. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON>, an Australian missionary who served 17 months of a 10 -LCB- - year prison sentence after confessing to entering <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> illegally, said after his 1988 trial that right-wing American preachers were flown into guerrilla-controlled parts of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, via <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, after contacts with <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Derek </PERSON>, said Sunday night on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s state-run television, that the detained group had `` strayed across the border into <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> amongst the villages. `` They were n't there on a mission of war or involved in any spying capacity.

 State police searched the charred rubble and remaining buildings at the <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> state prison Monday looking for five inmates missing after a two-night rampage last week. Hundreds of state prisoners will be shifted to federal prison to make room for inmates from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where the riots left nearly half the prison gutted or damaged by fire and 133 people injured, officials said Monday. Corrections Department spokesman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said heavy equipment was being used to move debris from the prison while state police and security personnel conducted building-by-building sweeps for the missing imates. `` We're not going to rule out anything, but we feel it's very unlikely anyone escaped,'' said <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadeaux </PERSON>, a department spokeswoman. `` It could be a paperwork thing. It could be that they're hiding in the utility tunnels. At this point we do n't have any reason to believe that we're going to find bodies. We just do n't know,'' she added. Officials said there were no known breaches of the prison's double ring of fences, which have been under heavy security since violence erupted Wednesday At the Capitol, Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> named a three-member commission to review the prison siege and the effectiveness of the state's response. `` I am determined to get to the bottom of what happened at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>,'' the governor said. Last Wednesday, 47 people were injured and eight hostages taken during a seven-hour rampage that erupted after an inmate assaulted a prison worker. A second night of rioting began Thursday evening. Five hostages were released Friday morning after state police stormed the prison. At that time, officials said there were no reported deaths and no missing inmates. Six inmates and four prison staffers remained hospitalized Monday. At the prison, about 1,340 inmates were being kept in cells while hundreds of others were being held outdoors on the prison grounds. By Saturday, 744 inmates had been transferred to other state prisons because of the shortage of cells, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said Monday. At the time of the riots, the prison had a population of about 2,600, about 45 percent over capacity. The governor met Monday with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, both R-Pa., who said federal prisons had agreed to take 700 state inmates on a temporary basis to help ease crowding Authorities will also be investigating a disturbance at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> prison, where inmates seized control of a cellblock at <LOCATION> Holmesburg </LOCATION> Prison for about four hours Saturday night. Guards recaptured the city prison's `` I'' Block, fighting with nightsticks as the prisoners fought back with homemade weapons. During the <LOCATION> Holmesburg </LOCATION> riot, inmates could be heard shouting `` <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>.'' After the riot was put down, nine inmates, three with head wounds, were admitted to hospitals. Three guards received severe injuries, including multiple broken bones and deep cuts, but none was admitted. On Oct. 23, 29 prison staffers and 19 inmates were injured during a three-hour uprising at the state prison at <LOCATION> Huntingdon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>.

 Most of the nation's hospitals have pulled the plug on offers to X-ray Halloween goodies, saying the once popular way to detect pins and needles is too costly and is ineffective in preventing poisoning. `` It cost a fortune,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Soloway </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` Someone calculated the cost in health care dollars, and it's an enormous amount of money nationwide,'' Ms. <PERSON> Soloway </PERSON> said `` It's money that's probably not well spent `` If candy is going to be tampered with, there's any number of ways of doing it,'' she said. `` X-rays can only detect foreign objects, especially metallic objects.

But some officials said hospitals are just providing parents with a false sense of security. `` We were concerned that parents who brought candy in to the emergency room to have it X-rayed and were told that there was nothing in it were led to believe it was safe,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cabell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>.

At least we're giving the child a chance,'' <ORGANIZATION> Blackburn </ORGANIZATION> said. `` In the past, we have found different things, pins stuck into fruit and candy,'' he said. `` We caution the people when we do the candy for the kids. We caution them that we ca n't detect any poison.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cabell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> examined youngsters' treats until two years ago, when the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> suggested hospitals no longer X-ray candy. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, head nurse of <ORGANIZATION> Cabell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency department, said experts can detect foreign bodies by X-rays only 14 percent of the time, `` which means most of the time they could n't detect it even if it were there.'' Ms. <PERSON> Soloway </PERSON> said it's important that parents inspect each piece of candy themselves rather than depending on X-rays at hospitals. While the X-raying process often disrupted hospital routines, it was offered with good intentions and an eye on public relations, said <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvit </PERSON>. But by last year, concerns about liability outstripped the benefits, she said. `` The problem we saw is that parents would take the candy to get it X-rayed and then give the kids the candy and assume it was safe,'' she said. While parents still have concerns about tampered candy, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> said the number of reported incidents is low. `` It's not a big problem. Rumors start and the media gets hold of it, and it's usually just some individual that wanted attention,'' she said. `` Falls are the number one cause of injury because of masks, running up and down stairs ... tripping over their costumes,'' she said.

<HEAD>House Approves $231 Million For FCC</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The House on Monday authorized $ 231.3 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> over the next two years, while ordering the agency to adopt a global perspective in regulating the telecommunications industry. On a voice vote, the chamber gave the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> $ 109.8 million in spending authority for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1, and $ 121.5 million for fiscal 1991. That was an increase from $ 99.6 million in 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month authorized $ 109.8 million for the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in 1990, but only $ 119.8 million for 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday approved a fiscal 1990 appropriations measure containing the $ 109.8 million, which is the amount the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had sought. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was expected to act on a companion appropriation Tuesday. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> needed the extra money to cover costs of moving and consolidating agency offices in 1991 and to hire more people and facilities Rep. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON>, R-Calif., said `` It is money the agency sorely needs. The House on Monday also authorized $ 29.3 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for 1990 and 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> authorization was amended last week by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to require the agency to consider what impacts its rulings may have on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade. The amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, was spurred by a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> decision last month to urge its 12 member nations to broadcast television programs made in the market at least 51 percent of the time, `` where practicable.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said that without giving the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> increased authority in matters of international trade, the amendment was a `` strong signal'' that until foreign telecommunications markets are completely open to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be watching its own interests carefully. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said the measure gives the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> no new authority in trade matters, but it will tell `` the agency and the rest of the world that we're serious about this international telecommunications competition.''

 Police using tear gas and clubs dispersed 1,000 ethnic Albanians Monday who were protesting the trial of the former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, a southern province wracked by ethnic violence. <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, the ex-party leader, and 14 other ethnic Albanians are accused of `` counterrevolutionary activities'' and opposing constitutional changes that limited the province's autonomy. Death is the maximum penalty on conviction of the charges, which include inciting ethnic Albanians to riot and strike. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>'s co-defendants are officials and workers at a zinc and lead mine where a strike occurred in March <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, with a predominantly ethnic <LOCATION> Albanian </LOCATION> population, is a province in the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. For generations the <LOCATION> Serbs </LOCATION> and ethnic Albanians have accused each other of discrimination. The trial was adjourned soon after it opened Monday as defense lawyers asked for a change of venue. The lawyers said a fair trial is impossible in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> because none of its courts could be considered impartial. Police fired tear gas from armored vehicles and wielded truncheons to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators in <LOCATION> Podujevo </LOCATION>, 20 miles from <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. There also were anti-Serb protests in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>. Before the confrontation in <LOCATION> Podujevo </LOCATION>, demonstrators marched through the town chanting `` We Want Freedom'' and `` Azem! Azem!'' and trying to break through police lines. <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> is former party leader <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>'s first name. Many demonstrators were students and some wore scarves over their faces to hide their identities. Small groups of protesters continued to roam the streets following the main clash with police, hurling stones, breaking shop windows and driving away Yugoslav and foreign journalists. Some used cars and trash cans to erect street barricades. There were no reports of injuries but police were seen taking away several people. In <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, police battled groups of protesters throughout the city, including hundreds of students gathered around their school dormitories. Police used tear gas in the pedestrian zone in the downtown area, driving people screaming in panic down side streets. At the start of Monday's session in the <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION> courthouse, defense lawyers demanded that presiding Judge <PERSON> Ismet </PERSON> <PERSON> Emra </PERSON> and prosecutor <PERSON> Spasone </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamfirovic </PERSON> be removed on grounds of bias. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, 42, described the proceedings as a `` show trial staged with clear political goals'' and claimed he was the victim of a plot by archrival <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. Until his arrest in March, <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> publicly opposed <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s efforts to increase control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, an autonomous province in which 85 percent of the 1.9 million people are ethnic Albanians At least 24 people were killed in the March violence. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> leadership argued the changes were necessary because of alleged harassment of the Serbian minority in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, the heartland of ancient <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. Some analysts call the <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> case <PERSON> Yugoslaviaq </PERSON>'s most important political trial since that of <PERSON> Milovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Djilas </PERSON> in the 1950s. <PERSON> Djilas </PERSON>, once heir apparent to the late President <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, spent nine years in jail for publicly criticizing the communist system and <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s rule. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> declared to the court Monday: `` The campaign to liquidate me has lasted a long time ... and was conducted by <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morina </PERSON>,'' the current <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> party chief. Police cordoned off the courthouse and only 80 people, most of them journalists or relatives of the accused, were allowed inside. Several Western diplomats acting as human rights monitors were among those denied access. The trial has been denounced in the liberal Yugoslav republics of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> as a Serbian bid to intimidate ethnic Albanian dissent in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. Slovenian and Croatian members of the national collective presidency and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Presidium have urged both bodies to demand the charges be dropped.

<HEAD>Transportation Secretary Says Bill Would Give Him Too Much Authority</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said Monday he does n't want the power over airline takeovers that a bill pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would give him. `` This is a piece of expansive legislation that no person like myself who favors deregulation could support,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said in an interview. The House has scheduled to take up Tuesday the Air Carrier Securities Act, which would require the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to block purchase of 15 percent or more of an airline if the sale threatened to hinder safety, reduce competition, break up the carrier or put it under foreign control. On a related matter, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he and financial experts had serious reservations about the proposed takeover of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent company, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, before the deal fell through. But he denied any role in collapse of the buyout plan, which Wall Street analysts say triggered the Oct. 13 drop in the stock market. `` The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> transaction fell for one reason and one reason only _ it was not sound financially,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. Collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> takeover bid by its unions and management, with backing from several banks and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, followed announcement of an agreement <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> reached with <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> to scale down foreign participation in <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent company, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The department concluded that the original deal put <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in a position to control Northwest. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said his decision to modify the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> takeover was `` thoroughly coordinated with senior officials of the White House.'' Responding to reports that he had been criticized for the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> action by others in the administration, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, `` Anybody who says that I did not keep the White House informed fully as to what was going on prior to making those decisions just is n't informed.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> declined, however, to describe any conversations he had with other administration officials over his <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> action. The airline takeover bill pending in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has had strong bipartisan support, passing the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> 23-5. A similar measure passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> but has not yet come up on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. The bills were prompted by a series of takeover moves in the airline industry, including the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> deals and the aborted attempt by developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to buy <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The decline in the stock market led <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to withdraw his $ 7.5 billion plan, which was opposed by <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> management. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and his deputy, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Chao </PERSON>, both have sent letters to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> opposing the takeover bill, although <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> had indicated in earlier committee testimony that there may be advantages to giving him power to approve takeovers rather than merely review them after they are consummated. `` A preapproval process of existing law might be cleaner than trying to unwrap a transaction; one can argue that,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said Monday, adding that when he made a similar statement before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he may have been misinterpreted as supporting takeover legislation. But he said the bills before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> go too far. `` It goes far beyond the factors that under existing law I'm to take into consideration,'' he said. Current law requires the department to review airline aquisitions after they take place to ensure that carriers are financially fit to operate safely and that a foreign entity does not control them. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the proposed legislation would require him to assess the impact of the deal on competition and to look at labor provisions. `` That smacks of reregulation. It probably is reregulation and is inappropriate in a deregulated environment,'' he said. `` The point is, I dont think I need it,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. `` I think there are other ways I can do it.''

<HEAD>Charlotte Begins Citywide Cleanup of Hugo Debris</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An army of workers assembled Monday for the first citywide cleanup since the remnants of Hurricane Hugo struck this inland city more than a month ago. Officials said the crews were prepared to stay on the job seven days a week for at least five weeks to clean up the tons of debris left behind by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>. `` They'll work until we get out from under the emergency,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, operations supervisor for street maintainence for the city of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. Employees will have to be released for vacations, he said. `` But we're going to keep it running until it's all finished,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. The only day off for employees in the next several weeks will be Thanksgiving Day, he said. Hurricane Hugo hit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland on Sept. 22, dealing its strongest blow to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> By the time it reached <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, its winds had slowed from 135 mph to a steady 70 mph and it had been downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm. Still, it was powerful enough to uproot thousands of trees, knock down power lines and flood low-lying areas. Three people died in the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> area and preliminary estimates put the damage at $ 300 million. A thorough, citywide cleanup was delayed while local officials waited for federal damage estimates to be made, and for bids to come in from various contractors who would do the cleanup. The workers who assembled to begin the job Monday came from 80 of the state's 100 counties and found a city still choked with storm debris. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said there was enough debris left to fill about 160,000 dump trucks, each carrying 10 cubic yards of trash. `` It's going real well,'' he said. `` This morning it was kind of chaotic. But we've got them all together now and from now on, it should be a routine type thing and we should have no more trouble.'' About 300 state workers in about 200 <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> trucks arrived Sunday. They'll help about 250 city workers and employees of 16 private companies. Storm debris is still causing problems in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> as well. Parents there have been urged not to send their youngsters trick-or-treating on Halloween, for fear that debris on curbsides might create a safety hazard. `` We do n't think it's safe for children to go trick-or-treating with all the debris on city streets. It's safer for parents to have Halloween parties,'' police Sgt. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said.

 Hundreds of thousands of East Germans marched for democracy Monday night, the eve of a trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by new leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> for talks with the Soviet bloc's champion of reform, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Official media said about 300,000 people rallied in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, a city of 650,000; at least 50,000 in <LOCATION> Halle </LOCATION>; 40,000 in <LOCATION> Schwerin </LOCATION>; more than 20,000 in <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadt </PERSON>; and 5,000 in <LOCATION> Poessneck </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> sources in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said 3,000 pro-reform activists demonstrated in the capital. <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> activists told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone many of the marchers there demanded that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> give up its monopoly on power. They said the protesters wanted free elections, freedom to travel and legalization of opposition groups. Political parties now are recognized only if they align themselves with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said people in all the cities spoke out for a free press, and those in <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadt </PERSON> carried banners reading `` Democracy Now.'' <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> reaffirmed the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s pre-eminence Monday, telling military academy graduates it was `` at the head of qualitative changes going on in society.'' ADN reported he would leave for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can learn much from reforms promoted by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Soviet president. That is a major departure from the contention of his 77-year-old predecessor, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, that no changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s orthodox regime were necessary <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> replaced <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, his mentor, as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief Oct. 18. Weeks of demonstrations for reform have accompanied the flight to the West of tens of thousands of East Germans. The largest protests in the nation's 40-year history have taken place in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, another one last week involving 300,000 people. In his speech at the academy, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said `` the most decisive factor'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was `` the unity and cohesiveness of the party, without which the unity of our people can not be achieved.'' Opposition groups say the party's leading role must be open to debate. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> said it had joined others in demanding the development of a `` democratic consensus.'' The organization said it would become an active opposition political party by next May. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> appears more open to change than <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, but many activists are skeptical, feeling party leaders will block any reform that challenges their monopoly on power. He has set what he calls `` a new course'' for the country, promising freer travel abroad and declaring amnesty for demonstrators, people who have fled the country illegally and those who were caught while trying to do so. A leader of the officially recognized <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the `` political structure no longer corresponds to the will of the people'' or they `` would n't be taking to the streets and there would n't be movements like Neues Forum -LRB- New Forum -RRB- and Demokratie Jetzt -LRB- Democracy Now -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogisch </PERSON> suggested in a commentary in his party newspaper, <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgen </PERSON>, that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leading role should to be earned, not dictated. <PERSON> Bogisch </PERSON> said communism was not an issue, but the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership's policies were `` now a matter of debate.'' `` Those who were responsible for the stagnation will have to take responsibility for it,'' he declared. The Liberal Democrats have been at the forefront of efforts to create more political pluralism within the system. Under East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s constitution, all recognized political parties are aligned with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Liberal Democrats have said parties should have more independence. Leaders of the nation's government-aligned trade union federation met jon Monday to discuss a confidence vote called for by its leader, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>. He requested the vote on his leadership after young members accused the union of serving only government interests. No decision was announced Monday and the union meeting was continued until Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported. A mass rally Sunday in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, organized by local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials to discuss reform, attracted 20,000 people. It became an emotional forum, with speakers demanding that party leaders account for to account for a host of alleged mistakes and misdeeds. The crowd often booed and jeered officials.

 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials said Monday that candidates for top medical jobs will not be rejected because of their views on abortion or other political issues. Medical and scientific experts have been concerned recently that an ideological `` litmus test'' centering on abortion and related issues was prompting qualified candidates to withdraw from consideration for top federal jobs, including the directorship of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. In a speech Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he took these concerns to the White House last week. The administration has agreed, he said, that people being considered for jobs below the level of assistant secretary do not have to pass an ideological test. `` It has been our policy that standards of scientific and administrative excellence and leadership prevail in the selection process'' for scientific jobs, including heads of <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, he said. However, he said, it was `` necessary and proper'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to use the litmus test to fill positions at the level of assistant secretary and above to select people who share his views. Conservative right-to-life groups have pressed the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to appoint to positions at <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> people who share the president's opposition to abortion. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said it was particularly important that the head of <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> back the president's abortion stance because `` a director who is inclined to do so can undermine -LRB- the administration's -RRB- policy'' on such things as research using fetal tissue. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does n't look into this, I'm sure some senators will at the appropriate time,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings on a nominee for <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> director. Medical and scientific experts have been concerned over reports that at least one candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> post withdrew after he got a call from White House officials asking his position on abortion and fetal tissue research. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, chancellor of <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, reportedly told the caller that if that was all they wanted to know about him, he was not interested in the job. <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> has declined to answer questions on the subject. In a statement, he has said he is not interested in leaving <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and `` any conjecture about my candidacy, possible conversations with <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> representatives and others ... are simply irrelevant.'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will continue exploring the political views of candidates for policy-making jobs in the health field. `` We'll still certainly ask them for their position on abortion, fetal tissue research, AIDS, the whole range of issues that they would have to be directing federal policy on,'' he said. `` But for those jobs that essentially technical, below the assistant secretary level, the answer is no.'' He said the surgeon general's job `` would be a policy-making job. We certainly would want to know that they support the president's position.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidate for surgeon general, <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Novello </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, was asked her views on abortion before being selected by the president, officials have said. Earlier this month, when the reports about <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> surfaced and it became clear that <PERSON> Novello </PERSON> was in line to be nominated, administration officials said the abortion question was being asked of candidates for most jobs at <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, though that was not necessarily the deciding factor. Scientists and medical experts said they feared that the volatile issue would further politicize top government medical jobs like the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> post, which remains unfilled.

 A walkout persisted for a sixth day at <LOCATION> Vargashor </LOCATION> coal mine Monday and activists at eight other mines in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> said they would initiate support strikes on Nov. 1, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Strikers at Vargashor put down their tools last Wednesday to protest what they called government failure to make good on promises of improved economic and social conditions that ended a walkout in July. Other strike leaders said they would start holding two-hour `` pre-emptive'' strikes Wednesday to pressure the government into granting promised benefits. About 18,000 miners work in the <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> region, above the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>. Workers at the eight other mines also struck on Wednesday, but returned to work 1 -LCB- days later. A regional court ruled Saturday that the strikes violated a law passed by the national Supreme Soviet on Oct. 9, but no indication emerged as to what penalties might be imposed. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> city strike committee plans to appeal the decision to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Federation </LOCATION>. It also quoted <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobrusev </PERSON>, a spokesman for the regional strike committee, as saying his committee `` supported the miners' demands and the tactics of pressure by pre-emptive strikes offered by the miners' strike committees.'' However, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, the committee did not approve of the full strike at <LOCATION> Vargashor </LOCATION> and said extended walkouts should be avoided.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s lawyer accused the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Monday of giving an `` off-the-wall'' reason for not paying <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s legal expenses from a congressional investigation A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said it was just an interpretation of law. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> twice refused to answer questions when he appeared before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, which has been investigating allegations of political favoritism at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which he headed during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He contended that because the hearings related to his tenure at the department, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> should pay his fees. The department forwarded <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s request to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for a ruling on whether the former secretary qualified for reimbursement under the regulations. Two weeks later, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> replied that it had no responsibility to represent <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and therefore would not rule on whether he qualified for reimbursement. The department said it was up to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> whether to represent <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> or pay his fees. `` It's a hot potato,'' said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>. `` HUD hands off to Justice, Justice hands off back to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> defied a plain reading of government regulations when it determined it was n't responsible for expenses <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> incurred during the subcommittee investigation. `` I could n't believe that of several potential grounds that perhaps they might have used to justify not paying it, the one they used seemed so off-the-wall,'' <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said `` our decision was based on the civil division's interpretation of the law. The lawyers took a look at it and that's their decision.'' <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> stretched hard to formulate an interpretation of the regulations that allowed it to avoid making a politically difficult decision on <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s request. The regulation states that current and former federal officials `` may be provided representation in civil and congressional proceedings and in state criminal proceedings ... when the actions for which representation is requested reasonably appear to have been performed within the scope of the employee's employment and providing representation would otherwise be in the interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` One would think that clearly, on it's face we are eligible,'' <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said. `` And then they have to exercise their discretion as to whether or not they want to pay it.'' But in an Oct. 25 letter to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, Deputy Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bransdorfer </PERSON> said that legal representation by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` is available only in situations where the employee is subject to civil or state criminal proceedings as a result of actions taken within the normal scope of that employee's authority `` If there are no such underlying proceedings then representation is not available,'' <PERSON> Bransdorfer </PERSON> said. There are no civil or state criminal proceedings against <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Bransdorfer </PERSON>'s determination, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> said it was recommending that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s request be denied.

 Trying to get control of a sticky situation, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Turnpike is eschewing gum. Chewing gum is n't sold anywhere on the road's 309 miles _ especially in the clean new rest stations that dot the length of the turnpike. `` So many times, the gum winds up on the sidewalk, on the floors, under the tables, in the carpet,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Butch </PERSON>, the manager of the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> rest station. `` That's the reason.'' The new stations opened in September, but the gum ban has been in effect for two years, ever since the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> took control of turnpike restaurants and rest stations. Not everyone is happy with the restriction. Highway Patrol Lt. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Moan </PERSON> stocks the glove compartment of his cruiser with gum and packs his own stash when he goes to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, which has also banned gum sales. `` I'm going to have to become a gumshoe on this, and stick to it,'' he said, not apologizing for the pun.

<HEAD>White House Status Quo as Republicans Search for Compromise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Republicans frustrated by a lack of guidance from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> searched Monday for a compromise on raising the minimum wage in the hope of avoiding a partisan fight as an election year looms. The White House did n't publicly rule out a compromise, but said that for now it stood by its offer to raise the hourly minimum wage from $ 3.35 to $ 4.25 by January 1992 _ a year later than the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal due for a vote Wednesday. `` We are not changing our position at this point,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> is discussing the issue with congressional leaders, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But even <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> said the White House was doing little more than listening, and it appeared the administration was losing the support of some conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans who helped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> win a veto battle on the issue earlier this year. One of those conservative Democrats, Rep. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, said it appeared the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had abandoned thoughts of striking a deal. `` It sounds like they're digging in their heals again,'' he said. `` Picking another fight like this is causing a lot of us to question their sincerity because a deal is within reach.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said the discussions were continuing, but added: `` I do n't know how fruitful they are. Even an administration official close to the negotations complained of `` a lack of focus'' from the White House that had `` left dangling'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership. The Republicans had hoped to strike a compromise to avoid another veto fight, a potential issue in 1990 congressional elections. Because of the White House position, the Republican leadership was mulling a number of proposals of its own, with a whip count planned for Tuesday likely to determine the final shape of the measure it will offer as an alternative to the Democrats' plan. The Democrats also planned a head count, and were mulling changes designed to win back enough conservative Democrats to override a second <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto. Even the administration official said the Democratic leadership was within reach of winning a veto-proof majority in the House. `` Some of the votes we got last time we got with the message very clear that it was ` this time and this time only,''' said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. `` Right now it's probably five or six votes either way. The current bill would increase the minimum wage to $ 3.80 on Jan. 1 and to $ 4.25 on Jan. 1, 1991. It also would allow workers with fewer than two months job experience to be paid a subminimum wage. <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> and other conservative Democrats want the two 45-cent increases pushed back to April 1, 1990, and April 1, 1991, and the `` subminimum'' period extended to three or four months. `` That would make a big difference to several members,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has insisted that to get his signature a minimum wage bill also would have to allow employers to pay all new workers a subminimum for up to six months regardless or prior job experience. Democrats have said they would never accept such language. In addition to next year's elections, two other factors have strengthened the Democrats' hand. The $ 4.25-an-hour target is more acceptable to many conservative Democrats than the $ 4.55 level in the measure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed. Also, the fight over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attempt to cut the capital gains tax has allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership to shape the issue as one of rich vs. poor.

 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> are going into secret arbitration to end a dispute arising from French sinking of the Rainbow Warrior at <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION> and a settlement is expected by Saturday, diplomats said. The Rainbow Warrior yacht was sent by <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> to lead a flotilla protesting <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> nuclear testing in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. French agents mined the ship July 10, 1985. The Rainbow Warrior sank and a Portuguese-born Dutch photographer who was aboard was killed. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said arbitration before a tribunal begins Tuesday. They said they expect the arbitration to be wrapped up by the weekend, but the decision will not be announced until later. The tribunal met on Monday but only to discuss procedural matters, said a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> official, speaking privately. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> violated a 1986 agreement meditated by Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> by letting two French agents convicted in the bombing leave detention before their terms ended. Uruguayan law professor <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiminez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Arechaga </PERSON> heads the panel, which also consists of French appointee <PERSON> Jean-Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bredin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> appointee Sir <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>. Attorney-General <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, the former prime minister, will lead <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s legal team. The two French secret agents who sank the ship, <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Mafart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Prieur </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to arson and manslaughter in November 1985 and were sentenced to 10-year prison terms by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> court. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> later mediated a settlement under which <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> paid <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> $ 7 million in compensation, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> agreed to commute the prison terms if the two agents were detained on a French atoll until the end of 1989. In 1987, however, <PERSON> Mafart </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, complaining of a stomach ailment. In 1988, Ms. <PERSON> Prieur </PERSON> went home because she was pregnant. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> flew both agents home and both received promotions on their return. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> protested and wants the two returned to custody.

<HEAD>Earl Of Balfour Says Israel Must Keep Present Boundaries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAIFA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Earl of <PERSON> Balfour </PERSON>, whose granduncle wrote a declaration supporting establishment of a Jewish national home in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, said Monday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must keep its present `` protectable'' boundaries. <PERSON> Balfour </PERSON> is in this northern port for a symposium on the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which opens Tuesday. The declaration is a major document in the history of the Zionist movement and in the history of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s establishment. `` Lawrence of Arabia promised to the Arabs that every country will keep what she fought for but I did not find any evidence that there was any <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country that fought on the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> valley,'' he told a reporter. `` Therefore when it comes to the present boundaries of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including what's inside, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has to keep and protect and develop her boundaries ... because these boundaries are protectable,'' <PERSON> Balfour </PERSON> said. `` You fought for this country and it belongs to you.'' His reference was to T.E. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, who rallied Arabs to fight on the side of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in World War I. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s former prime minister, <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, was invited to attend the symposium but instead sent a letter, saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would remember the <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> as `` a turning point in the history of the Jewish people.'' However, he accused <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of changing the document's meaning over the years, focusing on `` the Land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> instead of the Land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as home for the Jewish people ... when millions of Jews cried for a homeland.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was created in 1948 after more than a half-century of efforts by Zionist leaders to establish a sovereign nation as a homeland for Jews. Begin, 76, referred to the Zionist draft of the document that called for reconstituting <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> `` as the National Home of the Jewish people.'' The Nov. 2, 1917, declaration written in the form of a letter to the president of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> stated that `` His Majesty's Government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.'' Begin became prime minister in 1977 and resigned abruptly in August 1983. Aides said then that he was depressed over the death of his wife and over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s protracted involvement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> following its June 1982 invasion. He has lived mostly in seclusion since then.

We are going to take very much into account the decision of President <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>.'' Back in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> was asked if his comments meant he would try to mediate the Nicaraguan dispute. `` I do n't see that because it should be the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government directly'' he said, referring to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s support of the rebels. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> stunned the other leaders at the Costa Rican celebrations when he announced his Sandinista government may end a unilateral cease-fire in the war with the Contras. He accused the rebels of violating the accord signed in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, on Aug. 7 by himself and four other Central American presidents. The accords call for free elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government says will be held in February, and demobilization of the Contras by Dec. 5 Most of the estimated 11,000 rebels operate out of bases in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Japan Joins International Ban on Ivory Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which buys more ivory than any other country, said Monday it would join a ban on the ivory trade that is intended to protect African elephants. The ban was adopted Oct. 17 at a meeting of the 91-nation Convention on Trade in Endangered Species and is to remain in effect at least until 1992. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had until Jan. 18 to decide whether to file an appeal, which would allow it to continue trading ivory with other countries that did the same or with the more than 60 nations outside the accord. <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsujimoto </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office acknowledged that international attention on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as the world's main ivory consumer had played a role in the decision He also told reporters the decision did not necessarily mean <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was out of the market permanently, and that it `` may import if the circumstances in the world change.'' If the elephant is removed from the endangered species list, he said, `` the story will be different.'' <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> have objected to the ban on grounds their elephant herds are not endangered and they depend on ivory sales to finance successful conservation. By filing for exemptions, they may continue trade in ivory with other countries that do not accept the ban. A recent census estimated <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> now has about 600,000 elephants, fewer than half the total of a decade ago. About 30,000 people in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are employed in the ivory industry, which carves elephant tusks into ornaments, jewelry and personal signature seals. <PERSON> Tsujimoto </PERSON> said some might have to find other jobs eventually, but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has enough ivory in stock to last about two years. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> regularly has taken about 40 percent of the world's ivory exports. Imports totaled 106 tons in 1988 and 143 tons in 1987. It is to be host of the next meeting of the convention, in April 1992. <PERSON> Tsujimoto </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would like to study aid to African countries for better management of elephant populations. `` We are deeply concerned about the rapid decline in the number of elephants over the last 10 years,'' he said. `` We believe drastic measures should be taken to prevent further decline in the number and seek proper protection of the animals.'' In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, up to 400 ivory traders and carvers marched through downtown streets Monday to protest the ban. <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kowloon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ivory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said about 4,000 people worked in the industry in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.

 The <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> confidant who is now Pravda's editor met the foreign press Monday and made himself the target, a definite change at a paper that has bashed imperialists mercilessly for generations. Asked how he will stop a sharp decline in readership in President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s era of glasnost, or openness, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> said: `` We shall not seek to increase circulation at all costs.'' Although he offered some ideas for enlivening the gray columns _ interviews with members of the ruling Politburo, for instance _ the 60-year-old editor seemed to hold weak commitment by today's Communists as responsible as the party daily's content for its flagging fortunes `` I can ask the question even more directly: Do we need more genuine Communists, members of the <ORGANIZATION> CPSU </ORGANIZATION>, than the already known number of Pravda subscribers?'' <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> said, implying that the real Communist today is one who dutifully reads the paper. Only one week into his new job, the white-haired former <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> adviser already has done something that would have been a surprise coming from his remote predecessor <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, who ran the paper for 13 years. <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> opened Pravda's 8th floor conference room to foreign correspondents and sought their questions. It was a unique opportunity to hear the views of a member of the policy-making party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> now in charge of the most authoritative, if no longer most widely read, Soviet newspaper. As is the custom in such confrontations, <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> occasionally avoided straight answers _ on Pravda's circulation, for example. `` We do n't have definitive information; the circulation was once 10,700,000; it will probably be less,'' he said from the head of a rectangle of wooden tables pushed together to make room for more than 100 journalists, all but a few of them foreigners. Pravda, officially the organ of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, now has tough competition from other dailies that have taken advantage of glasnost to publish more daring or spicier stories. Also, Soviet citizens no longer are required to take Pravda to get another publication they really want, such as a literary monthly or a magazine about movies. A Pravda official told a Westerner who visited the paper last month that only 3 million to 4 million people had subscribed for next year. <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> said research would be used to determine why Pravda's readership has dropped He said there would be `` some innovations'' to tempt readers, among them exclusive publication of some <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> documents. `` After Politburo meetings, we shall publish interviews with the leaders of the party on what they personally think of the subjects raised there,'' he said. It would be a departure if Politburo members were persuaded to give their personal views on its decisions, customarily made in secret and always presented as unanimous. <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> made clear Pravda will not become the pugnacious, Western-style newspaper some Soviets say is needed to safeguard the public interest. `` I must say, the decision about coverage of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or Politburo events is made by the appropriate bodies, and you will agree that it is quite proper and that they ought to have the authority to do it,'' he said, defending the party's right to do business behind closed doors. That was his response when asked why Pravda and other papers had not printed an account of the meeting earlier this month with ranking editors, in which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was said to have accused some of excesses or ideological errors. Western reporters found that many Soviet journalists who attended the technically secret meeting were ready to talk about it. How does <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> see the future of the newspaper founded by <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> in 1912 as a tool to whip up hostility to the czar among workers? `` We shall not become a non-serious, light paper,'' he said. `` We shall not chase hot news, publish non-verified facts or poorly analyzed materials. We shall not seek to increase circulation at all costs.'' Pravda, he said, will try to `` express the very essence of present-day party policies.'' That does not mean <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> shuns making the paper more attractive. `` As far as I am concerned, there can be nothing more attractive than good analysis,'' said the editor, a graduate in philosopy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 Police said they had some leads Monday in the deaths of two elderly women whose blood-drenched bodies were found in homes 500 yards apart, 12 hours after they returned from the same church service. The two women were beaten, stabbed and apparently robbed over the weekend, authorities said. `` We've got leads and we hope to make an arrest or arrests,'' said Cpl. <PERSON> R.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The slayings stunned people in the small community, about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>. `` This has tore everybody all to pieces,'' said <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, who was in <LOCATION> Bald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knob </LOCATION> on Monday visiting her mother. `` Now people are panicking. We've never had anything like this happen.'' The body of <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, 83, was found Sunday morning after a neighbor knocked on her door and got no answer. A short time later, another person spotted an open door next door and notified police, who found the body of <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, 68. Both had last been seen Saturday night at the <LOCATION> Bald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knob </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Methodist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, where they attended a wake for a neighbor. Both victims' homes had been ransacked and were missing small items, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. But he said more valuable items usually taken during a robbery, such as televisions and prescription drugs, had not been touched. `` The motive we're looking at right now is robbery,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't substantiate any other motive at this time.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said an autopsy showed that both victims had been stabbed repeatedly and beaten. `` There is no evidence of gunshot wounds,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` ... There was a considerable amount of blood. The victims apparently lived modestly, and there was no indication of what prompted the attack, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` They did n't appear wealthy,'' he said. `` They were elderly and lived alone. Nothing extravagant. They were neat in their houses. It looked like one lady had done some quilting.'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON>, who lives a half-mile from the two houses, said she had known the victims all her life. `` They were well thought-of in the community,'' she said. `` It's a big shock to all of us My only thought is someone must have thought they had some money. It's so sick.''

 Former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said Monday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must overcome their `` huge and unbridgeable'' differences over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s harsh crackdown on dissent and resume cooperation. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, speaking at a banquet hosted by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, also called for a `` humanely governed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' that wo n't `` turn away from greatness and consign itself to the backwater of oppression and stagnation.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> responded by reiterating the Chinese position that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is responsible for the deterioration in relations and must take the first steps toward reconciliation. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> takes any positive action, the Chinese side will welcome and respond to it,'' the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted the premier as saying. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, on the third day of a private visit, is the most prominent American to come to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the military assault on student-held <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in June. He is expected to brief President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his visit, which includes a scheduled meeting with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> on Tuesday. His message to Chinese officials was clear: conflict over the June killings may never be reconciled, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> must forge ahead with their relations. Addressing <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, who ordered martial law troops into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said differences between `` you, a Chinese Communist who believes in <LOCATION> Leninist </LOCATION> rule -LRB- and -RRB- I, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> conservative who believes in capitalism and democracy, are too great to permit a common understanding.'' But he added: `` Let us not become mired in endless and fruitless recriminations over the seeming impasse that has now developed between our two countries. Both of our nations must now deal realistically with the aftermath.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have indicated they want to resolve one of their deepest rifts since <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s historic 1972 visit ended their long freeze in official contacts. Both, however, have called on the other to act first. When asked about <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s statement that it was time to normalize relations, White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` We have always said that we want to resume good relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at some point. The question really is, when and under what conditions? I would say that at this point we have not reached that time and we have not seen the right conditions.'' Asked if <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was carrying a letter from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I'm not aware of a letter.'' He added that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> talked to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and National Security Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> before he left, `` so maybe he interpreted that conversation as some kind of message.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration responded to the June crackdown by suspending high-level meetings and cutting off arms sales. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says it was justified in putting down a `` counterrevolutionary rebellion'' and has accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trying to undermine its socialist system and interfering in its internal affairs by citing human rights abuses. `` We still have common concerns that make cooperation between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> an indispensable element in ensuring the welfare of our two peoples and serving the cause of peace and prosperity in the world,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said. `` It is neither in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s nor <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s interest for your nation of over 1 billion people to return to its isolation. The certain result would be an angry and impoverished nation.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has a clear choice, he said. `` Shall <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> turn away from greatness and consign itself to the backwater of oppression and stagnation? Or does it continue to venture forth on the open seas on a journey which may at times be rough but which leads to progress and peace and justice for its people?'' The two nations, he said, must `` rise above the acrimony of the moment and resume the progress and cooperation that are worthy of two great peoples.'' At a dinner after <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s arrival Saturday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` old friend'' for his `` foresight and sagacity.'' Qian's speech was generally conciliatory, although he said it is up to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to `` weigh the pros and cons and take a forward-looking apporach so that Chinese-U.S. relations may return to the track of normal development at an early date.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> also met with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruihuan </PERSON>, mayor of the northeastern industrial city of <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> and one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s rising political stars. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, who was appointed to the party's decision-making <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> after the fall of reformist party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> in June, said socialism is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` historical choice.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying it is impossible for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to carry out reforms without adhering to socialism, and it is hard to stick to the socialist system without implementing reforms.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government news media said Monday that 149 of the 355 demonstrators arrested during an anti-government protest will be charged with violating public order. The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said the 149 were detained for 48 hours and all of the others arrested during the demonstration Saturday in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> were released soon after they had been seized. Rude Pravo did not say if the 149 were still in jail and an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said only that they had been held for 48 hours. At a regular news conference Monday, deputy goverment spokesman <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> quickly told reporters he had no official statement on the demonstration and they should address questions to chief government spokesman <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON>, who is on vacation. The party newspaper said the 149 would be charged under anti-demonstration laws passed earlier this year that impose fines of up to $ 2,000. More than 10,000 people gathered Saturday in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to mark the 71st anniversary of Czechoslovak independence. They chanted calls for free elections, a new government and the removal of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>. Rude Pravo said five policemen and seven demonstrators were injured in clashes during the rally but all had been treated and none remained hospitalized. The state media provided no information about 17 foreigners reported detained during the rally, other than repeat the report and say the foreigners were from 11 different countries. Rude Pravo again accused the U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe and <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> radio stations for the anti-government demonstration. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criticized the crackdown on the pro-democracy rally. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said, `` The people of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> know what democracy is and they want it now.'' `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> calls on the government of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to respect the rights of its citizens and to institute the basic freedoms desired by the Czechoslovakian people.'' The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Mlada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fronta </ORGANIZATION>, published for Communist youths, did not take the hard line followed by Rude Pravo. Rude Pravo referred to the people surrounded and attacked by riot police in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> as the `` aggressive'' core of the demonstration. <PERSON> Mlada </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronta </PERSON> said about 300 demonstrators were involved and they were peaceful. It noted the people chanted demands to police not to use violence and shouted, `` We have bare hands!'' raising their arms to show they were unarmed.

 Most Americans favor rapprochement with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in exchange for the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, even though they see the Islamic republic as a sponsor of world terrorism, a national poll has found. Ten years after the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hostage crisis poisoned U.S.-Iran relations, 61 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should offer to resume normal ties if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> got the Americans in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> freed. Support was somewhat lower for releasing Iranian assets locked in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks in trade for the hostages' freedom, with 50 percent in favor. And respondents overwhelmingly rejected paying ransom directly to the captors, with 85 percent opposed. Respondents divided evenly on the idea of direct negotiations with the hostage takers, while most favored indirect negotiations. A majority favored military action, but that fell to a minority if the hostages might be killed in the effort. Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, most by groups believed loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has offered to help free the captives if its assets held in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks were released. It is unclear to what extent <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> controls the captors, if at all. In the poll, though, 72 percent said they believed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> does control the hostage takers, and 79 percent said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> supports international terrorism. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been estranged since Nov. 4, 1979, when Iranian students, apparently with official support, seized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and took 52 Americans hostage. They were held for 444 days, crippling President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s administration and contributing to his defeat in the 1980 election A rescue attempt failed, killing eight servicemen, and the prisoners were freed only on Jan. 20, 1981, the day of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s inauguration. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and now President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have labored with another hostage crisis, the Americans captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, kidnapped in March 1985. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s official position has been that negotiating for the captives' release would encourage more hostage taking. Forty-seven percent in the poll nonetheless favored direct negotiations, while 45 percent opposed the idea. The rest were unsure. A majority, 55 percent, favored indirect negotiations through a third party such as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Respondents at first blush supported military action, with 62 percent favoring the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to try to free the hostages. But if the hostages might be killed in a rescue attempt _ something strategists have been unable to rule out _ just 43 percent supported it. Military action was more popular with men and with people who described themselves as conservatives, while liberals and women were more apt to favor some form of negotiation. Fifty-four percent of the women supported direct talks with the hostage takers, compared with 40 percent of the men. The poll found some dismay at the length of the crisis, with 54 percent saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not done enough to try to free the hostages. Yet there was a split in expectations of whether they ever will be freed: Forty-two percent thought they would, 37 percent thought not, and 21 percent were unsure. The survey was conducted by telephone Sept. 14-24 among a random sample of 1,071 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 The city fire chief is stepping aside while officials look into allegations he had links to arsonists, Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON> announced Monday. Reports about Fire Chief <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> are `` shocking and disturbing,'' <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON> said. `` If there was wrongdoing, it will be prosecuted and penalized,'' the mayor said in announcing <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> would take paid administrative leave. <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON> also said firefighters have been barred from moonlighting for fire adjusting companies, a practice criticized by fire experts quoted in Sunday's report in the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported that properties owned by <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> or his brother, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, have had 11 fires in the past 25 years. It also noted that two associates of <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> were convicted of arson in 1986. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> told the newspaper that he has no connections with any `` fire industry'' in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, and said his department `` is looked on as one of the better fire departments in the country.'' His brother denied any involvement in arson. `` We are confident that after a thorough investigation, we will be totally exonerated from any wrongdoing of any nature,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, an attorney representing <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> requested an examination by outside investigators so he could clear his name. He added that the chief agreed to cooperate fully with the investigators, and volunteered to take the administrative leave. `` I did not have to urge him. He made the offer,'' the mayor said. `` He obviously is in a lot of pain and is very sad today.'' <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Ramsey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has agreed that the investigation into the allegations should be handled by an outside agency, The newspaper report said the fire chief has allowed firefighters to moonlight for an adjusting company that has represented alleged arsonists in fire insurance claims. It also said shoddy investigations by the department have helped arson thrive. The newspaper said its report focused on more than 200 fires in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> over the past 25 years that in some way involved <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> or <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, public adjuster <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, or their friends and associates. The newspaper said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> gave $ 10,000 to set <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> up in business as a public adjuster before becoming chief. It also said that <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>'s most frequent contractor has been <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, and that companies owned by <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> have received millions of dollars in insurance money from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> fires. Asked why many of his cases involved arson fires, <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> said, `` I have no idea.'' He said arsonists who have worked on his staff were not known arsonists at the time. The <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said its reporters examined more than 10,000 pages of documents and interviewed hundreds of people. City police and the state <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apprehension </ORGANIZATION> raised questions about <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> 10 years ago, but their investigation died amid political squabbles, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON> said Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Colonna </PERSON>, 43, who has been with the department for 18 -LCB- years, will serve as acting chief while <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> is on leave. <PERSON> Colonna </PERSON> said he hopes the latest allegations can be cleared up quickly. `` It's easy for anyone to see that these kinds of articles would affect the morale of the Fire Department,'' he said. `` That's why it's so important that this be brought to a public conclusion.'' <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON>, who has served as mayor since 1976, is not seeking re-election in next Tuesday's general election.

<HEAD>Amnesty Reports Unabated Use of Torture in Turkey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that anyone detained in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for suspected political offenses is in danger of being tortured. The worldwide human rights organization said use of torture to obtain information or confessions from political prisoners continued unabated on a wide scale in violation of international treaties signed and ratified by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> last year. London-based <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> said in a new report that more than 500 political prisoners alleged they were tortured in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> so far this year and 10 such prisoners were said to have died in custody as a result of being tortured. Amnesty said most of the allegations relate to initial interrogations in police custody while detainees were routinely denied access to lawyers or relatives. It said that while its report does not discuss torture of criminal prisoners, `` they, too, are frequently reported to have been ill-treated and tortured.'' Amnesty reported `` the government ... has consistently denied that torture is systematic in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and has described those instances of torture which it admits as the isolated actions of individuals.'' The organization welcomed as a step in the right direction draft amendments to the Turkish Criminal Procedure Code announced in September. But it said they fall short of international standards that require all detainees be brought before a judge soon after detention and have prompt access to lawyers, doctors and relatives. The proposals, which still must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Turkish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, would shorten the maximum detention period to four to 10 days and grant lawyers access to detainees. The maximum detention period permitted before a detainee is either formally charged or released now is 24 hours. In political cases it may be extended to 15 days, however, and under emergency legislation up to 30 days. Specific cases cited by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> include 21 students held incommunicado at <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> police headquarters on the day the government announced the draft amendments. The students later said they were tortured while being interrogated. One, 20-year-old <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Yildiz </PERSON>, said that during six days in custody he was stripped naked, hosed down with pressurized cold water, beaten and given electric shocks. The report also cited the death of <PERSON> Seyhmus </PERSON> <PERSON> Orhan </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Yoncali </LOCATION> village in southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. It said he died on July 18 after 24 hours of interrogation at the Command of the 118th Gendarmerie Regiment. Officials said he was shot trying to escape. Other detainees and relatives said he was killed under torture and shot afterward. Amnesty, winner of the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize, said statements extracted under torture are used as evidence against political prisoners. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Maltaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> convicted four people in September of belonging to the illegal organization Devrimci Yol -LRB- Revolutionary Path -RRB- without investigating their allegations that their confessions were extracted under torture. The defendants told the court they were stripped, hosed with ice-cold water, beaten and given electric shocks, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. One said he confessed when police threatened to torture his wife. Amnesty said it repeatedly urged the Turkish government to take effective steps to prevent torture and to meet its obligations under European and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> conventions for the prevention of torture. It said it also asked <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to establish independent and impartial procedures to investigate allegations of torture and to ensure that statements extracted under torture are not used as evidence against defendants.

<HEAD>Energy Prices Raised up to 150 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government imposed steep increases on energy prices, effective Wednesday, in conjunction with a revised budget passed by Parliament that slashes coal subsidies. The price increases and spending cuts were the latest exercise in fiscal toughness from the 2-month-old government led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> of Solidarity in its effort to control the economic crisis. A <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement Monday said electricity would go up 150 percent, natural gas 100 percent and bills for heat and hot water 50 percent. `` Low retail prices of electricity, heat and gas fuels in relation to the cost of production and to other fuels make it necessary to increase retail prices,'' it said. `` This increase is a logical result of the recent increase in the price of coal.'' Similar price increases have brought down <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> governments and led to the birth of Solidarity in 1980s as the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union, but public forbearance toward <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> continues An official announcement Monday said donations to help support his government had reached $ 138,000, most of it from individuals. Foreign governments also have offered tens of millions of dollars' help in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s move toward democracy and a market economy. The first grain shipment donated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> arrived off the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Gdynia </LOCATION> on Monday. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said three <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members would lead a delegation arriving in late November to determine how <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid can be used most effectively. Parliament approved the amended budget Monday by a vote of 301-4, with 35 abstentions. It reduces the projected deficit from 9.2 trillion zlotys -LRB- $ 3.8 billion -RRB- to 4.7 trillion -LRB- $ 1.96 billion -RRB- and trims subsidies for the coal industry by 1.2 trillion zlotys -LRB- $ 500 million -RRB-. It puts expenditures at 34.4 trillion zlotys -LRB- $ 14.3 billion -RRB- in 1989 and income at 29.7 trillion zlotys -LRB- $ 12.4 billion -RRB-. The government hopes partially closing the budget gap will reduce the amount of money in circulation and slow inflation, now at about 600 percent annually. Many food subsidies also have been trimmed, along with government-financed projects and spending on social services. On Oct. 16, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> restricted an indexation plan that provides automatic pay increases to counteract inflation.

<TEXT>
 The leader of a Soviet research station in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> has ordered his personnel to ship their garbage out of the area, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> environmental organization said Monday. A message from the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> vessel <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> at King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> official had at first refused to do anything about the accumulation of waste at the Bellingshausen base on the island, about 600 miles from the southern tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The result of this action is a small but significant step forward for the protection of the Antarctic,'' said <PERSON> Maj </PERSON> <PERSON> DePoorter </PERSON>, the Belgian leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> mission in a message to the organization headquarters in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeburn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said the Soviets reversed their stand after more than 20 <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> members collected rubbish from around the Soviet station and sent a protest to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. He said the protest reported 40 bags of garbage had been collected and returned to the leader of the Soviet station with a demand that the rubbish be removed and disposed of properly. Ms. <PERSON> DePoorter </PERSON>, in her report, said that on Sunday the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> members began to demonstrate as the Soviet resupply ship, <PERSON> Akademik </PERSON> <PERSON> Fyodorov </PERSON>, anchored offshore. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviet vessel has a cargo capacity of more than 5,000 tons and was scheduled to leave the station empty. <PERSON> Leeburn </PERSON> said that after a `` brief confrontation,'' the Soviet official, who was not identified, ordered his personnel to load the garbage aboard the ship for removal from <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> DePoorter </PERSON> said in her message that the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> expedition was told by the Soviet station leader on Friday that none of the rubbish accumulated around the base over many years would be removed. She said, `` The rubbish consisted of food scraps, empty bottles, all sorts of glass receptacles, cans, old radio equipment, doors, windows, beds, drums with rotten food, rusty propellers, engines and piles of plastic ... all scattered over about 200 meters -LRB- yards -RRB- `` and half covered by snow. <PERSON> Leeburn </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> went to King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> to check on the operations of the various stations. Garbage and other debris does not decay in the cold and becomes a threat to the purity of the wilderness and its wildlife, he said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> group reported the <LOCATION> Bellingshausen </LOCATION> station, established in 1968, has a normal complement of about 29 people and twice as many in summer, `` which is now.'' `` The Soviet station has no waste treatment plant, it burns rubbish in open pits and sends nothing back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said eight countries are active on King <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplane accidentally dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided-missile cruiser USS Reeves during maneuvers in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on Monday, slightly injuring five sailors and leaving a five-foot hole in the deck, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The bomb, which detonated upon impact, set off a small fire in the ship's forecastle that was quickly extinguished, said Lt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the Pentagon. The fighter, a single-seat F-A-18 Hornet, had just taken off from the aircraft carrier USS Midway when the incident occurred. `` We do n't know yet why it happened,'' said another spokesman, Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` The pilot has been returned to the Midway and he is being asked that question now.'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the five sailors received minor injuries `` as a result of flying glass and concussion'' from the exploding bomb. The sailors were treated on board their ship, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> does not plan to release their names until their families are told. The carrier and cruiser were conducting `` routine weapons training'' about 32 miles from <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, Cole and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the F-A-18's pilot `` inadvertently'' dropped the bomb, apparently as it passed over the nearby cruiser. The spokesmen said they did not know the altitude of the plane or how far apart the two ships were. Although the bomb left a five-foot hole in the deck near the cruiser's bow, it did no damage to the outer hull, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. Such a ship is `` nuclear capable,'' but as they always do the spokesmen refused to confirm whether nuclear weapons were aboard. Such weapons _ anti-submarine rockets that are being phased out _ would be carried in a forward compartment of the ship. The cruiser was returning to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base at <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garcia </LOCATION> under its own power, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The bomb, a Mark 82 model, is four feet long and 14 inches in diameter. It is a free-fall weapon that can be used against ships or land targets and can be adapted for use as a shrapnel weapon against humans, one <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> source said. The plane is a jet, made by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and first put into service in 1982, which can serve as either a fighter or an attack bomber. The incident occurred at 9:06 p.m. local time, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. Standard time charts give that as the equivalent of 11:06 a.m. EST, but the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> gave the eastern time equivalent as 7:06 a.m. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy. Both the Midway, which is one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s oldest aircraft carriers, and the <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> are based in <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The 533-foot <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> is a Leahy class guided missile cruiser displacing 7,800 tons fully loaded and carrying a complement of 450 officers and enlisted men, It was commissioned in 1964. The 980-foot-long Midway, displacing 64,000 tons at full load, was commissioned in 1945 and has undergone a number of overhauls. It carries a crew of approximately 2,500 officers and enlisted men. The accident was at least the sixth aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship, not counting sailors lost overboard, since the April 19 turret explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa that killed 47 sailors. Only Sunday, a landing accident aboard the training carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lexington </ORGANIZATION> off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> killed a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> student pilot and four members of the deck crew and injured 19 others. The others: _ May 9 Six sailors are killed and five injured in a fire aboard the USS White Plains, a supply ship, in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. _ May 13: Two sailors die in a pump room fire aboard the aircraft carrier USS America in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> _ May 19 A Marine is drowned when a landing craft from the amphibious landing ship USS Duluth overturns during exercises off <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. _ Aug 23. Thirty civilians are injured when a pressure relief valve sprays visitors with hydraulic fluid and water and panic ensues aboard the aircraft carrier USS Kennedy at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration voiced opposition Monday to proposed sanctions on countries that are helping spread ballistic missile technology around the world, saying it can accomplish more through diplomacy. Representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> were unanimous in opposing the proposed sanctions legislation at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing, despite prospects that the number of countries with such technology will double within a decade. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for politico-military affairs, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking to curb the spread of missile technology through the two-year-old Missile Technology Control Regime. The agreement, which now has seven member nations, is likely to grow to include more countries after a meeting set for the first week in December, <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. Mandating sanctions would `` threaten the regime's effectiveness'' because it would inhibit exchanges of information between signatory countries, said <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> `` The sanctions are almost certain to have a chilling effect.'' The sponsor of the legislation, Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., said he was not persuaded by the testimony `` In the end, a regime that has no penalties will not be as successful,'' he said. `` There will be companies and countries that will see the lure of economic benefit as overriding'' proliferation concerns. `` You have to hit them in their economies.'' Conspicuously absent from the Monday's hearing was any detailed discussion of recent revelations that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been aiding <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in developing its own intermediate-range missile. Answering questions from reporters after the hearing, <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> acknowledged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had learned through intelligence channels in January of the <LOCATION> Israel-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> cooperation, and objected to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials at that time. `` We are still having a dipolomatic dialogue'' with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the subject, he said. <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>'s bill would bar companies from doing business with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government or from receiving advanced technology which requires a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export license if they are found to be violating the non-proliferation regime. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> acknowledged that the legislation could have the potential for cutting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which has tremendous political sensitivity, if there were continued transfers. `` If there were a government or corporate relationship with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, that might mandate that we terminate a variety of programs with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolski </PERSON>, an international security official at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is `` seriously considering'' making compliance with export controls a condition of doing business with the government for suppliers involved in the missile technology. A decision in the department's upper echelons is expected soon, he said. The transfer of missile technology has become an increasing concern in the past three years, particularly in light of its potential for providing destabilizing delivery mechanisms for chemical and nuclear weapons. The control regime now includes seven countries: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. It seeks to control export of technology for missiles carrying payloads of more than 1,100 pounds more than 190 miles. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are among other nations that have ballistic missile technology.

 Officials broke ground Monday for the nation's first chemical weapons disposal plant, calling it a step toward worldwide elimination of the lethal agents. Ambassador <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's chief arms negotiator, said the <ORGANIZATION> Tooele </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> facility, dubbed Chemical Disposal System No. 1, represents the `` leading edge of negotiations'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to eliminate their chemical arsenals The ceremony took place on a desolate, sagebrush-strewn plain less than a quarter mile from concrete, dirt-covered igloos housing more than 40 percent of the nation's aging chemical agent stockpile. The $ 212 million CDS1, 48 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, will be the first of eight such <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities slated to dismantle and incinerate old mustard and nerve gas weapons, many of which date to World War II. The Tooele plant is scheduled for completion in 1992. <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> and others said renewed negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> have bolstered hopes for limiting and ultimately destroying chemical weaponry. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, read a statement from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who reiterated his commitment to a joint U.S.-Soviet effort to eliminate both nations' chemical arsenals within the next decade. `` Today, we take another step along that path,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as saying. `` The chemical weapons destruction facility to be built at <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION> says to all the world that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is determined to fulfill its promises, that our people and our government are committed to halting the spread of chemical weapons and eliminating their very existence.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised to reduce stockpiles to 20 percent of existing weapons even before any treaty is signed, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> added. Much of that will be accomplished through destruction of the rockets, canisters, artillery projectiles and other weaponry containing chemical agents. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> mandated destruction of the weapons for safety reasons in 1985. Besides Tooele, other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical stockpiles are at the Pine Bluff Arsenal, Ark.; <ORGANIZATION> Anniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Umatilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activity </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> Proving Ground, Md.; Pueblo Depot Activity, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Lexington-Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, Ky. The eight-building CDS1 complex will be adjacent to igloos where nearly 800 chemical weapons, many of them leaking, are stored. Construction of the facility will employ about 300 people and is expected to begin later this year. From February 1992 until January 1993, the 350 people needed to operate the plant will be trained and simulated tests will be conducted. Destruction of the weapons will begin in February 1993 and take about four years, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 Leftist rebels fired at least 16 shells from homemade mortars at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> Monday but most exploded in nearby streets, killing a gas station attendant and wounding 15 other people. President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinistas of either supplying the weapons or parts and technical skill for their construction to the rebels. The <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, an umbrella organization of guerrilla groups, had announced in February it was suspending the use of homemade mortars in populated areas because their inaccuracy caused civilian casualties. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> told a news conference the attack was `` an attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> to give the impression it is strong. `` But they -LRB- the rebels -RRB- have only the capacity to stage terrorist actions.'' Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> said eight shells struck the grounds of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> adjacent to the ministry compound but no one was wounded there. Authorities said the other shells exploded in adjoining civilian neighborhoods. <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION> reported 30 unfired shells were found on two trucks from which the other shells had been launched. The trucks were in a shopping mall about 300 yards from the military compound. The shells on one truck were covered with garlands of paper flowers, the kind used in ceremonies marking the Day of the Dead holiday on Nov. 2. Those on the other truck were covered with boxes painted as speakers for a musical band. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> called the shelling `` indiscriminate terrorism,'' and also accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government of providing the weapons for the rebels. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> lies when it talks about peace while at the same time waging war,'' <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said, referring to recent efforts to negotiate an end to the decade-old civil war. Representatives of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist government and the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> have met twice since September, but they are far apart on terms for a cease-fire and have only agreed to continue the talks. Two shells exploded at a gasoline station about 800 yards away, killing <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, 72, as he pumped gas. The blasts wounded two attendants. `` I felt I was on a battlefield,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, 27, a mechanic, about 15 minutes after the attack. `` This is very bad,'' said <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, who was shaken by the deafening blasts and the carnage. `` They -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- do n't let the humble people work, and we have to work.'' The gas station was heavily damaged, but there was no fire. Another bomb fell at a nearby fried chicken restaurant, slightly wounding a boy and causing extensive damage. Two mortar shells fell at the entrance to the military compound, and three landed beyond the compound, on a sidewalk bordering a parking lot next to the National Baseball Stadium. At least one soldier and one civilian were wounded by those blasts, witnesses said. Maj. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, chief of the armed forces press committee, said no bombs fell inside the ministry compound. A soldier on duty at the gate said two bombs fell inside the compound, but this could not be confirmed. Witnesses said they saw one injured soldier being evacuated from the compound. The rebels staged a similar attack on Dec. 23, killing three people and wounding 38. Only one of those casualties was a soldier. The rebels issued a communique Feb. 28 announcing they would suspend such attacks because of `` faults and deficiencies'' that were causing `` high risk to the civilian population, without us at any time having intended to harm innocent civilians.'' According to human rights organizations, most of the more than 70,000 people killed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s civil war have been civilians.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an unusually frank comment Monday, `` CBS This Morning'' co-anchor <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said `` my days are numbered'' at the program if its ratings, now third among network morning shows, do n't improve. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> spoke while on the syndicated `` Donahue'' show with her two female competitors on network morning programs, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunden </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, who is leaving `` Today'' at the end of this year. `` I ca n't lie about that _ I know the ax is right there,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said when asked by host <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> if she was feeling the pressure of being on a program that is third in the ratings. The CBS News program, which <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> co-anchors with <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, premiered on Nov. 30, 1987. It succeeded a short-lived, low-rated entertainment show, and was the latest in CBS' long effort to compete in the morning. Although <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said her program's ratings have risen 50 per cent since it began, she also said that if more viewers do n't watch `` and we do n't improve from where we are -LRB- in ratings -RRB-, my days are numbered. `` And I do n't think there's a question about that. That's the business. I know that. I'm a grownup.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who joined <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, did n't elaborate. There was no immediate comment from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. During Monday's show <LOCATION> Pauley </LOCATION> _ who last Friday told her national `` Today'' audience that she is leaving after 13 years and will be succeeded by news anchor <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> _ reiterated that it was her decision to leave. However, she said in response to a viewer's question, she would n't be leaving as soon as she is had not <PERSON> Norville </PERSON>, whom she has called a friend, been hired for the program. <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> became its news anchor on Sept. 5 `` No, I would not be leaving at this time because the shift in attitude would have come along much more slowly,'' she said, referring to her own attitude about leaving the top-rated program. `` It took some kind of an external jolt, if you will, to propel me out of a course I had very happily traveled for 13 years,'' she said. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, whose current <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> contract has been extended to 1992, will co-anchor a prime time news series that will premiere in late June or early July. She also will anchor a prime-time special called `` Changes'' in March.

<TEXT>
 Rebel rocketing closed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s international airport Monday for the second time in three days The government acknowledged that U.S.-backed guerrillas surround <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, a strategic town near the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. Other rocket attacks around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> wounded five people, the government said. A government source and two witnesses said rebels captured <PERSON> Sore </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalli </PERSON>, the hometown of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s first Marxist ruler, <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON>. The guerrillas also maintained their 10-day blockade of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s four major highways, causing food and fuel prices to rise Military officers of the Soviet-backed government fear the fractious rebel front has begun to unite, a government source said, quoting military officials. Lack of unity hurt the rebels in their attempt to oust the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government after Soviet forces withdrew from their decade-long military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviet withdrawal was completed last February. The source, speaking with the condition he not be identified, said Moslem rebels loyal to moderate <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> and others led by fundamentalist <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> were coordinating the 10-day blockade of <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, the northern route out of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Diplomats quoted government officials as saying <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON>'s men and the government were negotiating. <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> was said to be offering to open the road in exchange for food. Several united guerrillas forces reportedly were fighting government troops around <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, 25 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. Government spokesman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said rebels were shelling <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from all sides. Government sources and diplomats have reported that a Khost-bound convoy carrying weapons and food turned back toward <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> after fierce fighting outside of <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION>, which lies between <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> has relied on air shipments since January 1988. Soldiers at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s airport reported it was closed after being hit by at least 12 rockets. They said air shipments from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had dwindled to about 10 a day from about 30. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the prices for flour, mutton and rice continued to go up and sugar could not be found. More than 2,000 trucks carrying suppies for <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> were said to be blocked on the highway. Private truckers entering <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from other roads said those routes, too, were closed to government traffic. Government officials have estimated that <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s food and fuel stocks would last about a month if land and air routes were cut. Silos holding 50,000 tons of flour were said to be full and the government has also stockpiled gasoline. But most of the flour would go to government employees and their families, comprising about 800,000 of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s estimated 2.2 million people. A goverment source said rebels seized <PERSON> Sore </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalli </PERSON>, the hometown of <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Last week thousands of rebels attacked the city in <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> province south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. A government source and two truck drivers who said they witnessed the battle reported that by Friday the guerrillas had routed the 3,000-strong garrison. The truck drivers reported 10 rebels killed and 80 wounded. They had no information on government casualties. <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON> set up the garrison after he seized power in a coup in April 1978. Althoug he was ousted and killed in another coup in September 1979, the garrison remained one of the most powerful in the province, the government source said.

<HEAD>Ninth Nuclear Test of Year Set For Tuesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nuclear weapon is scheduled to be detonated Tuesday morning deep beneath the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site in a major test that may be felt as far away <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. If weather conditions are favorable, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to set off the weapon at 7 a.m. PST. Scientists had planned to conduct the test Saturday, but it was postponed because of winds blowing toward populated areas. The blast is to range from 20 to 150 kilotons, and may be felt up to 105 miles away, according to <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> is 105 miles southeast of the test site. Managers of high-rise buildings in the city were warned not to have workers in precarious positions at the time of the detonation. The test will be the ninth of the year at the nation's nuclear proving grounds, and the 696th announced blast since nuclear testing began at the site in January 1951. The test is a weapons-related detonation to be conducted at the bottom of a shaft 1,850 feet beneath the surface of <LOCATION> Pahute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. Scientists from <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> are conducting the test. It is the first test since Sept. 14, when a smaller nuclear weapon was detonated at the site. The DOE does not specify the expected yield of each detonation, classifying them as either under 20 kilotons or between 20 and 150 kilotons. Only tests in the upper limits that are expected to produce ground motion away from the site are announced in advance.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, who defied the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by going to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said Monday he showed people there <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> cares and gave a prominent <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> leader some down-home political advice. <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, who are of Lebanese descent, returned Sunday from unsanctioned meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, whose forces control east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers described the two meetings as friendly and respectful. Conversations with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who's pivotal in determining whether <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> ratifies a new peace plan, also were frank, <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We advised him that he ought to cool his anti-American rhetoric,'' said <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, who predicted <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> would become `` I think more toned-down.'' <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, who's been in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for 13 years, said he also passed along to the military leader this political advice: `` Bite your tongue and just hope that the follies of your enemies will catch up with them.'' In response, `` He said, ` I hear you,''' <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> recounted. The two Democrats' private diplomatic mission was not approved by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which blocked an August attempt by <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> to go to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> defended the trip, saying the legislators did not engage in amateur diplomacy or hostage negotiation. `` We were n't there as administration spokesmen,'' he said. `` There's never any good time, according to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, to visit that country.'' <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> said he and Oakar accomplished their primary goal. `` I think we showed that despite the withdrawal of our ambassador the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is still committed to achieving peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` That had, I think a very positive impact on the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people.''

 Police arrested 169 youths on the first night of a special curfew for a three-day campaign against <ORGANIZATION> Devil </ORGANIZATION>'s Night arson, a police spokesman said Monday. About 30,000 volunteers have pledged to help police patrol city streets and ease the burden on firefighters, who in 1984 battled 808 fires during the three-day period before and including Halloween. The number of fires has declined steadily every year since 1984. Last year, there were 229 fires. Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> A. Young's office refused to release the number of arson fires until Wednesday, spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> would n't say if any fires were set since Sunday night. But he did say no arson-related arrests or fire-related injuries were reported overnight. The special dusk-to-dawn curfew took effect at 6 p.m. Sunday and ends at 6 a.m. Wednesday. The curfew allows police to arrest youths 17 and under who are not accompanied by an adult while outdoors. The 17-year-olds faced hearings Monday on the misdemeanor charge, while those 16 and under were released either to the custody of a parent or guardian or were held in the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Youth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION>, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>. Police arrested 302 curfew violators on the first night of the 1988 Devil's Night period, which was a Saturday. Buck said the number declined this year because outdoor activity generally is slower on a Sunday.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> expressed concern Monday that Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> may try to use alleged attacks by the Nicaraguan Contras as an excuse to scuttle elections set for next February. `` I worry that they -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- may be trying to lay a predicate to walk away from their commitment to hold elections,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Monday said that the elections would be held as planned, regardless of the resolution of the dispute over the Contras. `` The elections are taking place in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, period,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said, speaking through an interpreter in an interview with NBC News. `` With Contra or without Contra they are going to take place, definitely. With war or no war, that is, elections are taking place.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has said that, under certain conditions, he may not renew a cease-fire that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contras agreed to in March 1988. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has contended that the rebels have systematically violated the agreement. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> may be worried that opposition candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> could have a `` real chance of winning if the elections are halfway free and fair.'' `` If there is a chance for democracy to win an election, maybe the approach has n't been all wrong,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, answering skeptics who contend the administration has not applied enough pressure on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The administration was `` waiting and watching'' to see if <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> will call off a 19-month truce with U.S.-backed rebels. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> was a target of mounting pressure from his Latin American neighbors not to follow through on his threat. `` The issue pretty much goes back to President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in the sense of he's changed his position a little bit,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We, obviously, are urging that the cease-fire be maintained.'' After startling a hemispheric conference on democracy in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> by announcing Friday that he would cancel the cease-fire, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> modified his position to say he would decide the matter Tuesday. A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, agreed with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> that a decision by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to abrogate the cease-fire would be merely `` a pretext to end the election process.'' Recent polls show <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to be trailing the U.S.-backed presidential candidate, <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, in campaigning for next February's elections. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., called <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s threat `` regrettable I hope it will be reconsidered.'' `` By all reports, both <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> are suffering ... -LRB- because of -RRB- a blunder on his part,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at least four Latin American presidents had chastised <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and that Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who won a Nobel Prize for his efforts to bring peace to the region, was `` furious.'' Chatting with several reporters he invited for a mid-day jog, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had been misunderstood in calling <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> a little man, and that he had meant to say small-minded. He conceded that the Nicaraguan leader, who is five-foot-ten, is not small of stature. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would not speculate on whether he might seek renewed military aid for the Contras if <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> carries through on his threat. His spokesman, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said: `` Our purpose is still to get a free and fair election and to pursue the peace process.'' Administration officials privately said a request for military aid was extremely unlikely _ given strong bipartisan congressional opposition to rearming the Contras. Under an agreement reached last spring between the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, humanitarian aid is to be continued to the Contras through the Feb. 25 elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Congressional leaders have vowed to adhere to that agreement _ which also envisions the disbanding of the rebel group once free and fair elections have been assured. `` We have an agreement with the administration,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said on Monday. With <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to announce on Tuesday whether he will continue the cease-fire, `` it's pretty much a case of waiting and watching to see what he does and to make sure that our views are clear,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials `` do not buy for one minute'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s rationale for threatening to end the truce _ violations of the cease-fire by the Contras. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that Sandinista violations, including breaking a treaty banning shipping arms to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, `` dwarf any violations by the Contras.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said that `` Latin leaders were shocked and disappointed'' by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s behavior at the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. `` I would note that this -LRB- Contras -RRB- is an army without ammunition, by and large. They have not received any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military supplies since February 1988, while the Sandinista is a well-equipped, well-supplied military force,'' the official said. `` So, the idea that the resistance would routinely attack the Sandinista army is an unlikely event.

 A 23-year-old Palestinian was sentenced Monday to 16 life terms in prison for killing 16 people, including an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and two Canadians, when he forced a crowded passenger bus off the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv-Jerusalem </LOCATION> highway. The attack July 6 was the bloodiest in the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and the sentence imposed on <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> was one of the stiffest in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s history. Also Monday, newspapers said the army will soon begin using observation balloons equipped with cameras to keep track of protests and disturbances related to the uprising. A Canadian TV correspondent was slightly wounded and a 14-year-old Palestinian boy was critically injured when soldiers opened fire on stone throwers in a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp. Also in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, soldiers searched the office of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalist <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharita </PERSON>, said to do work for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency, and removed documents they deemed suspicious, military officials said. They said the documents would be returned if found to be non-inflammatory. A Palestinian refugee died Monday of a gunshot wound suffered five days earlier in the Farah refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army said. He was identified as <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassani </PERSON>, 24, and the army said he was about to throw a cement block at soldiers when shot. Thirteen Palestinians were wounded in clashes with soldiers in the occupied lands on Monday, including the boy shot in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and two Arabs shot in the <PERSON> Farah </PERSON> camp in protests that broke out after <PERSON> Hassani </PERSON>'s death was reported, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials said. <PERSON> Hassani </PERSON>'s death raised to 607 the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis in the Palestinian revolt, which began in December 1987. An additional 137 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most as suspected collaborators with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Forty Israelis have died. <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison for each of the deaths in the bus attack. He also received 20 years for each of the 24 passengers wounded in the attack. The sentences are to be served concurrently. Chief Prosecutor <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasson </PERSON> said there was no parole for murder sentences and <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> could be freed only if the president intervened on his behalf. The victims included the only American to be killed in the uprising, lawyer <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Two victims were Canadian tourists, <PERSON> Fern </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykiss </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Winnepeg </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpenny </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON>, who was injured in the incident, said he carried out the attack to avenge a friend wounded by soldiers and paralyzed in a clash near his home in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Nusseirat refugee camp. The attack prompted several days of revenge attacks by Jews on Arabs in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and other cities. The Canadian correspondent wounded in <LOCATION> Shabura </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> was identified as <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON> of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He was hit with a rubber bullet in the leg, colleagues and the army command said. An army spokesman said an officer fired at the legs of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> rioters, hitting <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON>. `` The journalist was standing among the rioters ... and was not identified by the officer before the shooting was carried out. He was bandaged by troops and taken to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> clinic,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON> received stitches at a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> clinic and was taken to a local hospital for X-rays `` as a precaution,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> CBC </ORGANIZATION> producer who asked that his name not be used. <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON> was at least the third journalist wounded since the uprising began. In the same incident, a Palestinian boy was hit in the head with a plastic bullet fired by the troops, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> <PERSON> Kishda </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> Soroka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the reports said.

<TEXT>
 Disputing the existence of serious differences among key officials, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Monday the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is trying to seize `` what we think is an opportunity'' for significant reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said `` there are only nuances of differences'' over whether Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can succeed in his program of transforming the country politically and economically. Calling that a question of `` durability,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said `` I do n't think there is any policy difference in the administration on the question of the desirability'' of the Soviet leader's perestroika policy <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s comments were designed to put to rest the notion that differences among top officials were slowing a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s bold approaches, particularly in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Just last week, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> acted to quash a speech by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, the deputy national security adviser, that took a pessimistic view of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s chances after <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in two speeches had set forth the administration's position welcoming the changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has voiced reservations similar to those in Gates' speech. On the other hand, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> has accused the administration of being timid in response to Soviet initiatives. `` We've made up our mind,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` that there is an opportunity there we should try and seize; that it would be a mistake -LRB- not to try -RRB- regardless of what we think about his -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s -RRB- chances of success. And quite clearly he faces some very major problems.'' But, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` we ought to talk about that in the right way and at the right time.'' On another subject, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he did not expect `` definitive answers'' on prospects for <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> negotiations during an eight-day trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> beginning Tuesday night. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will meet with Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> and attend a 12-nation planning session for a new economic grouping among Asian nations. `` We may continue to talk even while I am on the trip,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` But I would guide you off looking for either a make-or-break on this thing before the trip is over.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has been conducting much of his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> diplomacy by telephone with Foreign Ministers <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. His goal is to set up a meeting between Israelis and Palestinians leading to elections on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. `` I have not put any deadline on this and we will continue to try and work -LRB- on -RRB- the problem,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Turning to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> during a 20-minute session in his seventh floor office in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reaffirmed his view that President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> may be using reported attacks by Contra insurgents as an excuse to try to scuttle elections set for next February. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has said that, under certain conditions, he may not renew a cease-fire that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contras agreed to in March 1988. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has contended that the rebels have systematically violated the agreement. `` I worry that they -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- may be trying to lay a predicate to walk away -LRB- justify a walking away -RRB- from their commitment to hold elections,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> for his part insisted in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television that he was not walking away from the elections. `` The elections are taking place in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, period,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> may be worried that opposition candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> could have a `` real chance of winning if the elections are halfway free and fair,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` If there is a chance for democracy to win an election, maybe the approach has n't been all wrong,'' he concluded.

 A homeless man with a history of mental problems was convicted Monday of raping and murdering a pregnant doctor in her hospital office. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 23, had admitted killing Dr. <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinnant </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> last Jan. 7. But his lawyer said he was insane and therefore not responsible for the crimes. The jury, however, accepted a prosecutor's assertion that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was aware of his actions and that his insanity defense was a ruse to escape punishment. The jury deliberated for only two hours. The <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> jury convicted <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of all counts he faced: murder, rape, robbery and sodomy. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who faces a maximum of 50 years to life in prison, showed no emotion. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Leff </PERSON> set sentencing for Nov. 21. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is the name of the regular trial court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The defendant's mother, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said, `` He did n't have a ghost of a chance with the ghosts in that courtroom.'' <PERSON> Hinnant </PERSON>, 33, was five months pregnant when she was attacked in her fourth-floor office-laboratory at the massive 1,200-bed hospital. Her husband, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, and a hospital administrator found her body the next day. According to trial testimony, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told police he sometimes slept in a storeroom on the hospital's 22nd floor and walked around unnoticed in surgical garb and carrying a stethoscope. He claimed he watched operations, slept in the doctor's quarters and visited patients' roomms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Marvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornberg </PERSON>, argued that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> deliberately left clues at the scene so police could find and hospitalize him. As proof of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s insanity, <PERSON> Kornberg </PERSON> cited medical records dating back to when his client was 14. Almost all of them say <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has low intelligence and is delusional, that he hallucinates and hears voices. A psychiatrist who testified for the defense said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> appeared to have a psychosis related to schizophrenia. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> initially told police he had an accomplice named `` <PERSON> John </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Kornberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> John </PERSON> was a delusion, that the defendant really thought this person had punched and raped <PERSON> Hinnant </PERSON> and then helped him kill her. `` The man is mentally sick,'' <PERSON> Kornberg </PERSON> told jurors. `` The man is not criminally responsible for what he does.'' But Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kindler </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is sane. `` He was aware of what murder was, and he was aware that <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinnant </PERSON> was murdered,'' <PERSON> Kindler </PERSON> said. `` So why is insanity a defense?'' <PERSON> Kindler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> invented stories about hearing voices, compulsive behavior and `` John'' because he was trying to escape responsibility for what he did. As for fingerprints and other clues at the scene, <PERSON> Kindler </PERSON> said, they show <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was sloppy, careless and unlucky, but they do n't show that he was crazy.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, her government rocked by the resignation of her top treasury official, sank Monday to the worst ratings of her decade in power. One sounding showed her the most unpopular leader since polling began here. `` She can not afford many more mishaps,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON>, former chairman of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who helped mastermind Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s third successive election victory in 1987. In a National Opinion Poll sounding, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> hit the lowest popularity rating for any prime minister since polling started in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> 50 years ago. Only 24 percent of a sample of 935 voters questioned said they were satisfied with her performance and 61 percent blamed her for Thursday's sudden resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. He said he could not continue in the 22-member Cabinet so long as Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> retained a personal economic adviser, Sir <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, who opposes <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> joining fully the European Monetary System which links key <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> then also resigned. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is lukewarm toward membership of the system's currency-stabilizing exchange rate mechanism, while both <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> and the deputy prime minister Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> favor it She fired <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> as foreign secretary last June. <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON>, one of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s closest political associates, described the latest forced Cabinet shuffle as `` an appalling political muddle.' `` She should remember it is dangerous for a captain to appear semi-detached from the team,'' <PERSON> Tebitt </PERSON> wrote in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Evening Standard. The furor has heightened criticisms of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s style as bossy, hectoring and intolerant of opposing views in the Cabinet. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s new foreign secretary, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, said Monday that some <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers `` shrivel up'' before Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` She likes an argument,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said in a television interview. `` Some people find it difficult to argue with a woman prime minister, so they rather tend to shrivel up and feel resentful. `` The answer is actually to argue back,'' the former Home Secretary said. `` You'll find yourself being contradicted and sometimes told you do n't know what you are talking about. But if you persevere ... you gain ground.'' The National Opinion Poll, published in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, The Independent, was taken by telephone in the three days after <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> quit and the British media reported the government in crisis. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> already held the unpopularity record when she scored a 25 percent satisfied rating in Gallup and Market Opinion and Research International polls in 1981 when the effects of her tight-money policies sent unemployment soaring. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> held the previous unpopularity record of 27 percent satisfied in a 1968 Gallup sounding. The National Opinion Poll, which gave no margin of error, showed 62 percent of those questioned said they were dissatisfied with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Fourteen percent had no opinion. A Harris Poll, for the BBC-TV current affairs program, `` Panorama'' being screened Monday night, showed the Conservatives 13 points behind the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Fifty-two percent of those questioned said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> should resign now. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, meanwhile, called senior leaders of her troubled party to discuss strategy at her No. 10 Downing St. residence. Party chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> acknowledged afterward, `` The government has appeared from time to time to be disunited.'' The Harris poll, taken over the weekend among 925 voters, gave <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> 50 percent of the vote, enough for a landslide election victory, and the Conservatives 37 percent. The rest split among two small centrist parties and the Greens. In an ominous sign for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> who had been credited relatively widely with pulling the British economy around, 61 percent said the government was handling the economy badly. Sixty-seven percent said they had little or no confidence in her handling of the government. Since the furor over <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s resignation, the Conservatives have slumped to an average 10 points behind <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> in polls, compared with around 7 points behind during the previous month. The Conservatives have trailed Labor consistently since early summer.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot making his first landing attempt on an aircraft carrier was `` low and slow'' before his training jet crashed on the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, killing him and four others, the ship's captain said Monday. The T-2 <LOCATION> Buckeye </LOCATION> slammed into the ship's island, the tower-like part of the ship which also was hit by a kamikaze plane in World War II, before cartwheeling across the deck and exploding in flames Sunday afternoon, said Capt. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flack </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>. `` It looked like a battle zone. There were pieces of aircraft and of metal all over the place. Bodies were spread throughout different areas,'' Lt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a physician and the ship's medical officer, said after the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> returned to its dock late Monday morning In addition to the five dead, 19 people were injured, <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. The pilot, <PERSON> Ensign </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pontell </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was the only one aboard the two-seat trainer, a normal situation when aviators make their first carrier landings, <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pontell </PERSON>, a 1988 graduate of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Academy in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was a member of <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> 19 at <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> identified the other dead as Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Holly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, Miss.; Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Timmy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garroutte </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; and Airman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, all <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> crew members; and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gervis </PERSON> <PERSON> Courvelle </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, a civilian employee of <ORGANIZATION> DynCorp </ORGANIZATION> which has a contract to maintain <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aircraft. The four were on the flight deck, officials said. In another accident involving a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessel, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplane accidentally dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided-missile crusier USS Reeves during maneuvers Monday in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The bomb left a 5-foot hole in the ship's main deck and five sailors were slightly injured, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> was steaming in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in clear weather about 30 miles south of its home port here when the jet crashed. `` As I see it,'' <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said, `` he ended up in a position which in naval aviation is known as being low and slow, which is a very terrible place to be when you are coming aboard a ship.'' Landing signal officers radioed the pilot to add power and waved him off, but he did not comply, <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. He said an investigation would try to explain why. `` The nose pitched up, and he lost control of his ability to fly the aircraft, and it went up and came into the island,'' the captain said. The plane flipped upside down before a wing tip hit the island just below the control tower, the captain said. The wing tip broke off and remained embedded in the superstructure when the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> docked Monday. The jet's fuselage then smashed into the side of the island, but the ship showed little evidence of the accident other than the wreckage of the plane, still upside down, covered with orange and white parachutes. It hit at the feet of Airman <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Votolato </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Houma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, who was inside a glassed-in area operating a video camera used to tape all landings. The <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s oldest carrier, its only one used exclusively for training and the only one with women aboard. The impact knocked <PERSON> Votolato </PERSON> to the floor, but she got back up and pointed her camera at the flight deck in time to capture the plane bursting into flames. Airman <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> was directing crew members on the deck where to park planes as they landed. `` He was headed straight for us,'' <PERSON> Gurley </PERSON> said. `` I turned and there was just a great boom. It shook me and I buckled down, but I knew I had to get out the door because the flames were coming right for my station. I knew I would be wiped out so I took off running.'' <PERSON> Gurley </PERSON>, his arm in a sling, said a piece of metal had hit him in the back. He made it inside the island only to discover his shirt was on fire. He took it off, put out the flames, put it back on and joined firefighting efforts. Pieces of the plane struck three other parked jets, but <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said it appeared all three can be repaired. Pilots in the other three planes jettisoned their canopies and clambered out, <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. Airplanes normally land on the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>'s 910-foot, blacktop flight deck at about 110 to 120 knots, or up to 138 mph, said Cmdr. <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON>, the ship's air officer. They stop by catching their tailhooks on cables stretched across the 192-foot-wide deck. Aircraft land on the stern of the ship. The crash occurred six days before the 45th anniversary of the kamikaze attack that killed 47 crew members and injured 127 on Nov. 4, 1944.

 Entertainer <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> should get $ 400,000 from an advertising agency that imitated the Grammy-winning singer's voice in a TV commercial, a federal jury ruled Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury, which began deliberating Friday, decided that <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> violated Miss <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>'s rights by imitating her voice. In a statement given reporters, the agency called the award `` unfortunate but bearable.'' `` I hope my victory will in a small way contribute to higher ethical standards in the advertising field,'' Miss <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> said in a statement. `` I also hope it will cause companies to pause before they knowingly and willfully trod on the property rights of others.'' The actress and singer said she was considering appealing a court ruling that barred the jury from awarding punitive damages because <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> had a good-faith belief it was acting within the law. At the trial, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> testified, `` I do n't do commercials,'' and said one of her former backup singers was hired to perform the song `` Do You Wan na Dance?'' for a 1986 Mercury Sable car commercial after she turned down a request from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Miss <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>, who has appeared in such films as `` Beaches'' and `` Outrageous Fortune,'' filed the lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 seeking $ 2.5 million in damages Miss <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> also filed a $ 10 million lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON> ruled Thursday there was insufficient evidence to proceed against the car company. Miss <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>, said he hoped `` national advertisers and advertising agencies will think twice in the future before they disregard the rights of artists.'' <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> told the jury his client never agreed to sing in the commercial, and she never would have. The agency `` took what they could n't buy from <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>,'' he said. `` She had the right to say no. That right was taken away from her,'' <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> said. Defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Callagy </PERSON> claimed <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> never intended to imitate Miss <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>'s voice, but instead `` tried to do credible renditions of the original recording of her 1971 hit song. He said the agency bought a license to use the song. `` The mere imitations of a performance is not a violation of copyright law. We imitated the record; we did not imitate the voice,'' said <PERSON> Callagy </PERSON>. Two years ago, a judge threw out <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>'s case, ruling the agency acted like `` the average thief'' but had broken no laws. An appeals court overturned that decision. Prior to the start of deliberations, <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON> instructed jurors, `` When a professional singer's voice is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product, the singer's rights have been violated.

<HEAD>Pedro Vargas, Tenor of the Americas, Dead at 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mexican singer <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, nicknamed `` the tenor of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>,'' died early Monday of heart failure, his family said. He was 85. `` He died in his sleep,'' his oldest son, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, told reporters. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> had been suffering for several years from diabetes and heart problems. Known for his rich melodious voice, <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>' singing career spanned more than 60 years and included performances at Carnegie Hall, Madison Square Garden and the White House. He sang for Presidents <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, shared the stage with <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and counted <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> among his friends and admirers. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> was considered one of the brightest starts in the `` Golden Age'' of Mexican music, which spanned the 1930s and'40s. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, in partnership with composer Mexican <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, popularized the `` bolero'' and the `` paso doble,'' the fast-paced Spanish double footstep dance. He also appeared in dozens of films, most of them produced in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. It was considered one of the greatest musical partnerships in the Spanish-speaking world. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allende </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, on April 29, 1904, the second of 13 children. He was a quiet and introverted child whose family wanted him to become a priest. Instead, he developed an early vocation for music and began singing in a chorus in high school in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1917. After high school, he tried to become a bullfighter but failed, and turned to studying medicine. But singing remained his first love and his strong tenor voice gained him quick admission to the National Conservatory of Music. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> got his first break in 1928 when he was selected to sing the role of Turidu in the Italian opera Cavalleria Rusticana by <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Mascagani </PERSON>. The performance was so successful that it led to a tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> then turned to popular ballads, eventually reaching an audience of millions in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. His rendition of `` Fleur-de-Lis'' was his hallmark throughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the 1930s. `` He was a personal friend of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and, although they never sang together, he did sing with a mutual friend, <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>,'' his son recalled Monday. `` This morning, I received with great emotion condolences from my father's death from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> and <PERSON> Libertad </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamarque </PERSON>, among others,'' <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> is survived by his wife <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, four children and seven grandchildren.

<HEAD>Security Council Finds Consensus on Namibia Resolution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> ambassadors agreed Monday on a mild resolution that criticizes <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s administration in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> but does not claim that free and fair elections are impossible in the territory. Unanimous adoption was likely Tuesday after the 15 ambassadors consult their capitals, said Western and Third World diplomats on the council, speaking on condition of anonymity. Black African and non-aligned nations began circulating draft resolutions two weeks ago that castigated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for alleged abuses, and prepared to follow up with strong speeches before the Nov. 7-11 Namibian election. British diplomats said those resolutions invited vetoes from more than one of the five permanent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Western diplomats said Third World nations were trying to mount an 11th-hour campaign to boost the electoral chances of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. Intense consultations resulted in language agreeable to all council members. `` This is a watered-down version that causes us no problems,'' said <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which is not on the council. `` There's nothing in there that they can use to declare the elections null and void.'' The final draft `` welcomes'' Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s report on <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which outlined areas of concern but concluded that the territory is headed for a free and fair election. It `` demands immediate, full and strict compliance by all parties concerned, in particular <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' in implementing council resolutions calling for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence. It demands that all paramilitary and ethnic forces and commando units be disbanded, particularly the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>, a dreaded counterinsurgency unit. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has accused its main competitor, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, of hiring <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> veterans to intimidate pro-SWAPO voters and break up campaign rallies. The resolution calls for decommissioning the 1,500 South African <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> soldiers still in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, now confined to base under U., N. supervision. It demands repeal of `` such remaining restrictive and discriminatory laws and regulations as inhibit the holding of free and fair elections,'' without specifying any. The resolution endorses <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s opinion that law AG8, which establishes a racially segregated society in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, should be repealed. Namibians will vote for a constituent assembly to draft a constitution and organize the first independent, black majority-ruled government in the territory of 1.3 million. If <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> wins two-thirds of the votes, it will be able to unilaterally write the constitution and organize any form of government it chooses. The former German colony has been governed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since 1915. Last December, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> signed accords with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreeing to cooperate with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence as <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> withdraws its 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

 Three railway lines in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> were closed Monday night by bomb warnings, one day after Protestants and Roman Catholics traveled together to defy <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> disruption of cross-border trains. Anonymous telephoned warnings of bombs on the lines closed the cross-border service between <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION> in the north and <LOCATION> Dundalk </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Separate warnings shut down services in the north between <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Larne </LOCATION>. Police said they would not inspect the tracks until daylight because they fered possible ambushes and booby traps. The closures meant disruption Tuesday morning for thousands of Belfast-bound commuters. Hundreds of people traveled on `` peace trains'' last weekend to protest bombings and bomb threats by the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has halted the cross-border route more than 60 times this year in its fight to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Seven explosions ripped through an oil-field service company Monday, injuring two workers, damaging 25 mobile homes and forcing the evacuation of about 200 people, authorities said. `` It was just like mortar rounds shot out in all directions,'' Police Chief Dean <PERSON> Akings </PERSON> said in this city of about 17,000 people 112 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>. The explosions and fire at <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on the eastern edge of the city began at 7:50 a.m., and were caused by shaped charges, which are explosives used in the oil industry, officials said. A search for live charges and blasting caps was under way Monday night. `` There was over 1,000 of those projectiles inside the business,'' <PERSON> Akings </PERSON> said. `` They all went somewhere. We've had some of those projectiles located up to three-quarters of a mile away.'' The city police and fire departments, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> and an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bomb squad from <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> took part in the search. Residents were warned to call authorities if they spotted any charges, which can be set off by high heat or pressure. The first explosion was followed by six more blasts and a fire at the company. Firefighters standing outside the building put the blaze out within about 20 minutes, said Fire Chief <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisinger </PERSON>. `` I was n't going to send people in,'' <PERSON> Meisinger </PERSON> said, citing the danger of another explosion. About 200 residents within a quarter-mile of <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> were evacuated, <PERSON> Akings </PERSON> said. Everyone except the residents of the 25 mobile homes damaged by the explosions had returned to their homes by late Monday. The two workers injured were inside the building when the explosions erupted. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, 27, suffered cuts and was in stable condition at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Nursing Supervisor <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 35, was treated and released. At least four or five vehicles parked in front of a machine shop across the street from Wire Tech were heavily damaged, said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindholm </PERSON>, who works at the shop. Wire Tech provides service to established oil wells, and does not manufacture explosives. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Juergensen </PERSON>, who lives near the plant, said she was leaving her house when the first blast occurred. `` I was heading out the door when it hit. We waited for everything to quit flying around,'' she said. `` ... It shook everything and everybody.''

<HEAD>Hungarian TV Broadcasts Czech Dissident Havel's Critical Comments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State TV showed extensive film on Monday of police beating demonstrators with clubs in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and broadcast an interview with top dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> raking <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s hard-line communist leadership. `` Society is slowly waking'' in protest against repression, banned playwright <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> told the Panorama public affairs show. His comments were part of a 20-minute segment dealing with demonstrations on the 71st anniversary of Czechoslovak independence. More than 10,000 people defied a police ban and rallied for democracy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> last Saturday, despite hundreds of arrests and beatings by riot police. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was interviewed in a hospital on Friday. He has been there for treatment of a bronchial inflammation since shortly after his arrest Thursday, two days before mass protests broke out. Alluding to promises of change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, forced by mass demonstrations, and to reforms in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said, `` The -LRB- Czechoslovak -RRB- authorities are very nervous and are acting accordingly.'' `` The present Czechoslovak leadership is increasingly isolated at home as well as abroad.'' Formal alliance in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has been unable to paper over increasing tensions between <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, one of the most orthodox Soviet bloc countries, and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which is rapidly evolving into a multiparty democracy. Political differences were heightened by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s decision to unilaterally declare a moratorium on its part of a <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> dam and canal project with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. It says completion of the project would cause irreversible ecological havoc. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> plans to finish construction of its part and demands compensation from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> if it pulls out permanently. In a separate Panorama interview, movie director <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Menzel </PERSON>, best-known abroad for his Oscar-winning film `` Closely Watched Trains,'' described <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> as split between `` those who rule ... and those who obediently ... accept everything that happens.'' Panorama also showed an interview made months ago with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s former communist party leader, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, whose 1968 political reforms were crushed by a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion. `` You can write in the constitution that the -LRB- communist -RRB- party is the leading power, but that does n't mean anything by itself,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> asserted. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who has compared his attempts at reform with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies, urged the <LOCATION> Czechoslovak </LOCATION> leadership to follow <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s example. Months before it disbanded and was replaced by the newly created <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 7, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s communist party directly criticized the 1968 <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion _ the only Soviet bloc communist party to do so. That move, along with a spate of newspaper articles and radio and television programs siding with the 1968 reformers on occasion of the Aug. 21 anniversary of the invasion, drew a formal Czechoslovak protest. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> on Monday assailed the detention of a Hungarian reporter by Czechoslovak police over the weekend and the ousting of other Hungarian journalists trying to cover the Aug. 21 anniversary in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. In a statement carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency, the federation urged Czechoslovak authorities to observe international norms on human rights and on freedom of information. It also scolded <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for recently expelling some Hungarian reporters.

 A convict armed with a homemade knife held a doctor and three workers hostage for five hours at a state prison Monday, and surrendered after talking with the head of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' penal system, authorities said The prisoner had demanded to see Corrections Department Director <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, who flew to the maximum-security <LOCATION> Stateville </LOCATION> Correctional Center from the state capital of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. The doctor and three dental clinic workers were taken hostage about 2 p.m. in the prison medical unit, said <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nic </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>. The hostages were released unharmed about five hours later. The inmate, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRue </PERSON>, 35, had been transferred to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state in an exchange of troublemaking inmates, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> LaRue </PERSON> had asked for an airplane to return him to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. `` He's given me a letter that's articulated a number of things, but principally, he does n't want to be in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. `` I think that he does not want to be locked up.'' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> agreed to transfer the inmate to another prison. The prison was immediately placed on a lockdown status, with inmates confined to their cells, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> LaRue </PERSON> had an extensive record in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, including arrests for burglary, assault and posession of a weapon by an inmate, according to records in the Corrections Department. He had been serving a 10-year sentence for assault, said a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. While in prison, <PERSON> Larue </PERSON> was sentenced to three years for possession of a weapon and then was sentenced to 20 years on two assault charges, she said. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said <PERSON> LaRue </PERSON> was transferred from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state system to federal prison because he was a troublemaker.

<HEAD>Boeing Military Airplanes to Pay $11 Million to the Federal Government</HEAD>

 The head of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s military aircraft division signed an agreement Monday requiring the company to pay the federal government $ 11 million in connection with allegations of overcharges on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contracts, officials said. The signing by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> was announced by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has denied any wrongdoing in the case, characterizing the dispute as a good-faith disagreement over pricing procedures. In the settlement, the company did not acknowledge the validity of the government's claims. However, a document reportedly presented to federal grand jurors contained a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> official's calculations of how much money would be generated by the overcharges. Under the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> must pay the $ 11 million within five days. The agreement says <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> wo n't face civil or criminal prosecution in the case, except possible <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> claims. `` We're certainly pleased that an amicable settlement could be reached,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Richhard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON> refused to discuss the company's potential <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> liability in the case or how the alleged overcharges occurred. The case involved contracts for new aluminum skins, or outer coverings, on KC-135 refueling tankers and transports from 1974 to 1986. Government investigators alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> overcharged for aluminum raw materials by quoting supplier catalog prices instead of their actual costs, which were 12 percent to 13 percent less. During <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contract negotiations, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is required to certify the raw materials prices it quotes are current, accurate and complete. An investigation into the case began in 1985. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, where the division is based, heard hundreds of hours of testimony, and inspected thousands of documents for more than nine months before the case was withdrawn by prosecutors late last month. In addition to the other terms of the settlement, the agreement prohibits <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> from charging any of its costs or legal fees in the settlement to government accounts or on future government contrcats. The divison's parent company is based in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>.

 Prospective jurors in the trial of a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police officer who shot a black motorcyclist to death were asked Monday whether the threat of racial violence would influence their verdict. People were called into the courtroom one at a time from a jury pool created last week and questioned closely by attorneys about their knowledge of the Jan. 16 shooting that sparked three days of rioting. The trial of Colombian-born <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 30, has raised concern among local officials about another violent reaction in the community, which has seen several racial eruptions this decade after the slayings of blacks by police and the acquittals of police officers after trials. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> is charged with two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, who was shot in the head while being chased by police, and <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, who suffered fatal injuries when the bike crashed. As the trial's second week began Monday, lead prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> estimated that seating a six-member jury and four alternates would take at least two weeks. But Monday's relatively brisk pace could mean a jury will be seated more quickly. `` I assumed we'd have a lot more trouble than this,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. When the session ended for the day, nine people were retained as prospective jurors and five were excused. Among those excused were three people who said they had formed strong opinions on the case. Most of the people questioned said they knew very little about the case. Attorneys for both sides questioned prospective jurors on the past riots and asked if they could remain impartial despite the threat of violence looming over this trial. A white woman in her 50s, who said she followed the case in newspapers and on television, said she could n't put aside her fears of possible violence. `` It's frightening,'' she said. `` You're afraid that if you were on the jury and brought in a verdict the black community did n't want to hear, there'd be rioting. She was dismissed. A black woman, who works as a bus-maintenance clerk, said she had not formed an opinion about the <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> case. Asked about past riots, she said, `` I do n't believe in violence. We all suffer from it.'' But she indicated that the threat of violence would not affect her verdict if she were on the jury. `` Whatever happens, happens,'' she said. She was told to remain as the jury-selection process continued. The shooting, which occurred on the birthday of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> during the week leading up to the Super Bowl, left one person dead and caused millions in property damage. The defense says <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> shot in self-defense. His attorney, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, won the acquittal of then-Miami officer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> in the 1982 shooting of a young black man at a video arcade in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, just blocks from where <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> were killed. That slaying and the innocent verdict in 1984 triggered racial violence, as did the acquittal of five <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> officers tried in 1980 in the beating death of a black motorcyclist after a chase.

 The District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 homicide toll already equals last year's record of 369 killings _ with more than half blamed on drug-related violence _ and officials say they see no end in sight. With two months remaining in 1989, district police reported that five slayings discovered during a seven-hour period over the weekend brought the tally to last year's record death total. Three of the weekend killings were linked to drugs. The other two were a 13-year-old girl and her aunt who were found stabbed to death in their apartment Saturday. Police blame more than 60 percent of the district's slayings on drugs, particularly the arrival of crack cocaine.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tesh </PERSON> is best known as co-host of `` Entertainment Tonight,'' but he's no `` <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> One-Note </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Tesh </PERSON> is an Emmy-winning composer who recently scored his first movie, `` Limit Up,'' which stars <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON>. His album, `` Garden City,'' named after his hometown in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, is also just out. `` In the past I've composed mostly for television sports shows,'' he said. `` Scoring a movie is very different from doing an album. You do an album for yourself. You decide what it should sound like, how long the pieces will be. `` With film you work for the director. He tells you what he wants. But it's a tradeoff because you get to work with pictures. It forces you to work in ways you had n't thought about.'' <PERSON> Tesh </PERSON> spends most of his time as co-host with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of the daily syndicated `` Entertainment Tonight.'' However, he's been an avid musician all his life and during five years as a CBS Sports reporter he composed the music for the shows he worked on. In 1987 he won an Emmy for best original score for the Tour de France bicycle race. He also did the on-the-scene commentary. `` When I went to CBS Sports I was hired as both an announcer and composer. I did a lot of their sports themes. When I wet to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for the bicycle race I took all my instruments and whacked away. I reported on the race, wrote all the copy, wrote all the music, played it and did the mix for the satellite feed. `` That sums up what I do well. It allowed me to use all my talents. I'm a reasonably good writer and a reasonably good performer. When that won the Emmy it let people in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> know that I was n't just the co-host of ` Entertainment Tonight.' People took a second look. I got an agent and the assignment for ` Limit Up.''' <PERSON> Tesh </PERSON> grew up on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where he studied music with teachers from <PERSON> Juilliard </PERSON> and was twice named to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> State Symphonic Band. He majored in music and communications at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I grew up influenced by the Beatles and Stones. In elementary school, for music I picked drums. My second choice was guitar, which they did n't offer, and my third was trumpet, which is what I got. I had already been studying piano. `` When I joined a rock band nobody was playing keyboard then, so I got my dad to loan me money for a Magnus chord organ. On our gigs I'd stick a microphone next to it to amplify the sound. It worked on air instead of electronics so it did n't sound instantly. I had to play ahead of the rest of the band.'' In college, <PERSON> Tesh </PERSON> began announcing at school dances, then became a disc jockey on the school radio station. His first job after college was as a producer and reporter on a television station in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. He soon became anchorman at $ 125 a week. Next, he went to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` I only stayed there five months. I considered myself a serious journalist and I left after the general manager wanted me to cover his wife's garden party. I went to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> as anchorman. My weather reporter was <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON> and my co-anchor was <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who's also on ` The Pat Sajak Show.' <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> was on the TV station across the street. `` I kept doing music on the side. I always wanted to be a successful musician. I nearly went to a station in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> but I'd also sent an audition tape to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and I was hired for their <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> station. From there I went to CBS Sports.'' He was working on an event in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1986 when he got a call from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> asking him to come to `` Entertainment Tonight.''

 Two decades after it set out to measure things by the millimeter, liter and kilogram, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is part way there but still not very enthusiastic about it. Shillings and sixpences are gone, and the liter _ spelled litre here _ is showing up at gasoline stations. But miles are still the measure of the highways, and pounds and kilograms depend on where you shop. `` Every retailer is afraid to change,'' said <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, an economist who has advised the government on going metric. `` No one will go out on a limb for metric because they fear people might go to the next shop.'' `` I have n't personally gone metric,'' said Sir <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Padmore </PERSON>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Metrication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1969 to oversee the transition. `` My principal hobby is gardening and I still use a gallon can. There is total confusion in buying things like pesticides, which are marked half in metric, half in imperial measure, and some people are extremely tiresome about it.'' <PERSON> Padmore </PERSON>, who is 80, added: `` Older citizens my age think it's a damn nuisance.'' As a member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is part of the tariff-free 12-nation trading bloc that will come into existence at the end of 1992, and the resulting economic harmony will put the British imperial system of weights and measures all the more out of step. Thus, by order of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, gills, gallons, feet, fathoms, pounds and ounces are to be phased out by the turn of the century. The idea is to use the metric system for everything that is negotiated across borders. Thus acres stay, as does the mile; the cost of replacing every road sign in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> would be enormous. Also saved are the furlong, a measure of horse-racing distance; the troy ounce, in which gold bullion is traded, and the pint for milk or a beer at the pub. The British also will still be able to weigh themselves in stones, units of 14 pounds. Loose goods such as vegetables will stay imperial until 1999, but packaged goods must come by the kilogram by 1995. The country's mistrust of the metric system dates to at least 1791, when it declined <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s invitation to join in establishing an international system devised by the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Not until 1897 did Parliament legalize the use of metric measures in trade and commerce. In 1965, Prime Minister <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> pledged <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would go metric, but he foresaw the problems when he remarked that the British `` do n't like four-syllable words like metrication.'' Indeed, `` popping down to the pub for a 0.568 of a liter'' never seemed likely to catch on, which is why the pint stays. A public opinion poll in 1970 indicated that most people preferred the imperial measures. Fifty-seven percent opposed going metric and only one-third said they understood the system, even though it should be a lot simpler, since it works in multiples of 10 as opposed to the 12-inch foot, eight-pint gallon and 5,280-foot mile. A government pin-up attempted the metric-is-beautiful approach by showing bikini-clad <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> with vital statistics in millimeters _ 914-610-914. THINK METRIC, the poster exhorted, but Ms. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> did n't help things by confessing a preference for inches. `` Millimeters sound so enormous that it is rather unflattering,'' the model said. In inches, she's a 36-24-36. The currency was changed in the early 1970s. Out went shillings, sixpences and half-crowns in favor of a decimal system whereby the 240-penny pound became the 100-pence pound. Despite intense grumbling from traditionalists, decimalization worked. Schoolchildren began learning the metric system in 1974, and it looked as though the 1979 deadline for full metrication would be met. But in 1979 a poll found 46 percent still opposing metrication, and today, says the National Consumer Council, British consumers have the worst of both worlds. `` Consumers find that comparison of goods is made much more difficult by the fact that products are often measured in different ways in different shops,'' the council said. `` Conversion from one system to the other is neither quick nor simple.'' The Confederation of British Industry -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- favors metrication to increase foreign trade and is confident its members will be ready by 1992. `` In principle we should do all we can to extend our trading markets,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scates </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION>. `` British industry must give the customers what they want or you're asking for trouble because the next guy will please the customer.''

<HEAD>Severe Housing Shortage Afflicts Wealthy West Germany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Affluent young executives flocking to West German cities like this scenic <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> metropolis have a problem in common with the poor immigrants crowding in from the East. Hundreds of thousands of them can find no place to live. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, one of the world's wealthiest nations, has been plunged into a housing crisis by its own prosperity. Demographic and economic warps have coincided to flood the market with homeseekers at a time when the supply of new public and private housing is virtually nil due to a construction lag five years ago. `` Our postwar baby boom came along a little later than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and we are now seeing hordes of young people with good educations and good incomes flooding the housing market,'' said <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampmann </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tenants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors rental conditions nationwide. `` They can afford better housing, and they want it, but it just is n't there.'' The housing shortage loomed long before a wave of East European refugees hit this year, but that influx expected to reach 500,000 by year's end has greatly aggravated the problem. The nation is now short about 800,000 homes. A million other households are in need of major renovation. Thousands of recent arrivals from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> sleep on cots in converted concert halls or in makeshift metal housing erected on sports fields. The hundreds of thousands of upmarket homeless usually crowd in with relatives or friends during the hunt for housing, which can take years. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> suffer the most acute shortages, but officials concede the problem has reached crisis proportions in virtually every city. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has declared housing the No. 1 budget priority for next year and has promised special funds for new construction this year and a review of tax and rent-control laws. Paradoxically, hundreds of thousands of potential apartments are kept off the market by landlords in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because of tax consequences or building restrictions that prevent conversion of attics and lofts. Pressure from all income brackets is mounting, and tales of apartment-hunting woes abound. Desperate homeseekers advertise any way they can. A man in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> painted an appeal on the back of his leather jacket. Many put up notices on trees and light standards. `` Desperate, well-paid two-income couple with small child will pay 800 marks -LRB- $ 420 -RRB- for information leading to obtaining a three-room or larger apartment,'' said one of hundreds of such notices posted in the <LOCATION> Suedstadt </LOCATION> neighborhood in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the capital. `` Non-smoking medical student seeks any room for 1989-90 study year,'' a <LOCATION> Heidelberg </LOCATION> man, <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Schimpf </PERSON>, has likewise announced. <PERSON> Heike </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a 29-year-old journalist in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, said the apartment shortage allows landlords to pick and choose tenants to the point of discrimination. `` Landlords wo n't rent to students and single people because they think you're going to wreck the place,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, who shares an apartment with two roommates. While West Germans have more money to invest as their economy booms, housing construction is a long-term investment with lots of risks. Crowded with industry and covered with a spider's web of freeways from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Bavarian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION>, little open land is available for new suburban housing. Environmental codes strictly limit construction in urban areas, and building and labor costs have risen so sharply that rents double the going rate would have to be charged to recover construction costs. A rent-control law has kept prices relatively stable at the equivalent of about $ 600 to $ 725 a month for a 1,000 square feet of living space. About 60 percent of West German households are renters. The German Home, Apartment and <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> contends the government will have to loosen regulations to encourage owners to rent second homes and spare rooms. Its president, <PERSON> Theodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, says 225,000 more dwellings could be brought into the market if owners could see a profit in it.

 It is still a crime to insult the royal family in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, as a 24-year-old Dutchman recently learned when he was fined 500 guilders -LRB- $ 230 -RRB- for displaying a poster depicting Queen <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON> as a pig. Most Dutch frown on insults to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION>, whose fate and fortunes have been entwined with the Low Countries for 400 years. Periodic polls indicate the public overwhelmingly favors retaining its constitutional monarchy. `` The Orange family belongs to the antique furniture that we've inherited, and it would be unwise to do away with it _ they might be very valuable,'' said historian <PERSON> Coenraad </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamse </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Groningen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> `` They offer a simple icon of the continuity of Dutch national identity.'' Since 1898, the Dutch have been led by three queens _ the dour <PERSON> Wilhelmina </PERSON>, a symbol of hope during the five-year Nazi occupation; the motherly <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON>, and now the practical <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON>, who has a strong sense of her role in Dutch life. `` <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON> has a very strong notion of historic continuity, even though nothing could be further apart than the role of 16th-century <PERSON> William </PERSON> and hers,'' said royalty writer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lammers </PERSON>, referring to Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Orange </PERSON>, who led the Dutch fight for independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in the 16th century. Although the 51-year-old <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON> is far from a figurehead, her official statements are closely tailored to fit the policy of the elected government. An attractive woman with the characteristic ruddy cheeks of her countrymen, <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON> is unpretentious in public and dresses like a prosperous middle-class matron. She and her husband, <PERSON> Claus </PERSON>, a former West German diplomat, mix easily with the public and eschew extravagance. But <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON> reportedly is concerned with maintaining respect for the monarchy and insists on being called `` Majesty,'' rather than `` Ma'am,'' which her mother <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> preferred. Over the centuries, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> has survived financial and romantic scandal, as well as occupation by <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s forces in 1795-1812 and by <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s in 1940-45. Both times its members fled to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Its current hallowed image dates from <LOCATION> Wilhelmina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON>'s grandmother, who was `` groomed to fit the mold formed by the supposed Dutch national traits: virtuousness, diligence, charity, religiosity, and aversion to violence,'' Professor <PERSON> Tamse </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilhelmina </PERSON>'s bond with her people was irrevocably forged by her frequent morale-boosting radio speeches from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> during World War II. Periodic scandals have failed to tarnish the Orange image. During the 1950s there was Queen <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON>'s reported dependence on a faith healer, which the media attributed to her depression over the near-blindness of her daughter, Princess <PERSON> Christina </PERSON>, born in 1947. In 1964, daughter Princess <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> enraged hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> factions by rejecting the royal family's Dutch Reformed Protestant faith for Roman Catholicism to marry Prince <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourbon-Parma </PERSON>, who now is King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON>, was Dutch industry's unofficial ambassador until his implication in the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> bribery scandal in 1975 He was stripped of his rank as inspector-general of the Dutch armed forces but is still highly popular and active in conservation issues. Even the royal family's wealth _ reported to range from $ 80 million to $ 4.4 billion _ has failed to incite popular resentment. <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON> and her family live in <LOCATION> Huis </LOCATION> ten <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> -LRB- House in the Woods -RRB-, an estate in The Hague visible from the public highway. Except for state occasions, <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON> is driven around in a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. Their three sons study in the state-run university system and room with friends. The heaviest public insult to the monarchy came in 1980, when <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> abdicated in favor of <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON>. During the inauguration _ Dutch monarchs are not crowned _ stone-throwing squatters rioted outside. `` In hindsight, the inauguration riots had less to do with the monarchy than with anything else _ the housing situation, unemployment, and the like,'' writer <PERSON> Lammers </PERSON> said. `` But as national symbols, the royals bore the brunt of the unrest.'' Despite her circumscribed role, <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON>'s interest in government is keen, according to sources close to the royal family. She meets every Monday morning with Premier <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> and has at least one extensive policy discussion a week with other Cabinet ministers. The royals draw a line at exploitation of their private life by the popular press. Four years ago, <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> obtained a court-ordered retraction from a Dutch magazine for an unsubstantiated story alleging that their eldest son, Crown Prince <PERSON> Willem-Alexander </PERSON>, spent the night with a `` mysterious blonde'' in an <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> hotel.

<HEAD>In Peruvian Port, Shopkeepers Speak Russian</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CALLAO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dirty, decayed, haunted by hoodlums, prostitutes and drug addicts, this fogbound seaport is not much different from any other <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> port of call _ except here, the shopkeepers speak Russian. More than 200 ships of the Soviet fishing fleet operating in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> use <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION> as a resupply point under a contract signed by the two countries in 1971. For the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION> represents an important but controversial foothold in a region where Soviet influence has been limited. About 30,000 Soviet crewmen a year, on six-month stints, shuttle in and out on <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> flights to nearby <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s capital. The sailors, the most visible sign of the Soviet presence in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, have become prominent targets for leftist terrorists, however. On July 5, a terrorist bomb tossed beneath a tour bus wounded 20 sailors from the fleet on a shopping and sightseeing trip. Many of the wounded were badly maimed and burned. Six Soviet fishermen also were wounded in 1986 when a bomb hidden under a pile of sweaters went off in a clothing shop frequented by the sailors in <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION>. Police attributed the attacks to the Shining Path, a leftist insurgent group fighting since 1980 to topple <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s government and install a workers' and peasants' state patterned on the ideas of the late Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The group also has attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> office in downtown <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and a Peru-Soviet cultural center. On Oct. 25 rebels in a passing car hurled dynamite at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, damaging a diplomat's car but causing no injuries. It was the second attack on the embassy in three years. In 1986 the Maoist guerrillas assaulted it with explosives and submachine guns. One rebel penetrated the embassy compound but was blown up when a bomb exploded in his hands. The Shining Path views the current Soviet and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> governments as traitors to true Marxism and regards the Soviets as enemies because they have been a major supplier of arms to the Peruvian armed forces for the past two decades. Just before the July 5 bus bombing, the government announced it had purchased four Soviet helicopter gunships for its fight against the insurgents. Close relations between <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> go back to the late 1960s, when the leftist military dictatorship of Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON> realigned Peruvian foreign relations toward the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON> outfitted his army and air force with Soviet arms and aircraft, and despite subsequent changes in government <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> remains dependant on the Soviets for training and spare parts. Today the country is the third largest purchaser of Soviet military hardware in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, after <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` They are inhibited from turning away from the Soviet influence because of decisions made 20 years ago,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat. `` They're hooked onto the chain.'' Although staggered by a huge budget deficit and a $ 17 billion foreign debt, the government is planning to buy 14 more helicopters for use by its counterinsurgency forces. The government uses the fishing contract to help pay its debts with the Soviets, almost all of which is for arms purchases. The agreement allows Soviet trawlers to harvest 400,000 tons of fish a year inside <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 200-mile territorial-water limit. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> takes 17.5 percent of the catch. Critics complain the Soviets take as much as $ 1.5 billion worth of fish each year without paying taxes and accuse the government of doing little to control the take. `` They can fish where, when and as much as they want,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterling </PERSON>, who submitted a formal complaint to the government in April charging the fishing contract was unconstitutional. The left-leaning government of President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> has not responded to the complaint. But businesses in blighted <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION> welcome the tall blond fishermen. `` Sweaters _ the cheapest; blue jeans, imported watches, and they carry away lots of brown leather jackets,'' said <PERSON> Angelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Casana </PERSON>, owner of a store that sells Peruvian handicrafts. `` They take special sizes because they are very big.'' The terrorist threat, however, has caused business to drop off in <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION> as the sailors try to maintain a low profile, she added. `` It's affected them, the fear,'' she said. `` They do n't come like they used to, and some shops have closed up and left.''

It was the 1,686 th day in captivity for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> services for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> It was national Hostage Awareness Day by act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, although not a lot of people seemed to be aware of it. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, there is a daily reminder of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s long ordeal; Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, issues it at each day's session, placing in the Congressional Record a speech, an article or a count of the number of days <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has been held. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> repeated its familiar call for release of the hostages on Friday, urging those who hold them to immediately and unconditionally free all the hostages. `` No political cause can justify these criminal acts,'' the department said in words used over and over again during two administrations. Earlier in the week, the Shiite Moslem extremists who seized and hold <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> played out their part in the ritual, frustrating evidence of the sameness and futility in it all. They repeated in the autumn of 1989 the demand with which they began in the spring of 1985, for the release of 15 Moslem terrorists imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. With the demand, once again, came an instant photograph of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, captive and incommunicado somewhere in the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> area since he was seized by gunmen on March 16, 1985. The photo was similar to one released by the captors nearly a year ago. American officials have said all along that they do not control the Kuwaiti prisoners, convicted in 1983 in embassy bombings that killed five people, and that they would not make deals with hostage-takers anyhow. The demand from Islamic Jihad, which also holds hostage <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 57, came a day after the new president of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> suggested there might be another way out for the captive Americans, and was read by some diplomats as a militant answer to the message from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would try to help get the hostages freed if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agrees to release Iranian assets frozen in the <LOCATION> Teheran </LOCATION> embassy hostage crisis of 1979. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also should help determine what happened to three Iranian diplomats kidnapped in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982 and believed to be dead. Those, too, are familiar demands. And they drew a familiar response. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said no deals for hostages, and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no new information about the three Iranians. The dispute over frozen assets, money and military equipment, is in the hands of a special tribunal in The Hague, which periodically releases funds it determines are owed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Our position has not changed, that we do not link the Iranian assets to the hostages, and we do not make deals for hostages,'' said <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the White House press secretary. Eight Americans and 10 other Westerners are held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, by militant <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> groups aligned with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But the Iranian government always has disclaimed direct knowledge or control of the captives, and <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> did so again. Administration officials now believe that the hostage situation will be resolved only as part of a broader settlement including some normalization of relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came to office saying he looked to a day of improved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and inviting <LOCATION> Teheran </LOCATION> to move toward it by helping gain freedom for the captives. The policy is unchanged. So is the plight of the hostages _ `` year after frustrating year,'' as <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, said at the birthday Mass. `` It is hope that motivates us to approach every ceremony as if it would be the last,'' said Mrs. Say, a leader among the hostage families. But there was no one to suggest anything more than hope; no new policy, no promise, no sign of movement. Only the ritual farewells, spoken with the suggestion that the next hostage ceremony must, at last, celebrate freedom instead of marking bondage.

 The sound of classical music drifts from a large upstairs dressing room at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre one hour before an evening dress rehearsal. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> is playing <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>. `` I think it helps to concentrate on something else for a minute or two,'' says <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON>, better known as rock superstar Sting, as he gets up from the piano. `` Otherwise, you end up worrying.'' What occupies most of his time these days is `` 3 Penny Opera,'' a revival of the <PERSON> Bertolt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brecht-Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> musical about the underworld of Victorian <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. In it, Sting plays <ORGANIZATION> Macheath </ORGANIZATION>, a rakish brigand nicknamed <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> the Knife. <ORGANIZATION> Macheath </ORGANIZATION> is a cutthroat criminal, not to mention a devilishly handsome bounder and a ladies man. The 38-year-old former bass player and singer for the Police certainly looks the part. The golden locks have been cut and slicked back. A mustache slashes the upper lip. But the eyes are as blue and as mesmerizing as when he first filled stadiums and arenas across the country singing such hits as `` Roxanne'' and `` Every Breath You Take.'' `` 3 Penny Opera'' opens Nov. 5 on Broadway after a bumpy out-of-town tryout. Reviews in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were unfavorable, especially for its star. `` If you're going to see Sting, prepare to be stung,'' sniffed one critic. `` Slow and turgid stuff,'' said another. Cast members reportedly were seen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> auditioning for jobs in other upcoming musicals. But director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> and his company have worked furiously on the show, and word of mouth, particularly during the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> previews, has improved. `` I've learned an awful lot,'' Sting says. `` I know the character is more convincing now than he was when I started rehearsals in August. There's more of me in <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON>. You start with a mask and you inject it with bits of yourself. I'm not saying you become a murderer or a particularly bad person, but there are moments in your life when you could be that person.'' What has surprised the man who is making his Broadway debut in the musical? `` I thought I would be less involved creatively. I thought I would learn the lines, learn the blocking and just do it the same way every night. It does n't happen that way. The show is different every night. Everybody's changing slightly. So the changes you do have a domino effect.'' <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON>, who won a Tony award in 1988 for directing `` M. Butterfly,'' has a reputation as a tough taskmaster. `` He's very demanding, but I find working with him very refreshing because he is very honest,'' Sting says. `` If you're being rotten, he'll tell you A good director holds a mirror up to you and says: ` This is good or bad. And it's your fault.' So I know he's telling the truth.'' `` 3 Penny Opera'' is not Sting's first venture into the music of <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>. Three years ago, he recorded `` The Ballad of Mack the Knife'' and later performed <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>'s music with the <ORGANIZATION> Hamburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` It's very strange music to sing,'' Sting says. `` <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> was a student of <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON>, a very serious music man, and yet he basically wrote pop music at the end of his career. He moved toward pop music. `` That's an interesting point for me because I'm a pop musician and I'm going the other way. His music is demanding. It has its roots in European music but it also is very influenced by jazz.'' `` 3 Penny Opera'' was a quick flop when it was first done on Broadway in 1933, but an off-Broadway revival in the mid-1950s -LRB- starring <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Lotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenya </PERSON> -RRB- ran for more than 2,600 performances. The odd spelling of the title, instead of the more traditional `` Threepenny Opera,'' was done to signify that this is a new translation, done by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Feingold </PERSON>. The new stage production was the brainchild of producer <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellman </PERSON>, best known as the man behind such movies as `` Midnight Cowboy'' and `` Coming Home.'' <PERSON> Hellman </PERSON> and Sting are neighbors in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and he persuaded the rock star to try the stage. Sting, whose father was a milkman in the working-class town of <LOCATION> Newcastle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, studied English in college where he prepared to be teacher. But he left teaching behind when he moved to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` I wanted to be a musician,'' he says. And he did, primarily in jazz, before the Police was formed in 1977. He's had the name `` Sting'' since he was 18, when he wore black and yellow sweaters that made him look, according to a friend, like a bee. Sting has been seriously studying singing for the last 10 years _ `` to try and get out of my bad habits.'' `` 3 Penny Opera'' was n't miked in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but complaints about the sound _ or lack of it _ brought out the microphones. `` But it's very subtle,'' Sting says. `` They do n't make your ears bleed like ours do when we play concerts.'' The rock star has worked on his speaking voice, too, trying to make it as resonant as his singing voice, and even has taken tap-dancing lessons. `` Not because there's any tap dancing in the show,'' he says. `` I thought if I was going to learn dancing, I would try to learn some of the most demanding dancing there is. It's brainwork, more than anything else, trying to remember to tap so many steps to the left and so many to right.'' Sting's commitment to `` 3 Penny Opera'' is for nine months, the longest he has been in one place in 15 years. A new album, a concert tour and a new movie will have to wait until the show closes. `` It's demanding because of the process of adding, subtracting and changing,'' he said. `` I'll probably go crazy, but I wo n't be bored. Definitely not bored.'' But that's the reason he did the show in the first place. `` I do n't know what the fallout from this thing will be _ positive or negative,'' he says. `` I have no way of predicting it. That's one of the exciting things about it. The important thing is that I'm learning something. I think that's how I genuinely value success or failure now.''

 <PERSON> Szilard </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to introduce himself to <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> with the idea, unavailing, of licensing his books in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The young scientist felt a personal calling to rescue the world from itself through a brotherhood of its best and brightest. While failing with <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, <PERSON> Szilard </PERSON> filed away in the drawers of his memory an apocalyptic preview from <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' 1914 book, `` The World Set Free,'' which forecast catastrophic destruction by atomic bombs. C.P. Snow, the reverse of <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> as a physicist who wrote novels, said <PERSON> Szilard </PERSON> possessed an `` invulnerable egocentricity.'' But he also, said a French biologist, was `` as generous with his ideas as a <ORGANIZATION> Maori </ORGANIZATION> chief with his wives.'' He was given to long, reflective walks but felt `` there is no place as good to think as the bathtub.'' He would towel off after several hours of immersion and apply for patents on his soap-born ideas. When the American <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> invented the cyclotron in 1930, which permitted firing subatomic particles at <LOCATION> Rutherford </LOCATION>'s nuclei, <PERSON> Szilard </PERSON> had already applied for a patent on a similar device a year before In any case, it was a new tool, something the Americans were particularly good at inventing, to look more deeply into the atom. In 1932 <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON>'s lab in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> identified the uncharged atomic particle, the neutron. Science now had a bullet to fire at the nucleus of the atom without electrical interference from its satellites. As science edged closer to the heart of the matter and the immense power <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> had postulated that lay there, its practitioners were motivated by scientific venturing with slight thought of other consequences. An atomic bomb? <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON>, a British physicist who as <LOCATION> Lord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cherwell </LOCATION> was to become <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s wartime science adviser, said in the 1930s he `` could scarcely believe that the universe was constructed in this way'' as to make the atom a weapon. In September 1933 <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> reiterated `` moonshine'' at a public seminar and was quoted in a report of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. -LRB- Privately <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> cautioned the <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> `` to keep an eye on the matter.'' -RRB- Also in that paper had been a review of Wells' latest book. As it happened, one of the newspaper's readers was <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Szilard </PERSON>. With his usual prescience, he had seen where the anti-Semitism of `` Mein Kampf'' was leading <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and left the day before emigration fell under Aryan restrictions. On a dank, lugubrious day in that September of 1933, <PERSON> Szilard </PERSON> went for a walk. At one point he stopped for a red light near the British Museum. But his mind kept on motoring. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' atomic bombs, <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON>'s moonshine, flipped through his mind as did thoughts on chemistry. There were such things in chemistry as chain reactions, but they curtailed themselves eventually. But what if a Rutherfordian atomic nucleus could be split by one of his neutrons such as shot by one of <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s cyclotrons? Would the nucleus release other neutrons to hit other nuclei and so on in a chain reaction to release <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>'s postulated energy? Thus the chain reaction of a scientific mind while waiting for a light to turn green. In time <PERSON> Szilard </PERSON> would apply for a patent on an atomic chain reaction. Not for the money. No, the purpose was to ensure a safer and better world. He was concerned about `` disasters'' that might occur if `` certain powers might attack this country.'' He had learned from <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> that only the military could keep a patent classified in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Szilard </PERSON> applied to the War Office. It turned him down. He tried the Admiralty with an accompanying letter from <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON>. It was hardly alarmist or wholehearted. ``... even if the chances were a hundred to one against it,'' <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> wrote, `` it seems to me it might be worth keeping the thing secret as it is not going to cost the Government anything. Secrecy was alien to science where new-found knowledge is a torch passed from one lab experiment to another for the greater good of all. As <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> said of the process, he had been able to see so far only because `` I have stood on the shoulders of giants.'' One such giant of physics between the world wars was <ORGANIZATION> Enrico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fermi </ORGANIZATION>, an Italian physicist of magnetic charm and such infallibility he was nicknamed `` the Pope.'' Born in 1901, he had been engrossed in physics since adolescence when he bought two old books on the subject and read them through at once _ in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION>. An experimenter known for exquisite precision, he could also ad-lib with what was on hand, at one point using a goldfish pond to moderate neutrons he bombarded all the elements with. Uranium responded exotically, resulting in a new element for which <ORGANIZATION> Fermi </ORGANIZATION> won the 1938 Nobel prize. But he had seen so far and no further. <PERSON> Fermi </PERSON> took his family with him to <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> to receive the prize. They kept right on going to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Fermi </PERSON> was Jewish. Unwittingly, the sinister anti-Semitism of `` Mein Kampf'' made an incalculable contribution to the development of the atomic bomb. At a stroke, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Aryan laws barring universities to Jews reduced <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s physicists by a quarter. <PERSON> Szilard </PERSON> had fled <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and so had his countrymen <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigner </PERSON>. As the `` Hungarian Conspiracy,'' they would be an instrumental trio in the crucial year of 1939.

 An Austrian Jew had forecast the diaspora: `` The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> would pray for the victims, the British would organize their rescue, and the Americans would pay for it.'' In the end, the Axis paid for the flight of Jewish science from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Niels </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohr </PERSON>, a rugged theoretician who excelled at soccer and transcended in physics to become a national hero, was a clearinghouse of atomic information as well as a haven for emigre Jewish researchers. One of those who escaped to <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> was a young physicist, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>. His aunt, <PERSON> Lise </PERSON> <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON>, a chemist, continued working at the <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilhelm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. As an Austrian she was not subject to <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Aryan laws. She was born in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in 1886 and became only the second woman there to earn a doctorate. She was accepted for further study at <ORGANIZATION> KWI </ORGANIZATION> on the proviso that as a woman she never show her face above her lab in the woodshop in the basement. A pretty but shy young woman whose love in her life was science, she accepted such exile. She formed a long and close partnership with <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, also a chemist. He was a handsome, gregarious outdoorsman. During World War I he had worked on the dark side of chemistry _ helping with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s poison gas detachments. He justified it as a means, however murderous, of saving more lives by shortening the war. The thought was not original with wartime scientists, then or later. Although they never even lunched together, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> were a close team, talking over their work on the atom's mysteries on long walks, walking having played an inordinate role in the atom's deciphering When <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s troops marched into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in 1938, <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> lost her immunity. She hurriedly packed to leave for the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. In farewell, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> gave her a treasured diamond ring that had been his mother's. `` I wanted her to be provided for in an emergency.'' <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Himmler </PERSON>, head of the SS, had closed the border to fleeing scholastics. <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> tried to look composed as soldiers examined her passport. `` I knew that the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> had just declared open season on the Jews, that the hunt was on. For 10 minutes I sat there and waited, 10 minutes that seemed like so many hours.'' Then the soldiers passed her over the border. Unaware, they had let a genie out of a bottle. Back in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> continued bombarding uranium, now with <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON>. In early December of 1938 <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON>, now in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, that something most unusual had happened. He and <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> had found after one experiment that the uranium seemed to have divided into two isotopes of barium whose weight did not quite duplicate the weight of the original target. Although <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> had a good idea of what had happened, he asked <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> for her thoughts. And wished her a `` bearable Christmas.'' <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> was spending the holiday with friends near <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION>. There she was joined by <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>, whose father was still interned in the concentration camp at <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION> following the anti-Jewish pogrom of Kristallnacht. On Christmas Eve, <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> wanted to go cross-country skiing. <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> said she would walk along. Frish feared she could n't keep up. Oh yes, she could, <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> insisted. She wanted to talk with <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> about <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s news. <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> wanted to talk about a magnet he had designed. `` Finally we became absorbed in my problem,'' she recalled. They sat down on a log and began sketching with a piece of paper and a pencil <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> had in her purse. She vividly remembered years ago hearing <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> lecture on his theory of relativity and how the E equals mc2 evolved. She made the calculation of what the loss of weight in <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s two barium isotopes had been compared to the uranium in terms of <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>'s formula The weight loss corresponded perfectly with the energy that would been produced. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> had split an atom. Energy was released. A new door had opened on the possibility of a chain reaction. Ironically, only a few days before, <PERSON> Szilard </PERSON>, now in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION>, had written the British Admiralty asking it to withdraw his patent on a chain reaction. The odds of it happening, he explained, had `` just about reached the vanishing point.'' Just after the New Year <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> cautiously wrote <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> that `` perhaps ... such a heavy nucleus bursts.'' On Jan. 3, 1939, <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>, back in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, began outlining what the news from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had been and his discussion about it with his aunt. <PERSON> Bohr </PERSON>'s rapid mind raced ahead of his words. `` Oh, what idiots we have been!'' he said slapping his forehead. `` This is just as it must be!'' <PERSON> Bohr </PERSON> was due to leave in four days for a stint at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. He asked that a blackboard be installed in his stateroom aboard the ship. He had some noodling to do about atoms as he crossed the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. A scientist from the Old World was bearing some startling news to his colleagues in the New.

 It's a handbook for generals and politicians, Wall Streeters and labor leaders, anybody playing to win. It's centuries-old advice from a Chinese militarist who now seems to be upstaging an Italian philosopher whose pragmatic ideas were once considered the gospel for getting ahead

 Move over, <PERSON> Machiavelli </PERSON>. The current bible of play-to-win strategists is no longer that 16th century Italian author's `` The Prince,'' but the much older writings of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military tactician <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON>, assembled as `` The Art of War.'' <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON>'s writings finally reached the Western world in the late 18th century and were reputedly followed by the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese military, Vietnamese guerrilla leader <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> revolutionary leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. The works drew little attention in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until recent years, but have been become increasingly popular. For example: _ <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, perhaps the most hard-nosed political strategist of this decade, is a devotee who reads `` The Art of War'' before every campaign _ <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> machinists union leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, one of the airline industry's most powerful and most controversial labor heads this decade, hands out copies of the <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON> text to all his organizations general chairmen _ And in director <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>'s movie `` Wall Street,'' Oscar-winning actor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' `` greed is good'' character, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekko </PERSON>, advises his protege: `` Read <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON>, ` The Art of War. ` Every battle is won before it's fought.' Think about it.'' Stone, in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> finishing `` Born on the Fourth of July,'' about the life of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War double-amputee <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovic </PERSON> and his anti-war crusade, said that while `` The Art of War'' is n't yet widely read on Wall Street, it was appropriate to the thinking of <PERSON> Gekko </PERSON>, `` ruthless, yet accurate.'' As did <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gekko </PERSON> emphasized the importance of information and use of spies. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who recently read `` The Art of War'' for the 20th-plus time on a flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, calls the book `` the most succinct strategy document ever written.'' `` Everything in it you can relate to my profession, you can relate to the campaign,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> says. `` Every time I read it, I am reminded of something very important.'' Some scholars consider `` The Art of War'' common sense put on paper and do n't quite understand its current popularity. `` It was always around and I personally find it to be a collection of little aphorisms,'' says <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> professor of political science and a student of Chinese military history. `` For example, he says: ` Know your enemy and know yourself.' I think every ghetto kid in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is thinking that before he gets into a fight.'' <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> suspects that one of the reasons the book is so popular is that `` there's a certain panache to quoting an ancient Chinese author.'' <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON>'s emphasis on the aspects of psychology, information-gathering, deception, planning and limiting casualties are applied to many cases by his students. History, they point out, is full of examples of how leaders failed to follow the basic rules of <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Clavell </PERSON>, the author and screenplay writer who has studied Chinese and Japanese military thought, wrote in a foreword to one of the English translations: `` I truly believe that if our military and political leaders in recent times had studied this work of genius, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> could not have happened as it happened. `` We would not have lost the war in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> -LRB- we lost because we did not achieve victory -RRB-, the Bay ofPigs could not have occurred; the hostage fiasco in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would not have come to pass; the British Empire would not have been dismembered, and in all probability, World Wars I and II would have been avoided _ certainly they would not have been waged as they were waged, and the millions of youths obliterated unnecessarily and stupidly by monsters calling themselves generals would have lived out their lives.'' Little is known about the personal background of <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON>, an adviser and general for Chinese warlords. Scholars have differed on when he wrote his guide to warfare, with some saying the seventh century B.C. and others saying the third century. And some have argued that he never existed at all and that `` The Art of War'' is a compilation. <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON> wrote that `` moral law,'' belief in the cause and in the leaders, is crucial to victory, as is command discipline. The object is not to devastate the enemy, but to win with as little actual engagement as possible, he wrote. Among his teachings: _ `` To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.

 _ `` All warfare is based on deception.'' _ `` In war, numbers alone confer no advantage. Do not advance relying on sheer military power.'' _ `` While we have heard of blundering swiftness in war, we have not yet seen a clever operation that was prolonged.'' _ `` War is a matter of vital importance to the state ... It is mandatory that it be thoroughly studied.'' _ `` If you know your enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.'' A desire to know his foe led <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, the union leader, to `` The Art of War'' some 10 years ago. `` There was a rumor that management was using that book,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, who bought copies for himself and his union leadership. `` It's mostly lessons, more on understanding and anticipating the strategy of an adversary and being prepared to deal with it,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, who in 1983 took his union to the brink of a strike before management gave in with a favorable contract. In 1986 he was blamed by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials for forcing the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and this year he led the strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> that began March 4. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> emphasizes gathering information about the company and management and usually keeps his strategy as secret as possible, both Sun Tzu-type attributes. The strategies of <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, also based on personal philosophical and religious beliefs, have come under fire as <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> follows a plan to rebuild Eastern without its unions. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who first read `` The Art of War'' while a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> graduate student, read it again this summer and savored how <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON>'s guidelines had been followed in the 1988 presidential campaign. `` He talks in there repeatedly about keeping your own group united,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> says. `` One of the driving things of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign was keeping united.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> says the importance of laying out a strategy and sticking to it, as taught by <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON>, was demonstrated in the Super Tuesday strategy in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> effectively locked up the Republican nomination with his domination of the South. The plan to use the South to defeat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opponents had been planned for three years, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> says. One of <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s favorite <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzuisms </PERSON> is, `` When you get into the mind of your opponent, you can move it.'' Asked about deception and other <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON> tactics, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> chuckles. `` You'll have to get someone else to make observations on that.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> also read and was influenced by <PERSON> Machiavelli </PERSON>, best known for advising the powerful that the end justifies the means in gaining and maintaining power. `` I think <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON> is a highly refined version of ` The Prince,''' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> says. `` The Art of War'' can be found these days in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military study libraries, and is on a suggested reading list the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> compiled this year. Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> says <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON>'s writings contrast in approach to another highly recommended war strategy work, `` On War,'' by the 19th century Prussian military author <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausewitz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clausewitz </PERSON>'s teachings, contained in 10 to 12 volumes, also combine social, political and personal factors with military strategy. <PERSON> Clausewitz </PERSON> presents his theories `` at extreme length and in excruciating detail,'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> says. `` <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON> wrote his book as a primer for warlords. It's got a lot of pithy little advice, a lot lighter reading.'' <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, a retired Marine brigadier general who translated and published <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON> three decades ago after writing about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s civil war, wrote that `` The Art of War'' should be `` required reading for those who hope to gain a further understanding of the grand strategy'' of both the Soviet and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership. However, Ms. <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> says, the current <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership apparently does n't follow <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON>. Their bloody quelling of the summer's student protests goes against `` The Art of War'' philosophy that says the government must serve the people's interest and maintain national unity The Chinese military's handling of the students, she says, was `` not <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu </PERSON>.''

 Music is mere vibration in the air, and difficult to get your hands on. But there are a lot of dollars in music, and a special kind of private cop is out there to make sure the artists and composers get their share.

 No sirens. No flashing lights. No guns or billy clubs. Just a notebook and a pen and an ear for popular music. These are the jukebox police. They are undercover spies, actually, private citizens backed by civil law. Their duty is to find people who make money from music without paying rights fees to the artists and composers. Some people do n't take them seriously until they find themselves in court being sued for thousands of dollars. `` They think you're kidding,'' says <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropelak </PERSON>, an ex-schoolteacher who patrols <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's not a joke. It's not a scam.'' BMI and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION>, Artists and Publishers are the principal enforcers of music copyright laws. The organizations collect license fees from establishments that use music in nearly every form _ whether it be a bar, a bank or a brothel. `` They are not only the jukebox police, they are the licensers of music throughout an area,'' says <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavin </PERSON>, a private lawyer for BMI. `` If it were n't for BMI or <ORGANIZATION> ASCAP </ORGANIZATION>, every bar and restaurant would have to contact each songwriter individually to get permission to play his music,'' <PERSON> Kropelak </PERSON> says. For jukeboxes, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Copyright Office collects $ 63 for registrations and splits the money among the composers and publishers' agencies. In addition to its field representatives, BMI uses a network of people who log the songs they hear played on the ubiquitous jukeboxes. `` With 50 or so field men, whatever they can do is a drop in the bucket,'' says <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON>, a lawyer for BMI in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Every city, town and street corner has somebody using music. It's a question of having enough hands and feet to get there.'' One logger hit <PERSON> Joey </PERSON>'s Bar and Grill in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, last year after a <LOCATION> Steppenwolf </LOCATION> fan dropped a few quarters in the jukebox and played `` Born To Be Wild'' and `` Magic Carpet Ride. A country-and-western fan punched `` D-I-V-O-R-C-E'' and `` Rocky Top'' and a nostalgic soul played `` Heartbreak Hotel'' and `` Wipeout.'' Unknown to owner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Minardi </PERSON>, the BMI logger made a playlist that became the basis for a federal court lawsuit. <PERSON> Minardi </PERSON> settled out of court for $ 12,000 in damages and attorneys' fees even though he only leased the machine from a man who kept half the profits. `` I did n't have any idea that a license was supposed to be on it,'' <PERSON> Minardi </PERSON> says. `` He made no mention that there had to be a license on it.'' <PERSON> Minardi </PERSON> now has a current license for a new machine he purchased himself. A fully authorized version of `` She Drives Me Crazy'' by Fine Young Cannibals was playing. `` When I bought my own jukebox, they sent me information saying this machine had to be registered with BMI and all that,'' he says. `` That was the first I'd heard of it.'' The suit was based on songs played before <PERSON> Minardi </PERSON> obtained his license. He says he forwarded cease-and-desist requests to the owner of the jukebox, who has since died. BMI files up to 200 suits a year against bars, restaurants and nightclubs, generally seeking between $ 500 and $ 1,000 for each song title heard. Four years ago, <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocasek </PERSON> from The Cars, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> took matters into their own hands, filing suit together to stop a southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> bar from playing their music illegally. `` We try to call and write and see them,'' <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> says. `` The suit is only the last resort. We're not in the business of filing suit. We're in the business of licensing music.'' Like <PERSON> Minardi </PERSON>, most violators succumb quietly, agreeing to pay BMI a few thousand dollars for past violations and agreeing to purchase the $ 63 jukebox license. <PERSON> Kropelak </PERSON> says he has often had trouble in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and his boss, BMI general licensing vice president <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Annastas </PERSON>, says it's because many people resent being asked to pay for what they already consider theirs `` We've had our field representatives roughed up. Whenever you go in some place and tell someone they have to pay for something they do n't feel they should have to pay for, they resent that,'' <PERSON> Annastas </PERSON> says. `` They've bought the disc jockey, they've bought the record or bought the tape, and you go in there and tell them they have to pay something else.'' For that reason, BMI loggers ask to remain anonymous for fear bar owners will retaliate. `` If they would just take care of business, I would n't have to worry about it,'' says the logger who busted <PERSON> Joey </PERSON>'s. `` It should never reach that point.'' The <PERSON> Joey </PERSON>'s logger was a local musician who was upset that some people would use music for free. BMI officials say they look for other musicians to make the job as easy as possible. `` The first criteria is their knowledge of music and their ability to recognize music, whether it be in a drugstore, a nightclub or a skating rink,'' <ORGANIZATION> Siebel </ORGANIZATION> says. `` It's one thing tohe issue. The issue is, is industry willing to invest to make it a good neighbor?'' <PERSON> Lusk </PERSON> cited <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aluminum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as a business that has done just that by installing new equipment to reduce emissions that were blamed for killing trees and slowing tree growth in the area. But others believe a balance of development can not _ or should not _ be struck. `` This area is not appropriate for many reasons _ for aesthetics, for wildlife, for destroying the qualities of why people want to come here or live here,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assocation </ORGANIZATION>, which filed legal challenges to both <ORGANIZATION> Cenex </ORGANIZATION> wells proposed in the area. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Polebridge </LOCATION>, a tiny community five miles north of the well site. The preservation group he heads also has opposed the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> coal mine, some subdivision efforts and proposals to pave the dirt road that leads to <LOCATION> Polebridge </LOCATION>. `` People do n't come up here to see oil wells,'' <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> said. Another environmental group has targeted development in an area just southeast of the park, where two companies have proposed drilling test wells for oil and gas. The proposals by <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrofina </ORGANIZATION> have been delayed, however, while the <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> prepares an environmental impact statement. The wells are proposed in the Badger-Two Medicine region, a 110,000-acre roadless area located just south of the park and near two wilderness areas. The <ORGANIZATION> Badger-Two </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, seeking wilderness designation for the area, has fought the drilling proposals. Alliance president <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> feels development would damage the area severely. But oil and gas industry officials maintain that development can occur with little effect on the environment. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Cenex </ORGANIZATION> planned a number of precautions at its well site, including measures to keep wildlife away from the site and to protect the quality of surface water. Drilling also would be limited to certain times of the year, to avoid periods of eagle nesting and animal migration. `` Historically, there are producing wells on college campuses, downtown business districts, in back yards,'' he says. `` They can be made almost totally compatible with almost any environment.''

 The poles of pro-life and pro-choice in the abortion debate seem ever farther apart. Here is a group of women who have based a women's help center on the biblical quotation from <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON>: `` <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because her children are no more.''

 In the aftermath of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s defeat of efforts to tighten abortion regulations, the battle continues In this city, for instance, there is a volunteer group called the Sisters of <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> that seeks to help women out of the trauma of abortion. And there are experts who deny abortion produces long-term emotional pain. The Sisters of <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> have a counseling center where they teach women to cry, to blame and to forgive, especially themselves. `` There's so many women out there hurting like we were,'' says <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a co-founder of the Sisters. `` This is a place they can come and let all that grief come out.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> says she did n't begin to deal emotionally with her abortion until nearly 10 years later. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivenbark </PERSON>, who operates the <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, does n't think women suffer guilt pains after abortion. `` I have worked in abortion for many, many years,'' <PERSON> Rivenbark </PERSON> says. `` Most women have come to terms with their decision by the time it's made. I do not believe in this post-abortion syndrome. Afterward I do n't see a lot of depression, tears or guilt. I see a lot of relief.'' The health center performs abortions twice a week in <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> where there were 5,577 abortions last year. There were 62,539 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> of the Sisters of <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> says she had to overcome the guilt of her own abortions. `` It catches up sooner or later.'' `` I would n't let anybody get close to me,'' says <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>, 28. `` I did n't tell anybody about my pregnancies. I began to feel it was my closet secret. I was a bitter person, not once, but twice.'' She had abortions when she was 17 and 21. It was n't until four years after her second abortion that she first saw pictures of fetal development. `` A baby at 11-12 weeks was fully formed with everything functioning. A heartbeat. A nervous system. I freaked out. It was the first time I really sobbed over what I had done.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> founded the Sisters of <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> four years ago and since have counseled more than 170 women. It has no relationship to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rachel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which also counsels women and tries to persuade them to carry their pregnancies to term. The reasons women decide to abort are as varied as the women, says <PERSON> Rivenbark </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Womens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` They come here for financial reasons, too many children, alcohol or drugs, spousal abuse, illness, fetal abnormalities and lack of education about birth control.'' Ninety percent of the abortions are performed in the first trimester, <PERSON> Rivenbark </PERSON> says. `` At eight weeks there's nothing there; it looks like a cloud,'' she says. In January the founders of the Sisters of <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> also started the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pregnancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where they offer free pregnancy tests and information on alternatives to abortion clinics. `` In this program we want to tell women what it is all about; give them the facts, the options, and let them make an informed decision,'' says the 35-year-old <PERSON> Layton </PERSON>. `` We try to sway them not to abort,'' says <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, 29. For seven months they went to seminars, read, took counseling courses, drew on their own experiences, then devised a format. What developed was a post-abortion syndrome support group that meets once a week for six to eight weeks. Today, they get referrals from psychologists, the women's center, a hot line, area universities and others who have been through the program.

 The first night, in small groups of five or six, the women sit around and talk about their abortions. `` A lot of them come in terrified because they've never told anyone. Some come because they ca n't handle the pressure anymore. We're their last resort,'' says <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>. `` Usually, it's a night of crying,'' adds <PERSON> Layton </PERSON>. `` They admit their secret.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> was probably past three months in her pregnancy when she had an abortion at age 17. `` My self-worth was zero,'' she says. `` There were six of us in a group at the clinic. I remember thinking we were like cows. `` Everyone was crying. I sobbed uncontrollably when they asked me afterward how I felt. I said, ` I think I just killed my baby.' But I was so relieved it was over, that I was n't pregnant anymore. I went on with life. `` I became real promiscuous, married six months later, had a child right away to make up for it. Then I divorced, went back to promiscuity and got into alcohol and drugs.'' She went on for four years before deciding as a single parent she had to do something else. She got a real estate license and sold houses figuring it would make her happy and rich and put her around people who did n't do drugs. `` This was n't it either,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. Then she met her husband. `` He was a Christian. I told him about the abortion and he accepted me.'' When she was three months pregnant with their child she had a sonogram. `` I could n't believe it. I had never looked at fetal development. This was the same point at which I had had my abortion. It was a good negative. It was clear. This was a baby.'' Even after she delivered her second child, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said the abortion still troubled her. She talked to a woman at church. `` I unleashed everything that had happened. Over the past 10 years I had been running from this bad person,'' says <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, now a mother of three. The first night at the center is informal and flexible. `` We're just there to lead them through it. Sometimes when the hurt is so deep it takes longer,'' says <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>. `` It takes a lot out of you to deal with people in such a state. Some are suicidal. We've had some who had abortions three weeks earlier and their bodies have n't even healed yet. Once we had a woman who had a back-alley abortion 30 years ago and was still carrying around the guilt.'' Finally, there is a night for grieving and making peace. If problems remain, the women are referred to outside counseling. Out of the Sisters of <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> grew the crisis pregnancy program where they have counseled 70 women this year. Three women who visited, thinking of having abortions, changed their minds. `` Even if one ends positively, it's worth it,'' says <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. `` If they want to look into adoptions, we hook them up with an attorney. If they want to keep the baby but ca n't afford it, we help them find help,'' says <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>. While abortions at the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> health clinic run between $ 280 and $ 850, they can run up to $ 1,500 for more advanced pregnancies, <PERSON> Rivenbark </PERSON> says. The <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> center does abortions up to 17.9 weeks of pregnancy. After that, women are referred to the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> center for two-day procedures. <PERSON> Rivenbark </PERSON> says doctors wo n't accept women further along than 20.5 weeks. A woman is asked if she has considered options and told of the surgical risk _ from infection to an emergency surgery. `` If a girl is unsure, or does n't want the abortion and is being pushed by a boyfriend or parents, we give referrals,'' <PERSON> Rivenbark </PERSON> says. Outside her clinic, a lone picket parades silently on the sidewalk wearing a four-foot sign. It reads: `` Lord Jesus Forgive Our Nation.''

 In the early decades of the century, it was the gathering place of artists and writers, bon vivants and aspiring models, American expatriates and Russian political exiles. <LOCATION> Montparnasse </LOCATION>, on the left bank of the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, was a neighborhood of remarkable creativity and unflagging revelry. Today it is the site a cult art form in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. But it is <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' lone skyscraper, the sleek <ORGANIZATION> Montparnasse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, that is perhaps the clearest symbol of a new age. `` Now, there are just one or two painters. It's not like before,'' says <PERSON> Aime </PERSON> <PERSON> Duhauvel </PERSON>, a house painter who for 51 years lived at 8 <ORGANIZATION> Rue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chaumiere </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Modigliani </PERSON> had his atelier. <PERSON> Duhauvel </PERSON>, forced out of his apartment by high prices in 1984, returns daily to chat with his friend, the local shoemaker. Ms. <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>, who has lived on the Isle of Wight since 1935, says she `` ran away'' to escape what was becoming the incestuous smallness of the quarter. The gentrification of <LOCATION> Montparnasse </LOCATION> was inevitable, says <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluver </PERSON>. `` The artists create the community and the real estate people move in.'' For <PERSON> Kluver </PERSON>, who spent 10 years gathering documentation for his book, the spirit of <LOCATION> Montparnasse </LOCATION> is dead. Not everyone agrees. `` This neighborhood inspires me,'' says <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouradian </PERSON>, a clothes designer who lives two doors from <LOCATION> Hemingway </LOCATION>'s former <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> abode. `` Each building here possesses a soul.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kowalezyk </PERSON> says her clients at <LOCATION> Wadja </LOCATION> are the same as before, just younger. `` For us, things have n't changed,'' she says. `` It's difficult with our prices, but people still need to eat. `` To make a long story short,'' <PERSON> Kluver </PERSON> quotes <PERSON> Kiki </PERSON>'s memoirs, `` <LOCATION> Montparnasse </LOCATION> is a village that's as round as a circus. You get into it and you do n't know just how, but getting out again is not so easy!'' <PERSON> Kiki </PERSON> simply `` burned herself out,'' says <PERSON> Kluver </PERSON>, collapsing and dying at age 52, not far from the boulevard.

 Before taking the role as a teen-age doctor on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON>, M.D.,'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> talked to some real physicians. They laughed at the premise but still gave him advice. `` I did n't find any teen-age doctors when I did some research,'' he says. `` Most prodigies are in the arts. But it's possible that a young person could become a doctor. There are no age limits.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> sees <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON> as a normal kid who just happens to be a doctor. `` The role's purposely written to have all the qualities any kid would have,'' he says. <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> is a prodigy who graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> at the age of 10, from medical school at 14, and now, at 16, is a hospital resident. He can perform surgery, but he's just old enough to get a driver's license. `` The contrast is between him being a normal kid and being a doctor,'' says <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` Most of the humor comes from his age. Women say they do n't want a 16-year-old kid examining them. In the pilot, an adult attorney whined when I sewed up his rear and threatened to sue me. But <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> with his intellect and savvy gets out of it. `` <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON>'s an only child and his parents try to treat him as much like a normal teen-ager as possible. They realize he's a genius and a doctor and that makes it more complicated. He told his mother the facts of life when he was 3 years old.'' `` <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON>, M.D.'' is the first show from <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> in his multi-series deal with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>, whose past co-creations were `` Hill Street Blues'' and `` <ORGANIZATION> L.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>,'' wrote the comedy with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>. The show has been successful in the ratings, although not a major hit. The series also stars <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikking </PERSON> and <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> as <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressman </PERSON> as the hospital chief of services and <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Casella </PERSON> as his teen-age buddy. Taking time away from the set, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is interviewed in the building 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> has built for <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>, sitting on a bench in an open, atrium-like area. Like his character, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is 16 and attempts to lead a normal life while showing his own genius for acting. Before beginning the series, he lived in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, and attended school there between movies. His parents, who are both attorneys, have moved temporarily to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Most recently, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> starred with <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Widmark </PERSON> in `` Cold Sassy Tree,'' a turn-of-the-century drama on <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. Last season he was in the Hall of Fame production `` Home Fires Burning'' and `` Leave Her To Heaven.'' He was in the feature film `` Clara's Heart'' with <PERSON> Whoopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>. He's also had several guest roles in series, including a role as a child evangelist who was beginning to stray toward evil on `` B.L. <PERSON> Stryker </PERSON>,'' with <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> auditioned for the role of <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON> about the time he was doing `` Home Fires Burning.'' `` There were four of us up for the role,'' he says. `` They narrowed it down to three before it worked out that I got it. I talked to <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> before he wrote the script. `` I thought it was a great concept. It's neat to have a series based on a child. With ` The Wonder Years,' adults can look back and say, ` Yes, I remember when that happened to me.' Here, we're in the present and people can say, ` Yes, I remember my first kiss.' But it suddenly changes. He's a doctor. Still, there are things you can relate to. `` The show's a mixture of comedy and serious subjects. Lots of times <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> wants to lash out at adults who treat him as a child when he's smarter than they are.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is a junior in high school this year and hopes to go on to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, but not to study medicine, which he says is too hard and takes too many hours. `` I want to make the transition to adult actor,'' he says. `` That's a real barrier. I do n't want to be typecast as a certain character. I think some child actors get typecast with their hair slicked back or as a nerd or like the Fonz.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> began acting at the age of 6 when he accompanied his brother <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> to a school audition for `` The Wizard of Oz.'' He played Toto. `` I was doing magic even before that,'' he says. `` Sleight of hand, illusions, producing things out of nowhere, you name it. I want to take magic as far as I can. It's a great hobby. I do n't think I'll do it professionally There are no schools. The best way to get into magic is to study with someone as an apprentice.'' But do n't be surprised if <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> puts on a magic show for sick kids at the hospital.

 It requires a special talent to take an obscure wedding dance by <PERSON> Edvard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grieg </PERSON> and turn it into a Hit Parade smash like `` Strange Music'' or transform the exotic themes of <PERSON> Borodin </PERSON> into songs like `` Stranger in Paradise'' and `` Baubles, Bangles and Beads.'' For much of their careers, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> have used that talent, adapting someone else's music, usually a classical composer, and spinning it into something new. They did it in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, working on dozens of films like `` Maytime,'' `` Sweethearts'' and `` I Married an Angel,'' and on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> with shows like `` Song of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>,'' `` Magdalena'' and `` Kismet.'' `` Writing original music is 10 or 20 times easier than the things for which we are best known,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was saying the other day. `` The first thing you have to do as an adapter is learn everything a composer ever wrote. Then you have to assemble and assimilate the music. And finally, think the way he did.'' At 75, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is the talkative member of the songwriting team. <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON>, one year younger, nods in agreement. Their partnership has lasted some 60 years. It began at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> where they wrote their first song _ `` Hail to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> High!'' _ and has continued into the present. Their latest musical, `` Grand Hotel,'' currently is on view at the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> Theater. `` Grand Hotel,'' directed and choreographed by <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tune </PERSON>, focuses on the guests at a large luxury hotel in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. It's based on the 1920s best-selling <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> novel that later became a successful movie starring <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON>. The musical, using an original <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> score, takes place in 1928, a year its composer and lyricist remember very well. `` We were both working musicians by that time,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says. `` I had won an amateur contest playing the Rachmaninoff ` C Sharp Minor Prelude' when I was 9 and went into vaudeville. I found out very young that there was money in music, so I never touched the piano unless I was paid. `` I played for <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>, all in the same year. I think it was 1933.'' Two years later, at ages 21 and 20, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and found work at <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the studio associated with the classiest of the movie musicals. They were signed to write original music and lyrics. But the team found little work until a disaster nearly derailed a film version of <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Romberg </PERSON>'s `` Maytime,'' starring <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Thalberg </PERSON>, the legendary producer, died with only half the film musical completed. A new director started over, and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> were assigned to come up with new musical material. Much of it was taken from music already in the public domain, pieces like <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s `` Fifth Symphony'' and pieces of operas. The movie was a big success, and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> stayed in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> for seven years, participating in some 50 movies, often anonymously. `` We worked on anything they asked,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says. `` You're slaves in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, very happy slaves, but they owned us body and soul We always did our very best and worked as artistically as we possibly could.'' Finally, they quit. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stothart </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>'s famous musical director and their mentor, told them: `` They'll keep you forever. People will never know who you are.'' Before they left they wrote a small musical revue called `` Thank You, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>,'' that opened _ and closed _ in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. But through it, they met producer <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> who vowed to put on their next show. `` Once you write anything for the stage and you put it in front of an audience and you hear them react, then the movies become very dreary and dull,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says. The team traveled to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to write for cabaret, nightclubs and radio. The work included special club material for performers like <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Durante </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Froman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> reappeared in their lives in 1944, with an idea for a stage musical based on the life of <PERSON> Edvard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grieg </PERSON>, using the composer's own melodies. The idea became `` Song of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>.'' It was a big success for <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and he brought it to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where it ran for over two years. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> also was responsible for `` Kismet,'' the team's other big <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hit. This musical, a sort of Broadway meets the Arabian Nights, won them a Tony Award in 1954. Besides `` Stranger in Paradise'' and `` Baubles, Bangles and Beads,'' the songs included `` This Is My Beloved'' and `` Rhymes Have I.'' The musical version of `` Grand Hotel'' has had a 20-year history. It began in 1958 with <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> who adapted the book for the great Yiddish comedian <PERSON> Menasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Skulnik </PERSON>. It was called `` At the Grand.'' But by th time the musical went into production, it starred <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Muni </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Diener </PERSON>. Muni got sick, and the musical never got beyond tryouts in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Two years ago, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> resurrected the idea and took it to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON>. He told them, `` I would like to start all over again and really do <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>'s novel,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> recalls. `` Our other version was set in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and was about movies and opera. We went back to the original.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> began reworking their score, and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> extensively revised the book. `` The most important part of a musical is the book, not the music and lyrics,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says. `` Once the book tells a story that is interesting, then the music and lyrics have something to say. Up until then, they are just songs.'' `` The book is more important because most of the critics are literary critics; they are not music critics,'' <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> adds. `` What they criticize is the book.'' At ages when most people have been retired for a decade, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> keep writing. They are revising `` The Anastasia Game,'' a new version of their 1965 musical `` Anya,'' which recently had a production in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and working on `` Uncle <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>,'' a musical based on the <PERSON> Eudora </PERSON> <PERSON> Welty </PERSON> novella `` The Ponder Heart.'' `` You ca n't stop working,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says. `` Besides, most of our working consists of sitting and thinking,'' <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> adds. `` You sit and you wish.''

 Nearly four years ago, <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> stood before television cameras and proclaimed that a `` dark night of tyranny'' had come to an end in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, had been driven into exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> by the `` people power revolution'' that brought Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. The `` night of tyranny'' she referred to in taking her oath as president on Feb. 25, 1986, may have ended, but poverty, insurgency, crime and social inequities remain. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> arrives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday, after visiting <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, in search of more trade and investment in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to cope with those problems at home. From Vancouver, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, she is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, before heading home via either <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. She'll confer with businessmen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. But the struggle to deal with economic problems, armed insurgencies and coup attempts has sapped the euphoria and political vitality that in 1986 drove <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he died Sept. 22 at the age of 72, and vaulted Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the office that many thought should have been her husband's. It was the assassination of the husband, Sen. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, on Aug. 21, 1983, that set off the chain of events that led to the `` people power revolution'' in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who had been imprisoned by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for seven years before being allowed to leave for exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was returning home that August day to challenge <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>; he was shot to death as he stepped off a plane at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s airport. But today in <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, a feeling persists that nothing has changed since the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> years. Recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION> polling service said only 35 percent of 300 Manilans surveyed were satisfied with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, down from a high of 77 percent two years ago. `` There is a growing number of people who are dissatisfied with her,'' said Rev. <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernas </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Ateneo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and an Aquino supporter. `` Satisfaction is going down steadily. Halfway in her fourth year she has not rebounded.'' Inflation today is 12 percent. Allegations of corruption abound. Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic archbishop and the nation's leading churchman, often comments that Filipinos rid themselves of `` <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Baba </PERSON>, but the 40 thieves remain.'' By <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Baba </PERSON> he means <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` Because of poverty and lack of education, people end up being victims of injustice,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Villafuerte </PERSON>, chairman of the Governors League of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` If you can not improve that situation, you can say you have a democracy, you have elections, you have a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but it means nothing to people who are poor and suffering.'' Human rights abuses continue, as do killings by Communist insurgents. The killings include the assassination in April of Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the slayings of two other Americans in September. Ordinary Filipinos are threatened by rising crime, much of it committed by police and soldiers, including car thefts, murders and bank robberies. Police say the crime rate has increased by 6.5 percent since Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took office. For the first six months of this year, the monthly crime index stood at 20.17 incidents per 100,000 people. More than 15 percent of the nation's 72,730 recorded crimes occurred in greater <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The Social Weather Stations survey said 25 percent of the 300 <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> residents polled reported they had been victims of crime. But no groundswell of opposition appears to be building against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, known affectionately as <PERSON> Cory </PERSON>. Attempts by the left and right to organize huge street demonstrations have largely fizzled. Filipinos appear more concerned with the struggle for a decent living. But there is a feeling Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> might be missing a historic opportunity to transform the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> into a model of progressive <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> democracy. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> can point to significant accomplishments. She has restored democratic institutions, unshackled the press and held back Communist and Moslem insurgents. The economy has grown steadily and is expected to increase by about 6 percent this year. But economic gains have mostly benefitted upper middle class entrepreneurs with little filtering down to the masses. Government figures indicate the lowest third of society controls only 9 percent of the national income, virtually the same as under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Millions subsist on incomes barely adequate for food and lodging.

 Among those millions is <PERSON> Aurora </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, who supports an unemployed husband and two children on a monthly salary of 1,543 pesos -LRB- $ 73.50 -RRB- as a clerk in the Education Department. Her expenses average about 2,925 pesos -LRB- $ 139.30 -RRB- a month, she said. She makes up the difference by borrowing money from colleagues. Others like her supplement their salaries by selling home-grown foods or other items to fellow office workers. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, wealthy Filipinos live in spacious homes in plush, well-guarded `` villages.'' But government figures indicate that Filipinos in 25 of the 73 provinces receive few state services. In <LOCATION> Sulu </LOCATION>, a largely Moslem province 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, 133 of every 1,000 infants die before their first birthday. Life expectancy for males in <LOCATION> Basilan </LOCATION> province is 52.9 years _ 10 years years below the national average. `` There is always the expectation of better things,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` And there have been better things. But I suppose what people would like is for all these good things to happen yesterday.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who is American-educated and a member of a wealthy family, did not set out to recast Philippine society but to restore the institutions that the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> years had destroyed or corrupted. Hers was to be an `` institutional revolution,'' the success or failure of which would show whether U.S.-style democracy can work in a poor country. But those values were imposed on an Asian society in which family ties, paternalism and respect for authority sometimes lead to nepotism, corruption and entrenched `` warlord'' families. Longtime colonial domination _ first by Spaniards, then by Americans _ established a tradition of armed struggle such as the 20-year-old Communist insurgency and the Moslem revolt that flares and subsides. Colonialism also produced a class of landed elite, which prospered through war, revolution, dictatorship and democracy. Many of the old families _ the Laurels, the <ORGANIZATION> Lopezes </ORGANIZATION>, the Cojuangcos, the <ORGANIZATION> Aquinos </ORGANIZATION> _ were at the forefront of the anti-Marcos campaign. Early in her administration, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> tried to pursue reformist goals. Her fledgling steps faltered with the rise of military influence and the re-emergence of powerful political clans. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> freed 300 political prisoners and offered peace talks to Communist and Moslem rebels. Her first human rights commissioner, the late <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Diokno </PERSON>, promised to prosecute soldiers for human rights abuses committed under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. The peace talks with the rebels failed. But the overtures and the threat of prosecution alarmed the military, setting the stage for the six coup attempts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The coups failed because of the loyalty of Gen. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, the chief of staff and now the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary. But military influence increased, and most liberals were dropped from Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s Cabinet. Talk of human rights trials and reconciliation with rebels ended. Early in her administration, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> fired all officials elected under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and appointed `` officers-in-charge.'' That led to turmoil in local administrations and a rift in the ruling coalition after factions claimed they were shortchanged in appointments. To end the turmoil, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s allies struck agreements with many former <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters in the May 1987 congressional elections and the regional balloting in January 1988. That enabled representatives of more than 30 `` warlord'' families to regain power. The influence of traditional politicians in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> slowed reform. Land reform languished in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> nearly a year before emerging with so many pro-landlord loopholes that the agrarian reform secretary, <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Defensor </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON>, fears it will be unworkable.

 THE LAND _ The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is a tropical archipelago of 7,100 islands about 500 miles east of the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> mainland, but its actual land area is about the size of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Only 7 percent of the islands are larger than one square mile and two-thirds are unnamed. The largest islands are <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> in the south.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE PEOPLE _ The 60 million Filipinos are mostly of Malay ethnic stock with mixtures of Chinese, Spanish, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, American and other European ancestry. They are descendants of Malays who began arriving in the islands about 2,000 years ago from what are now <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. About 85 percent are <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. The rest include Protestants, Moslems and adherents of tribal religions. English and Filipino, a Malay language based on <LOCATION> Tagalog </LOCATION>, are the official languages. But more than 80 other languages and dialects also are spoken.

 THE GOVERNMENT _ <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took office as president on Feb. 25, 1986, after a popular uprising toppled <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and forced him into exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> restored the U.S.-style bicameral legislature, which <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had abolished. Elections for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and House of Representatives were held in May 1987 and balloting for regional officials took place the following January.

 THE HISTORY _ <ORGANIZATION> Negritos </ORGANIZATION> migrated from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> over a land bridge thousands of years ago. When the Portugese explorer <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Magellan </PERSON> reached the islands in 1521, he found descendants of Malay people who began arriving about 2,000 years ago. A Spanish expedition returned 21 years later and named the islands for King <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The Spanish ruled until the Americans seized the islands in 1898 in the Spanish-American War. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in 1941, defeating a joint U.S.-Filipino force. Gen. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> returned with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion force in October 1944 and recaptured <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in February 1945. Full independence from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was granted on July 4, 1946. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> declared martial law in 1972 and lifted it Jan. 17, 1981.

 After winning a battle to ban ivory, conservationists now face all-out war: rescuing a vast range of animal and plant species far less imposing than the elephant. At stake are fast-rising wildlife exports worth more than $ 130 billion a year on the world's retail markets, according to specialists. Two-thirds of the trade is legal, defended by well-organized associations and by governments. The rest is contraband, via networks of poachers and smugglers often involved in drugs or arms as well. While sympathy can be whipped up over rhinos and leopards, less noble life forms suffer unnoticed, environmentalists say. At a recent <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> meeting in which elephants dominated discussions, lonely lobbyists pleaded for a delicate flower, the Turkish snowdrop, which is exported by the millions with unknown implications. Scientists warn that unless they can assemble more data and muster public opinion, valuable species will plummet toward extinction during the coming decade. `` We have very little idea of the size of many populations,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Western </PERSON>, a Kenyan biologist who is the director of research for <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It is a critical problem.'' When <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>'s caimans came up at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting, <LOCATION> Guyanese </LOCATION> authorities had to admit they had no idea how many of the scarce crocodilians still lived along their rivers. The beautiful brilliant green Manus tree snail, prized among mollusk fans, is earning badly needed revenue for <LOCATION> Papua-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, but no one knows how many can be safely sold. `` Most countries just do n't have the resources to find out what they have,'' said Western. The 103-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which adopted the ivory ban, regulates trade, but its small staff relies on outside data and enforcement. If experts can not agree that a species belongs on the `` endangered'' list, it is regarded as `` threatened'' and may be traded under license. `` When a species is listed as threatened, prices soar,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Note </PERSON> of Monitor Consortium, a Washington-based network of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and international environmental groups. `` Everything that starts on the threatened list ends up endangered,'' he said. `` Vested interests push trade for all it's worth This is big money, and we are finding the same mafias that handle drugs also dealing in wildlife.'' Until enough scientific evidence is gathered, species are not on either list, and trade is determined mainly by the open market. About 350 million tropical fish were sold last year, causing unknown depletions. In 14 years, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> alone imported 1 billion frog legs from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` We desperately need more data,'' said <PERSON> Ginette </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> head of Traffic, a monitoring agency supported by the World Wildlife Fund. `` We have to raise major money. The onus is on us.'' She noted burgeoning demands for wildlife products in newly affluent nations. `` It's booming in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and consumption is increasing everywhere,'' she said. `` The trend is just beginning.'' One Asian nation, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, has been branded by wildlife groups as one of the world's worst exploiters of wildlife. Unless ways can be found to bring exports into line with species populations, conservationists will have to push for a total ban on trade within five years, Ms. <PERSON> Hemley </PERSON> said. Traffic focuses on 30 species, mostly reptiles and birds, which are particularly endangered. Smugglers are increasingly cunning, with substantial resources for bribery and subterfuge. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents found $ 3.5 million worth of narcotics last year during searches. That included heroin in condoms stuffed into banned snakes and cocaine stashed in polar bear hides. The International Union for the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> and specialist teams keep tabs on wildlife, but arguments can be heated when export earnings are at risk. Counting small fish in big ponds, or rare birds in remote forests, involves substantial guesswork. In some countries, local authorities accept bribes to skew data, wildlife experts say. Even with the obtrusive African elephant, tracked from the air and on the ground by experienced scientists, wide discord persists over census estimates. The accepted figure is 625,000, the findings of a recent extensive survey. <PERSON> Iain </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas-Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, an experienced counter who took part in the survey, prefers 609,000. Some specialists in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, who fought hard against an ivory ban to allow culling from their controlled herds, put the number near a million. But <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeffer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, who has surveyed Central African forests, puts the total at 400,000. He says East African experts overestimate forest herds. Conservationists acknowledge the ivory victory was easier because the elephant falls into what they call the spotted-cat category. Most vulnerable species are in the rhino category. Ivory, like spotted cat fur, is valued for its visibility and can be driven out of fashion with negative publicity. <PERSON> Rhino </PERSON> horn, however, is valuable when ground up into unrecognizable powder. Only experts recognize many rare birds, reptiles and fish, and consumers continue to buy them. Primates sold for research are not vulnerable to fashion trends. Scientists say curbing harmful trade is especially important now because wildlife is under serious threat from habitat destruction in most of parts of the world. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, along with the U.N. Environment Program and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, launched a major campaign to preserve biodiversity, the vital interplay of species in nature. One-fourth of the world's plants and animals face extinction within 25 to 50 years if losses continue at the present rate, the institute said. `` The impact of such losses on human well-being is potentially devastating,'' said the institute's president, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustave </PERSON> <PERSON> Speth </PERSON>. `` No longer is it acceptable to merely slow the rate of destruction.'' But conservationists contend international mechanisms are far too lax to control trade. In one recent case, British police arrested a notorious smuggler known as the `` Raider of the Orchid.'' He served six weeks in jail and paid a fine of $ 4,200. New Scientist magazine said of the case: `` Dealers in rare plants must be laughing all the way back to the jungle ... and the cause of conservation has been set back decades.'' At the recent endangered species meeting, environmentalist groups accused Secretary-General <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapointe </PERSON> of conflict of interest for financing CITES' ivory unit with contributions from ivory traders. Earlier, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Note </PERSON> testified in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that CITES was failing in its mission because of `` underfunding, inadequate staffing and poor management.'' <PERSON> Lapointe </PERSON> denied any wrongdoing but agreed CITES was hamstrung by scant resources and faulty data from some member governments. Infraction reports catalog widespread flouting of international guidelines. Opening the CITES session Oct. 9, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, a founder of the World Wildlife Fund, criticized global efforts to control trade. He won applause by declaring: `` If there is any doubt ... on any issue ... you must give the benefit of the doubt to the survival of the species. Do n't forget, once a species has gone, it has gone forever.''

 Wildlife groups say <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is decimating its own once teeming species and those of other nations through bear-feast tours for <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>, caiman skin smuggling and the `` Polish Connection.'' The Swiss-based World Wildlife Fund for Nature and other environmental groups cite numerous examples of wanton destruction: _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> fly to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> on organized tours to feast on bear meat, which they believe enhances vigor and strength, according to <PERSON> Phisit </PERSON> <PERSON> na </PERSON> <PERSON> Phattlung </PERSON>, the Wildlife Fund's head in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> was the major link in an operation to illegally smuggle about 120,000 skins of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> caiman alligators to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last year _ The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> charges that Thai traders fake permits to send white-handed gibbons and other protected species to zoos in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> Lacking funds, the Poles obtain the animals on credit, keep about a third of them and sell the rest to Western zoos. The Wildlife Fund has recently singled out <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and three other nations _ <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> _ as blatant violators of the Convention on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endangered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Species </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fauna </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Flora </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is a party to the 1975 convention, which seeks to halt an illegal worldwide trade valued at some $ 5 billion each year. Frequently cited as reasons for <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s poor conservation record are its wildly capitalist economy, widespread corruption, poverty in rural areas and inadequate wildlife legislation. A yawning legal loophole allows the export of even endangered animals from other than domestic sources, <PERSON> Phisit </PERSON> notes. Thus Thai traders obtain wild animals from nearby <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> or produce fake documents to show that animals captured in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> came from these countries. This loophole facilitates smuggling connections from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Once a tropical wonderland, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has ravaged its own forests and their once richly varied inhabitants. `` Everything is for sale,'' said <PERSON> Phisit </PERSON>, who has monitored wildlife exploitation for two decades. Elephants, tigers, wild cattle and deer are poached in national parks. Rare wild orchids are plucked for unregulated export. Cobras are slaughtered by the thousands for their skins, meat and the purported medicinal power of their gall bladders. Eagles, hawks and other birds of prey are sold to visiting Arab falconers. Stress, poor food and lack of knowledge about animal care take their toll during and after capture. In snaring baby gibbons and other primates, for example, the mothers are normally shot by hunters. Further loss of life occurs during overseas shipment when the animals are often drugged and smuggled in airless boxes, false bottoms of containers and empty oil drums. This year only seven of 114 slow lorises _ small, large-eyed lemurs _ survived a journey via forged export documents from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` People have been buying and selling animals for centuries,'' <PERSON> Phisit </PERSON> told a group of journalists recently. `` It's the cruelty and loss of life along the way that we are against.'' <PERSON> Phisit </PERSON> and other conservationists also assail what they call the lackluster performance of Thai authorities who in turn complain of inadequate resources and little legal power to move against the traffickers. Vendors in areas frequented by foreign tourists try to sell slow lorises sometimes drugged with paint thinner to render them submissive, or gibbons whose teeth have been chipped to prevent possible bites. A local newspaper recently interviewed a dealer who explained how some gibbons are decapitated while still alive and their heads preserved for sale as souvenirs at <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>'s Weekend Market, where wildlife is frequently on display on Saturdays and Sundays. `` There are posters at the market asking people to telephone the Wildlife Department if they see wildlife traded,'' <PERSON> Phisit </PERSON> said. `` But you can call until you drop dead because it's Sunday and nobody works in the office.''

<TEXT>
 Events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which roused the world to a frenzy of outrage in June, seem more recently to have lulled it to sleep. What was once high drama on television has dwindled to a daily grind of repression and arrests since the bold `` democracy movement'' in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> was snuffed out in blood. But what happened to the horror that swept the world in June? Where are the tens of thousands of expatriate Chinese students and sympathizers who joined in strident protest? And beyond the mild sanctions announced months ago, where are the threatened boycotts, the embargoes? On Oct. 1, only about 3,500 people joined fugitives from the Chinese democracy movement for a demonstration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to counter the regime's 40th anniversary celebration. Organizers had hoped to draw nearly 10 times that many. Other disturbances of global impact _ such as the 1979 Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> or the'76 <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> massacre in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ provoked lasting reaction from the West, either by arousing Cold War passions or prompting endless demonstrations on college campuses. Yet the world seems to do little more than frown at <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> while its hard-line Communist government zealously smothers human rights. `` All the great intentions about making <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> realize the cost of oppression have faded,'' said <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, a human rights committee in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The Western European governments, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ... none has said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has to lift martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> before we'll lift the freeze on <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans. No one has said anyone involved in the violence must resign before we resume high level contacts.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> watchers point to several reasons for the muted response: _ Foreign governments do not want to disturb <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s tentative orientation toward the West, so carefully nurtured since the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> years _ The Cold War has faded, and with it fears of communist excesses _ <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> activists suffered a sharp emotional letdown after seeing their hopes crushed so abruptly; they recognize, bleakly, the current regime is just continuing that country's age-old habit of dictatorial repression _ The number of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> and other Westerners involved with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, whether economically or politically, is still small Only since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic relations were resumed in 1979 have firm ties been established after years of alienation. But the simplest reason may be out of sight, out of mind. With dozens of arrests and at least 12 executions over the summer, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government apparently has succeeded in extinguishing the democracy movement _ or at least driving it underground. `` There's no one to carry the torch,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> scholar at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` If there was some kind of opposition in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> like the unions or the church in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, they could carry the story.'' Foreign news media, getting scant information from frightened Chinese sources, have largely dropped <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the back pages. In its place are more exciting _ and visible _ developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The Chinese government has really done a very good job of managing the story,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> expert at the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` In particular they have carefully avoided any sensational event that could be a rallying cry. There is an ambiguity about it. `` They have begun to carry out a policy of systematic limitation on intellectual freedom. That's a major story but they do it in a way that is incremental. They're nickle and diming it.'' That strategy suffered a minor setback Oct. 5 when the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the exiled leader of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, for his non-violent struggle to free his country from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s occupation. It was a glancing commentary on Tiananmen Square. But there may be deeper reasons why the emotions stirred by the deaths of hundreds, perhaps thousands of Chinese on June 3-4 now seem stilled. In some ways, the times are not ripe for outrage. The Cold War has ebbed; some say ended. With it has gone the fear of communism that aroused the right-wing `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Lobby'' of the 1950s and lingered long enough to prompt President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s grain embargo and boycott of the 1980 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Olympics. Instead, today's news is filled with smiling Soviet leaders and widening gaps in the Iron Curtain. A poll published by Business Week magazine in August found that, by a 3-to-1 margin, Americans are more concerned by the economic threat from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> than the military threat from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Economics, indeed, seems to be replacing ideology as the driving force behind <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations, blurring distinctions. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has staked his future on it. So apparently have <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders, despite the lurch back into totalitarianism. `` The burden of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> relations has to some extent fallen on businessmen, who are not exactly altruists,'' commented <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dernberger </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>. For the record, <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> opened celebrations marking the regime's 40th anniversary with a blast of Cold War rhetoric. He condemned the West's `` rotten lifestyles'' and predicted the triumph of socialism over capitalism.

 But in other forums Chinese officials have quietly mollified the West, harking back to the pre-Tiananmen Square line that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> needs many years of capitalist-type development before it can succeed at socialism. The governor of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Guixian </PERSON>, told the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sept. 27 that despite setbacks, its policy of economic reform and opening to the outside world `` shall never be altered.'' In corporate boardrooms worldwide, executives still tantalized by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1 billion consumers have been quick to respond, restaffing long-established joint ventures there. `` Virtually all representatives from foreign businesses have been back from Aug. 15 on,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, who directs <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> practices for <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, the world's largest law firm and one of the first to establish a presence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Widespread speculation of a drop in agricultural trade has proved unfounded. Helped by strong business since Tiananmen Square, commodity sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, mostly cotton and wheat, are expected to be around $ 1.5 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, more than double the previous year. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said recently he hoped to resume lending to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> soon. Seven loans totaling nearly $ 800 million were suspended after the Tiananmen Square confrontation. Most foreign companies are still quietly tabling proposals to send new capital and personnel into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But like <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, they have only economic, not moral, qualms. They are looking for more signs of stability. Even that, and the loss of more than $ 1 billion in tourism, may do little to upset relations. Analysts point out that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy was overheated anyway, and the crackdown gives <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders an opportunity to check inflation and excessive In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and most major foreign capitals, a chill has settled over relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Many Western governments did not send representatives to the carefully orchestrated anniversary celebration. Mostly, however, caution reigns. `` If the premise is that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has n't been going out of his way to make headlines, that's true,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who asked not to be identified. Earlier this fall, the president deflected a reporter's question about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with a terse `` It's not time for normalcy.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration barred high-level contacts with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials and sales of military equipment after the crackdown, then fell silent. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s No. 1 trading partner and No. 1 lender, also has kept most official contacts at a low level and has not opened negotiations on new developmental loans. Few Japanese businesses are launching new projects. `` We are also very cautious'' in dealing with already-agreed loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, `` because we do not want to give the impression that we condone now what we criticized before,'' said <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Yet, `` in the hotels in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> all you see are Japanese businessmen,'' said <PERSON> Dernberger </PERSON>, who recently visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` They've already changed and gone back to business as usual.'' For most Westerners, however, business as usual means having little to do with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and this may be another reason for the tepid response to Tiananmen Square. `` I think there's less concern for human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>. `` It might be due to the racial consciousness in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We can identify with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It might be due to a longstanding historical condition that the Chinese are not permitted such freedom by their governments. ... What was exciting was the struggle to be free.'' Those who recognize that most poignantly, perhaps, are the thousands of expatriate Chinese students who protested on college campuses in June. Today, many of them are silent as well, fearful of retaliation against family and friends in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ and of their own futures. `` In June students were furious about that kind of massacre. It was very emotional. They had to speak out,'' said <PERSON> Lian </PERSON> <PERSON> Chao </PERSON> <PERSON> Han </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> and Scholars in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` After they cooled down, they really thought that they do n't want to harm their families,'' he said `` Right now ... they do n't know what they're going to do.

 The home of a witness's mother is firebombed. An informant is shot after being accidentally exposed by the prosecution. A judge worries about jurors' safety so much he debates having them wear masks in court. Small wonder this trial is being conducted behind bullet-proof plastic 1 -LCB- inches thick. The chief actor in this real-life script is 24-year-old <PERSON> Rayful </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> who, according to prosecutors, was president and chief executive officer of `` one of the largest business enterprises in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area.'' <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> is alleged by the government to have run the largest cocaine ring in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>: $ 2 million a week, 70 pounds of cocaine a month, 30 killings along the way. The supporting cast includes <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>'s mother, several brothers, brothers-in-law and his grandmother, whose home allegedly was headquarters for the enterprise and who has become a fixture on evening news shows with remarks as flamboyant as the trademark hats she wears. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> borrowed techniques from Fortune 500 companies, according to prosecutors: He offered good pay _ $ 500 a week minimum _ expensive cars, a company attorney, help in purchasing real estate, lavish trips and clothes and jewelry. There were all-expenses paid trips to the Super Bowl and to heavyweight championship fights in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. His payroll swelled once to 150 people. He operated, the government says, the hottest drug market in the city on two narrow tree-lined blocks in northeast <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> known as `` The Strip.'' At peak hours, cars would be bumper-to-bumper waiting for young street sellers to bring plastic bags of cocaine for $ 50 apiece. The trial, which began Sept. 11, has become something of a sensation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, much like the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> case that unfolded two floors down earlier in the year and the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> trial that took place two floors above. Security was tight for those cases, but nothing like the Edmond trial. The jurors are anonymous _ even to the judge and lawyers _ and are identified only by number. Would-be spectators are held down the hall and summoned one-by-one to go through metal detectors. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> declared in a memorandum that there was a `` substantial likelihood of imminent danger to the safety of the parties, witnesses, and other persons.'' Suspecting the gang was trying to identify individual jurors, he tried to close the trial to the public, leaving only reporters, but was thwarted by an appeals court. In court, <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> and his 10 co-defendants are matched one-on-one by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals. Add to that a dozen defense lawyers, four or five for the government, the 12 jurors and three alternates, court clerks and stenographer and the court takes on the appearance of a Roman Forum. There are too many lawyers to crowd at the bench for conferences; instead, they listen through wireless headphones. The 11 are charged variously with cocaine distribution, conspiracy and racketeering. For <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>, there is an additional charge punishable by life in prison without parole _ carrying on a continuing criminal enterprise. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> also is scheduled for trial, along with three other alleged gang members, on three first-degree murder charges. And there will be a third proceeding for others charged with conspiracy, swelling the number of defendants to 24. Despite the security precautions, <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>'s court had to be emptied once because of a bomb threat. Remote-control video cameras scan the well of the court and the spectator seats. The judge often has armed escorts from home to court. The chief defense lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, wrangles constantly with the judge and the government's lead lawyer, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Soiefer </PERSON>. During a shouting match, Ms. <PERSON> Soiefer </PERSON> elbowed <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> away from the lectern. He, in turn, likened her to football player <PERSON> William </PERSON> `` the Refrigerator'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> and demanded an apology. The judge said he had not seen anything wrong with the prosecutor's conduct. The trial began with six alternate jurors; it now has only three. One was dismissed earlier this month after it became clear his identity had become known to defense attorneys, another because of family hardship and the third after she allegedly told other jurors she believed all of the defendants are innocent. There have been violent incidents. In March, prosecutors by mistake mailed a letter to the home of a key informant, detailing her cooperation and warning her life might be in danger. The witness was sharing her home with <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, a defendant in the trial. A week later, the informant, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, was shot in the leg. A month later, she was found by her mother with her mouth taped shut and suffering from an apparent drug overdose. Since then she has refused to testify, citing her rights against self-incrimination. In her grand jury testimony, she had described counting money for the organization, paying salaries to the workers and preparing drugs for street sale. She said she regularly turned over shoeboxes of money to <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>, often as much as $ 60,000 a box. The trial was three weeks old when a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the home of the mother of <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellers </PERSON>, a government witness on the stand at that time. Nobody was hurt, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said all witnesses would be offered police protection. Testimony has proved no less sensational than the theatrics surrounding the trial. Ms. Sellers testified she once watched <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>'s mother _ use a money-counting machine on thousands of dollars at the home of one of <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>'s sisters. Both mother and sister are under indictment. Drug agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornille </PERSON> was surrounded on the stand by so many stacks of cocaine seized during the arrest of one defendant that he was almost blocked from view. <PERSON> Alta </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanville </PERSON> told of visiting the apartment of defendant <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and finding so much money stacked on the floor that it did not fit into three pieces of luggage. `` I would venture to say it was about $ 3 million,'' she said. <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON>, a 20-year-old serving a prison term for dealing, testified he owned seven cars when he was 17. He became acquainted with <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> outside a convenience store when he asked about the black Mercedes-Benz that <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> was driving. Asked how he knew the car was worth $ 80,000, <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON> replied: `` I had one of my own.''

 Terra-cotta works created by artists a millennium ago are featured in a new exhibit, `` Icons: Ideals and Power in the Art of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The exhibition of 125 sculptures, watercolors, oils, etchings and banners explores the various ways in which various African societies and civilizations have viewed the icons of mother and child, male and female, the male, the rider, and the stranger. `` Unlike European religious icons that focused on Christian imagery, these five African symbols represent powerful, shared cultural ideals and values central to the lives of African peoples,'' said <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholls </PERSON>, assistant curator. `` The ideals are embodied in the images as attributes of physical beauty, power or accomplishment in the social, political, religious or economic realm.'' The exhibit includes a pair of Yoruba palace doors by the sculptor <PERSON> Areogun </PERSON> with images of a king and his wives, bicyclists, colonial clerks, soldiers and equestrians to reflect late 19th - century Yoruba life `` Icons'' opened Oct. 25 and will run through Sept. 3, 1990. Here is a list of other current shows this season at some museums and galleries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>:

<HEAD>The Artists: Upstaging at the Met</HEAD>

 In the Metropolitan Opera's new production of `` Rigoletto,'' the title role is sung by <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> and soprano <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> makes a much anticipated Met debut as <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON>'s not worried about being upstaged. `` When you have a great cast and a great conductor, we perform much better,'' he says. The Italian baritone was one of the top stars of the Met last season, acclaimed as <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> in `` The Barber of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>'' and in `` Rigoletto,'' `` Madama Butterfly'' and `` The Elixir of Love.'' He gave the Met four months which, he says with a smile, he probably wo n't do again. <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> is in demand in opera houses all over the world. He started this season singing in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. He'll be at the Met for only `` Rigoletto,'' the first seven performances of nine during November and two in February. In January he'll sing the role in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. During <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON>'s fall engagement here, he'll sing the 1,000 th performance of his career and his 100th Rigoletto Five recordings on <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> will come out this season: `` The Barber of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>,'' `` Rigoletto,'' `` <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Boccanegra </PERSON>,'' `` Aida'' and a solo record of Italian songs. `` A Masked Ball,'' the last recording conducted by <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>, was released by <PERSON> Deutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Grammaphon </PERSON> in August while <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> was singing in that opera at the <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> Festival. <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON>, interviewed in his manager's office, said his early career progressed in an unusual way. His opera debut was in 1967 in the title role of `` The Barber of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>'' in <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` After three years, I am stopping the career. I was then in the chorus at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scala </LOCATION> five years. Why I do n't know. Do n't ask me why. Because of life. Many things. Things were n't going so well. Thinking about the voice technique,'' he said. `` When I did my audition for the chorus, the chorus maestro said, ` You're sure you come to the chorus?' I said, ` I'm sure. I need the money for eating.' I never lost the habit of eating. This is a big problem. `` I started again to study. I find in Milano a teacher; he was 85 at the time. I was with this old man until he died at 90 years old. In 1973, I made another debut, in <LOCATION> Lonigo </LOCATION>, a very small city. At the same time I was in the chorus at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scala </LOCATION>. In 1975 I take another important decision, with my wife and family. I left the chorus.'' He dates his career from that time. `` I'm glad and I'm very lucky. To stop the career and try again is not so easy.'' Another good thing happened during <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON>'s stint in the chorus. `` I find my wife. She is a soloist, soprano. She listened to me sing a song, a very romantic song. She fell in love. I was already in love, to sing the song. We married in 1972.'' <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> sang his first Rigoletto with his wife, <PERSON> Adriana </PERSON>, who was six months' pregnant, in <LOCATION> Lonigo </LOCATION>. `` She also sang in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and Covent Garden. She is retired now. `` My daughter, <PERSON> Cinzia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> in English, is 16. She tries to be a soprano but it's too early to know about this.'' <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON>'s big break came in 1978, singing in `` <PERSON> Luisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'' at Covent Garden with <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Katia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricciarelli </PERSON>. `` The baritone canceled in a new, very important production conducted by <PERSON> Lorin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Katia </PERSON> said my name for replacing him. She called: ` Is it possible you can come to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>? We have tomorrow the final dress rehearsal. You can sing very well this role. What you say?' My answer was, ` Yes, I can.' It was the best thing in my life as a singer.'' He had sung in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, debuting at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scala </LOCATION> in 1977, and in small houses, once with <PERSON> Ricciarelli </PERSON>, and in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, but was n't known on the international scene. `` This was the dream of everyone starting a career.'' Getting the costume altered was n't difficult, <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> says. Performing after only one rehearsal was. Was it a success? <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> smiles. `` The day after, I received in my hotel 10 or more telegrams, from the Met, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. It is incredible; this is a miracle,'' he said. `` After my first act aria and cabaletta, all I remember is the curtain coming down. I remember I'm crying. `` Luciano, after the first act, I ca n't forget, patted my shoulder and said, ` My young boy, you did tonight in one night what we did in five years.' After that, <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> calls me ` champion' instead of <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> He still says it.'' And what does <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> call <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>? `` ` Maestro.' He is the No. 1.'' <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> made his debut in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in 1979, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the Met in 1980, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1981, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 1984. Now he's being booked into 1994. He wo n't be at the Met next season. In 1991, he'll do `` A Masked Ball'' and `` <PERSON> Luisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>.'' In 1992 he'll sing `` Rigoletto.'' <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> described the character Rigoletto. `` He does insults because they entertain the Duke,'' he said. `` It is just a job. He does n't like this job. He does it because he's a hunchback. In that time, dwarfs were entertainment for the rich. `` Three years ago, there was a big scandal in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. The director wanted Rigoletto to be a clown. He is not a clown. ... He is like a piece of wood. He does what he must do, nothing more _ in my idea. <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> was in a cage. The court was dressed like fascists. This is nothing to do with ` Rigoletto.' It's not like music of this century. The time is different. You can not do ` Rigoletto' and change everything.''

 When <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> was a child, she dreamed of following in the footsteps of such singing and dancing legends as <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>. Today, it looks as if the diminutive 26-year-old vocalist and choreographer could be well on her way. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON>'s debut album, `` Forever Your Girl,'' has sold more than 2 million copies with three No. 1 singles: `` Straight Up,'' `` Forever Your Girl'' and `` Cold Hearted.'' A fourth single, `` The Way You Love Me,'' is also burning up the charts. To top it off, she recently won three MTV awards for her music and videos, and even more recently won an Emmy for her choreography of `` The <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> Show.'' She is understandably overwhelmed. `` I feel redundant when I keep saying, ` I'm overwhelmed' or ` I'm excited,' but it's really something you ca n't explain,'' she said `` It's just an inner feeling that you have. You smile and you laugh and you think, ` I'm a real lucky girl.''' <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> has come a long way from her days cheerleading for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakers </ORGANIZATION>, considering it was an opportunity she almost missed. She heard about the audition and went with her girlfriends, but became discouraged when she saw hundreds of Laker Girl hopefuls milling about waiting for their chance to perform. `` I drove the girls that were auditioning with me so I had to wait for them. And at the very last second, after hours, I said, ` What the heck, I'm just gon na go ahead.' `` I was a big basketball fan,'' she said. `` I was a huge Laker fan and we each would get two season seats. What more could you want? The Lakers were really hot.'' Soon after being selected as one of the 12 cheerleaders in 1981, the choreographer left to get married. She asked a very young <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> to take over the job. Like everything she commits herself to, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> devoted herself to getting the Laker Girls noticed. She incorporated traditional cheerleading with jazzy dance steps and savvy street moves. The fans did notice _ and the offers started pouring in for <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> to choreograph. She helped smooth out dance steps for a music video by the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksons </ORGANIZATION> and did some commercial work. Then she choreographed the videos for <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s `` What Have You Done for Me Lately?'' and `` When I Think of You,'' among others. `` I was n't looking to become a choreographer really,'' <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> said. `` These were little jobs that came my way and it was something that was good money and it was fun.'' Besides choreographing videos for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Top </ORGANIZATION> and the Pointer sisters, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> arranged dance steps for <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kool </PERSON> and the Gang and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> concert tours. She also choreographed two films, `` The Running Man'' and `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' She became so busy she had to say goodbye to the Laker Girls. But with the looming examples of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> still was drawn to song. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> laughed as she talked recently about her break into the recording business. She said the record company executives who worked with her on music videos kept asking, `` So what do you want to do when you grow up, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON>?'' She would respond: `` I want to be an artist on your label.'' Finally two executives took her seriously and signed her to a recording deal. `` Forever Your Girl'' was the result. `` I remember thinking when I was making the album: ` Look, I'm having a good time doing this but it would be really wonderful if I really sold albums It would be wonderful if I had hit songs,''' she said. The album has since produced the three hits, and probably will generate a few more. `` You feel like, ` Well gosh, I have a No. 1 single, that's really great. Then you have another single that comes out and it goes No. 1 and you freak out,'' she said. `` I freaked out. I could n't believe it. Then you have a third one that goes No. 1 and you go, ` Oh my God! I'm dreaming!''' <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> never expected such quick success when she was a young girl taking `` hours and hours'' of dancing lessons and dreaming of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in her <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> neighborhood. Her dark good looks come from a Brazilian and Syrian father, and a French Canadian mother. She said when she was little, her mother warned her about the perils of show business and urged her to have another dream. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> seriously took the advice and went to <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Northridge </LOCATION>, where she entered the radio-TV-film program. `` I still had a strong love of song and dance and acting, but I knew in case it never worked for me then I would maybe have a career as a sports commentator.'' Unfortunately for the sports world, she never took that career track _ and now juggles choreography and singing while trying to find time for herself. After a recent early morning photo shoot, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> admitted she was pressed for time because she had to catch a plane to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` It gets draining,'' she said. `` When it gets to be a little bit too much that's when I have to back off, at least for a day, because I do n't want it ever to be tedious. I want to always feel the way I'm feeling now.'' She had been scheduled to choreograph the film version of the musical `` Evita,'' but got a reprieve of the four-month project in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> dropped out as lead. With that shelved, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> wants to take a week off, then immerse herself in a second album, which may include some surprises. `` Musically, I'm more involved now and I have different ideas of where I want to go,'' she said. `` I'm not going to deviate too much from what I've done, with what's been successful for me, but I plan on stretching a lot.'' Her success has not stifled her ambition. She eventually wants to break into acting, much like her <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> idols, and is currently considering several prospects. `` I definitely want to act,'' she said. `` But I definitely want to continue making music and I'll never give up choreography.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON> liked to write standing up, waking in the early morning and starting work at a blue lectern. By the afternoon, the author would be seated in an armchair, a wooden board across his lap. He usually wrote until bedtime. With books taking up most of his day, letters were written only for specific reasons: business, a line to his publisher or a legal matter that required his signature. There were also notes to his family: passionate letters to his wife, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, when they were apart for a time; messages slipped under the hotel room door of his son, <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Montreaux </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>; words of encouragement to his brother, <PERSON> Kirill </PERSON>, an aspiring poet. Not every writer could be creative at all times, but as <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON> said in a recent interview, even the most casual memo by his father was something special, graced by the touch that produced `` Lolita,'' `` The Gift,'' `` Ada'' and many others. `` It was a thrill, I loved it,'' recalled <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON>, 55, who helped compile `` The Letters of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON>: 1940-1977'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION>, $ 29.95 -RRB-. `` I knew, that as in his fiction, around the corner of every sentence there would be a nice little surprise, a linguistic surprise,'' he said. `` Whether he was writing to a publisher, writing to a son, making up a grocery list _ there was always something original in how he phrased it. The receptors of my spinal cord were always ready for his language.'' <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON> admits that a certain settling of accounts was in mind upon issuing his late father's letters. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabakov </PERSON>'s stern, precise image represented just one side, his son insists. Consider what the author wrote to Vera in May 1937 after his recovery from a recent illness: `` You know _ now I can tell you frankly _ the indescribable torments in February, before these treatments, drove me to the border of suicide _ a border I was not authorized to cross because I had you in my luggage. My love, is it really true that I shall soon see you _ if fate does not let me down? `` Try not to worry too much, my love. We shall be together soon anyway. Tell Mother I embrace her and am not writing her only because I am spending all my epistolary energy on you.'' `` Lolita,'' of course, touched off dozens of letters, ranging from amusement to anger as frightened publishers suggested changes or backed away, and governments attempted censorship. <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON> knew his story of a middle-aged man's passionate affair with a 12-year-old girl would create controversy and this 1950s best seller became the usually apolitical author's most passionate cause. On March 6, 1956, he wrote to <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literature </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON> also taught: `` I know that ` Lolita' is my best book so far. I calmly lean on my conviction that it is a serious work of art, and that no court could prove it to be ` lewd and libertine.' `` All categories raid, of course, into one another: a comedy of manners written by a fine poet may have its ` lewd' side; but <PERSON> Lolita </PERSON> is a tragedy. ` Pornography' is not an image plucked out of context; pornography is an attitude and an intention. The tragic and the obscene exclude each other.'' Those writers <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON> found inferior are spared nothing. Poet T.S. <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> and author <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> are dismissed as `` big fakes.'' Nobelist <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> is `` a mediocrity.'' Poet <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Pound </PERSON> is `` disgusting and entirely second-rate.'' Critic <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a onetime supporter, feuded openly with <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON>. In the 1950s, after many years of a warm friendship, these two great literary figures drifted apart. It started on a professional level, with <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON> attacking <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s attempts at Russian translation and ended with bitter, personal attacks in the early 1970s, shortly before the critic's death `` As you perhaps know, the warm friendship between EW and VN, which began in 1941, was later obliterated by minor and major clashes,'' <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON> would sadly note. He preferred the Russian poet <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Pushkin </PERSON>, spending years on the English translation of his novel in verse, `` <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Onegin </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON> also admired <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, whose `` Ulysses'' was labeled `` pornographic'' as well, and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Proust </PERSON>, author of the classic `` Remembrance of Things Past,'' whose gift for intricate detail had a powerful influence. `` Proust was very visual and chromatic in his approach and so was father,'' <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON> said. `` Father in his youth wanted to a painter. At the age of 15, he received lessons in the house. He had talent, but his teacher read the first of my father's attempts at poetry and prose and said, ` You have to a writer, or a poet.''' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON>, the son of a prominent liberal in pre-revolutionary <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, was born 1899 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> -LRB- now <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> -RRB-. He read <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turgenev </PERSON> as a child, played chess and collected butterflies, a lifelong fascination. Unhappy with the Bolshevik government, he emigrated in 1919 and lived in several countries before settling in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1940. Twenty years later, the author and <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, where they remained until his death in 1977. <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON> still lives in <LOCATION> Montreaux </LOCATION>. `` He was a wonderfully warm guy,'' said <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON>, who translated several of his father's books. `` He was my best friend, as is mother. But he was intransigent with bad art and second-hand ideas. Intransigent with those who mutilated his art. And very, very jealous with his time. `` His time and strength were finite. He felt he had a gift that he had to utilize to the fullest and he wanted to write. He did not go on bookstore tours and was very parsimonious in giving interviews.'' In 1964, <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON> did agree to a rare interview, and conducted it in even rarer style. The reporter filled a stack of paper with questions and handed them to <PERSON> Nabokov </PERSON>, who walked to his lectern and composed the answers. Always, his son observed, the author knew how he best communicated. `` In his own words, ` I think like a genius, I write like a distinguished author, I speak like a child.' He also said that he was a wretched public speaker, which was n't true. He was a wonderful speaker, he did a lot of ` off-the-Nabokov-uffing,' as he called it. `` He was such a precisionist with language. He felt that everything he published should be up to the best level or the right thought.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Award-Winning Career Started in Bathroom</HEAD>

 Some groups start as garage bands, bar bands or studio bands, but Grammy-winning Take 6 began as a bathroom band. The original group of six young students began harmonizing in a bathroom at <ORGANIZATION> Oakwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a Seventh-day Adventist school in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, nine years ago. `` You always have good acoustics in a bathroom,'' said <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the group's leader. `` It was a large bathroom and you have sounds reverberating off the wall. The sound is better as long as there is n't anyone doing anything that might upset you.'' From those bathroom rehearsals and several personnel changes came a jazz-styled, a cappella gospel group that scored a hit with its first single, `` Spread Love.'' The single and self-titled debut album earned the group three Grammy nominations and two Grammys for best soul gospel performance by a group and best jazz vocal performance by a duo or group. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kibble </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Dent </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> `` Vinnie'' <LOCATION> Chea </LOCATION> have just finished a national tour and are working on their second album in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. The first LP, which was declared gold for selling 500,000 copies, consists of traditional gospel and contemporary Christian songs such as `` Gold Mine,'' `` Mary'' and `` A Quiet Place.'' But the sound is a mixture of <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transfer </ORGANIZATION>, the Beach Boys and <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, Wind and Fire. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> regards the group's sound as a means of conveying a message as much as music. `` In the Christian world there is room for entertainment,'' he said. `` You have to wrap the message up in a package that is appealing to people. Most people wo n't come out and listen to somebody who is going to thump a Bible over their head. But I will come out and listen to some nice jazz sounds. `` Our message simply is that the love of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> will apply toward everyone.'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> acknowledges that some listeners might be turned off by the message, but he points out the album has reached gold status and is still selling well after its March 1988 release. The group tries not only to present its message during performances but is also noted for adhering to a Seventh-day Adventist lifestyle off stage. <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> says none of the members drinks alcoholic beverages or smokes and several are vegetarians. `` Being Seventh-day Adventist first off means we observe the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. It has been a little difficult ... to allow us to have that time. In the record industry, a lot of times it happens that we have to turn things down or say can we do it on Sunday morning or Saturday evening. `` People are slowly but surely coming around to realize that we are different.'' Just as Take 6's lifestyle is different, so will be the next album, <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said. While the group's a cappella sound was praised by industry figures such as producer <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>, whose answering machine played one of the group's tunes, <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said the new album probably wo n't be entirely a cappella `` Everybody plays an instrument and we will probably do some things with instruments. We may do some things with just keyboards or we may do a full-blown big band arrangement with horns and everything,'' he said. `` Of course there will be gospel music, but we may do some bossa nova types of things, some funkier types of things and, of course, jazz. We want to show that we are versatile and can do other types of music.'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> says the change might upset some fans. `` I think there will be some purists who will say: ` Aw, they've defiled it They've added instruments.' But at the same time when you do something and you do it well, then you will gain new fans and you will preserve the old ones.'' Like Take 6, <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> urges other artists, especially aspiring ones, to put their best work forward. Much of the music produced these days is poorly crafted fluff that has no lasting value, he said. `` There's a lot of things that just are n't done well. Strive for excellence,'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said. `` There is a market out there for quality. That is why a lot of people have longevity.''

 <PERSON> Susanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barstad </PERSON> did n't know a modem from a disk drive, but she and other residents of <LOCATION> Sheyenne </LOCATION> Care Center have learned that computers can be as easy to use as a horse and buggy. `` I figured you're never too old to learn if you want to try,'' the cheery 90-year-old said. `` I've always had a curiosity about trying new things.'' Barstad is among 19 residents of the nursing home who use a computer to write to pen pals around the country through a network called SeniorNet. The nonprofit organization has trained more than 3,500 people on personal computers at 30 sites in 13 states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> since 1986. Sites include doctors offices, senior centers and colleges, but <ORGANIZATION> Sheyenne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> is the only nursing home, said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwehr </PERSON>, the center's <ORGANIZATION> SeniorNet </ORGANIZATION> coordinator. <PERSON> Schwehr </PERSON> believes the program keeps the residents' minds alert and helps ward off institutional depression. `` I think it boosts their self-esteem, their confidence. And it's an easy way for them to establish friendships with people in other parts of the country.'' While some of the residents balked at using the computer, Barstad jumped at the chance. `` I knew computers are going to be the wave of the future. ... I was happy when they asked me to come down and try it.'' <PERSON> Barstad </PERSON>, a retired nurse, corresponds with three other seniors, including an author in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and a former journalist in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barb </PERSON> <PERSON> Svenningsen </PERSON>, a volunteer who helps the residents operate the computer, said some still hesitate to use it. `` Their first question is, ` How much is it going to cost?' But those that get on it and realize they can do it _ they really seem to like it.'' SeniorNet evolved from a computer class and user manual, `` Computers for Kids over 60,'' by <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Furlong </PERSON>, an associate professor of education at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> and now executive director of <ORGANIZATION> SeniorNet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Furlong </PERSON> started it because she felt senior citizens had been left out of the computer revolution of the'80s. `` What I've learned in the past six years is that older adults have a great deal of wisdom to share If we give them access to these tools ... we as a society stand to learn a great deal.'' Recognizing a relatively untapped market for computers and information services, industry has been eager to help <ORGANIZATION> SeniorNet </ORGANIZATION> get off the ground. <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> donated $ 200,000 worth of computers to equip 11 training sites including <ORGANIZATION> Sheyenne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which received a keyboard, disk drive, monitor and printer. Users are billed only for the time something is sent over transmission lines, <PERSON> Furlong </PERSON> said. That averages about three or four hours a month at $ 12.60 an hour for most users. <ORGANIZATION> Sheyenne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s bills are paid for by the <ORGANIZATION> Markle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which has donated $ 700,000 to <ORGANIZATION> SeniorNet </ORGANIZATION>. The center joined after former administrator <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tourville </PERSON> heard about it at a national conference. <PERSON> Tourville </PERSON> and former marketing director <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> contacted <PERSON> Furlong </PERSON>, and in 1987 the nursing home was selected to join eight other sites in the country. `` We had absolutely nothing to lose by doing this _ because everything was donated _ and hundreds of things to gain,'' <PERSON> Schwehr </PERSON> said. `` This has given them a link with some of their younger family members because the children are learning about computers in school,'' she said. `` It gives them something to talk about, and that can mean so much to an elderly person.''

 The Rev. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> has talked with <PERSON> Mahatma </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghandi </PERSON> and drove <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first prime minister, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, around in a jeep. But to most of those who know him, he's simply `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>.'' `` I want to continue as long as I find people wanting to talk to me,'' said the 83-year-old Chicago-born Jesuit, ham license 9N1MM, the only private radio operator in this tiny Himalayan kingdom sandwiched between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Since he started out on the radio he built himself, <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> estimates he's talked to more than 80,000 ham operators. `` I used to talk to captains of ships at sea. They used to respond saying, ` Your signal is not good.''' In 1961, the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> sent him the radio he's used since. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> learned to make receivers from a friend in school. `` When I was 13, I used to sell them to my friends. The parts would cost me $ 90 ... I would sell it for $ 100. In those days $ 10 was good money.'' Those were also the days when broadcasting was young and no one had heard of television. `` I saw the development of radio and television from the very beginning. I was lucky to see the beginning.'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> set sail from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1929, in search of a new homeland in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. He settled first in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and became principal of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Xavier </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Patna </LOCATION> in the eastern Indian province of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>. It was there, in 1939, `` while I was in the middle of putting a high school in <LOCATION> Patna </LOCATION>, I met <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> _ the great man ... After a half hour talk with him I agreed to work for him,'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> recalls. `` In 1946, just before the end of the Second World War, I was going to shillong to give a retreat lecture before Christmas,'' he said, and <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, who a year later would become prime minister, was on the train. `` Nehru was then president of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Party -RRB-. Large crowds would come to see and hear him when the train stopped at railway stations, and when his microphone did not work his voice stopped and I went up to the speakers and connected the wires,'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. `` Nehru asked me, ` What is the name of your company which takes so good care of loudspeakers?' `` I said, ` I am sorry I am a Jesuit priest and an American missionary.''' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> met Nehru again in 1947 and drove him around <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> in his jeep during Hindu-Muslim rioting before the partition of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Two years later, as principal of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Patna </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> made his first trip to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, to conduct examinations for <ORGANIZATION> Patna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He moved to the mountain kingdom in 1951 so settle, intent on starting a boarding school. At the time, there was no airport, so he took a train to <LOCATION> Raxaul </LOCATION>, the last Indian township on the border, and made his way to <PERSON> Bhimphedi </PERSON> at the base of the Himalayan foothills. `` There were eight porters waiting for me with an ulinkath -LRB- an open palanquin -RRB-. Four of them carried me on it and four others followed, running behind them, changing turns every 10 minutes,'' he said. `` This was the only means of transportation system in those days to enter into the Nepalese capital. ... I saw even cars being carried by men on their shoulder along the trail. At <LOCATION> Bhimphedi </LOCATION>, people took off the wheels of a car and they put the car on top of two long logs with nine planks strapped sideways and 36 people in rows of four men carried it on the trail to Thankot.'' When <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> brought his own car into <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> that in 1951, however, he did it by air. Even so, he said, it was a Herculean effort. `` The door of the DC-3 was so narrow that I had to take off the back and front bumpers first. The car was pushed into the plane with barely an inch to spare to fit it in.'' Some of the plane's hinges had to be removed, and `` When I asked the pilot for his permission he said, ` I ca n't give permission to do so but if I go and take a cup of tea, I might not see it Hurry up.''' That year, <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> met Nehru a third time. The prime minister was visiting as a state guest, `` saw me at a civic reception standing among the huge crowd and told <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribhuvan </ORGANIZATION>, pointing at me, ` This is my most favorite driver.''' It was also the year that <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> established St. Xavier's, in an old maharaja's summer palace 5,000 feet up in the <LOCATION> Himalayan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> foothills </LOCATION>, where he still teaches five days a week _ when he does n't have his `` ears on.''

<TEXT>
 The old adage, `` an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,'' holds true for the flu. Each winter millions of Americans suffer the fever, aches and pains of influenza. Most recover from the effects in a week or so, but for many older people the flu and its complications are extremely serious. While the body's immune system is busy fighting the flu, a person is less capable of resisting another life-threatening infection like pneumonia. Older people and those with chronic diseases such as heart disese, emphysema, asthma and diabetes have the greatest risk of developing pneumonia along with the flu. And older people are more likely to require hospitalization. Flu and pneumonia combined are the sixth leading cause of death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and 80 to 90 percent of the deaths are in people 65 and older. But flu and its complications need not be deadly, and can be prevented by vaccinating high-risk individuals six to eight weeks before the season begins. Influenza is caused by a virus that infects the nose, throat and lungs. Flu travels quickly, especially during winter in crowded indoor places like malls, grocery stores, theaters and hospitals. When someone with the flu coughs or sneezes, droplets containing particles of the virus spread to other people. After infection, symptoms usually appear in two to four days; the disease continues to be contagious for another three to four days. Once the virus enters the body, it multiplies and causes a variety of well-known complaints, including chills and fever, headache, runny nose, sore throat and a dry cough. Extreme weakness and muscle aches and pains often last for several days. If the virus invades the lungs, viral pneumonia can develop. To prevent the flu, people 65 and older and residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities should be vaccinated. Also, health professionals, nursing home workers and family members who live with someone over 65 should get a flu shot to avoid spreading the disease to those at risk. Unlike other viruses, the flu virus changes from time to time. Because different strains of the virus tend to spread flu each season, a new vaccine is prepared every year. It contains strains of the flu virus recently circulating worldwide and believed likely to hit during the coming winter. Nicknames such as the `` Spanish flu'' and `` <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> flu'' refer to places where large outbreaks of new flu strains have first appeared. The vaccine is made from highly purified, killed viruses. Because the flu shot does not contain infectious viruses, it does not cause the flu. The most common side effect is a sore arm, which occurs in less than one-third of those vaccinated and usually lasts only a day or so. A few people also may develop a brief, low-grade fever and some minor aches and pains, which begin six to 12 hours after vaccination and can persist for one or two days. If a person has no special reason not to take aspirin, low doses -LRB- such as one tablet every three to four hours -RRB- usually will relieve these symptoms. Immediate allergic reactions, such as hives, rarely occur after influenza vaccination. Anyone allergic to eggs, which are used to grow the virus for the vaccine, should NOT receive the vaccine since some egg protein may be present. Since the flu vaccine takes several weeks to work, the best time to be vaccinated is in November. A vaccine also is available against the most common types of bacteria which cause pneumonia. The flu shot can be given at the same time as the pneumonia vaccine without increasing the side effects. The flu shot must be given every year, but the pneumonia vaccine should be given only once. In addition to the flu shot, an antiviral drug _ amantadine _ can prevent infection by certain strains. The drug is useful for people who have not had the vaccine or as extra protection for those who have been immunized. When taken soon after the early signs are felt, amantadine reduces the duration of fever and other symptoms. It also can prevent infection if taken during the entire four - to six-week course of a flu epidemic After people stop taking the drug, they become susceptible to the virus again. It occasionally causes difficulty sleeping, impaired concentration and dizziness, and has been associated with falls in older people. As with all medication, patients should take it only with a doctor's recommendation.

In fact, Pleasure, his 1990 All-American, is the best in mass plantings. `` One of the main reasons people do n't grow roses is they do n't want to take care of them, so if you remove that reason you get more customers,'' said <PERSON> Warriner </PERSON>, 67, who retired from <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Perkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I do think it's a shame more people, especially retirees, do n't enjoy the pleasure of gardening. There are about 60 rose bushes growing in the 90-by-90-foot landscape of his home in <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb where he's lived the past 20 years. There's also a small vegetable garden and a couple each of avocado, orange, lemon, lime and persimmon trees. It's all pretty low-key. Of his roses, <PERSON> Warriner </PERSON> says, `` Now I just like to look at them, smell them, enjoy them. What I'm looking for is beauty in the landscape.'' Pink-blooming Pleasure was propagated before his 1987 retirement as vice president of research at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, the rose-selling giant. So were his 1989 All-Americans _ Tournament of Roses and Class Act. It can be eight years from propagation to possible designation by <ORGANIZATION> All-America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization of most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rose producers, so there may be more <PERSON> Warriner </PERSON> winners. He has 15, more than anyone in the 50-year-old competition. Announcements are n't made for two years after the selection to give growers time to produce plants for sale. Pleasure will be available this spring. I planted two test plants in March. The desert climate is a severe test but Pleasure, a floribunda, produced numerous flowers and good foliage. Compared to others, however, the flowers dropped their petals quickly after being cut. `` Sometimes a rose that holds too long makes a poor landscape subject because the flowers dry and stay on the <PERSON> bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Warriner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Warriner </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, has never been sure why he's always had a keen interest in flowers He went to <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> because of its horticuture reputation. He also made the boxing team as a middleweight, `` which probably cut off a lot of joking about my love of flowers.'' He still can make the weight, `` although the pounds are distributed a lot differently.'' As a hybridizer, he patented about 110 rose varieties. <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> estimates 41 million of his roses have been sold. Besides the 1989 and 1990 All-Americans, they include such standbys as Simplicity, Cherish, Love, Honor, Intrigue, Impatient, Sun Flare, Medallion, French Lace and Color Magic. <PERSON> Warriner </PERSON> never developed a personal favorite and says it's a thrill to see any of his growing somewhere `` because it means you did something right. `` I look on each variety in a different way. The variety that more people have grown than anything else is Simplicity. But it's certainly not the most beautiful variety I've created And so it's hard to say what the favorite is It would change every year, depending on my goals in hybridizing at the time.'' The most difficult part of hybridizing, he feels, is deciding which roses to use for the crosses. One parent of Pleasure is Intrigue, but <PERSON> Warriner </PERSON> said he never used it in hybridizing because `` it does n't really bloom enough to be a good parent, although it's a very clean plant and fragrant. But when he saw a certain seedling he recalled Intrigue's strong points and thought the combination had possibilities. He does n't recall now what it was that grabbed his attention `` We rarely had less than 150,000 seedlings. `` You go through them in the spring and summer on almost a daily basis and pick out those that look like they might have potential, and discard those with none. The first year we'd select perhaps 1,000 seedling varieties for further propagation. The next year more would be eliminated. After going through the procedure about three times, what's left are just a few varieties.'' How possible is it that the `` perfect rose'' is growing somewhere, but the owner does n't realize it and no one else sees it? `` I certainly would n't go looking for it. Roses have to be developed. I do n't see how the natural process can produce a winning specimen.''

 The nation's nursing homes need new ways to watch over `` wanderers,'' the thousands of patients _ especially <PERSON> Alzheimer </PERSON>'s victims _ who are prone to walking around, says a researcher seeking a high-tech solution. In three months of study at an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> nursing home, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Martino-Saltzman </PERSON> identified two patterns _ `` meandering,'' in which patients wander aimlessly, and `` circuiting,'' in which they walk laps around a defined area. The challenge for researchers is to find a way for nursing homes to deal with the problem without physical restraints or drugs, said <PERSON> Martino-Saltzman </PERSON>, a behavior specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here. His study involved pressure-sensitive floor mats that would detect electronic tags worn by patients. The computerized system allowed the patients to wander, but alerted workers when the patients were where they should n't be. Such systems can be prohibitively expensive for small nursing homes, he said. `` Small nursing homes ca n't afford a $ 100,000 system. It behooves us to come up with something that's affordable.

<HEAD>Opposition to Social Security `Earnings Test' Mounting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Depression-era law that cuts Social Security benefits for older people who work faces growing opposition from congressional critics who say it pushes seniors out of the labor force when the nation needs them. Benefit reductions from the so-called `` earnings test'' can combine with federal, state and local taxes to produce such high marginal tax rates that many older workers do just as well staying home, foes say. `` It is a tremendous disincentive to work and a tremendous incentive to just give up and throw in the towel,'' said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo. `` The marginal tax rate on some people is easily 80 percent and in some cases more. Workers aged 65-69 this year lose $ 1 in Social Security benefits for every $ 2 earned over $ 8,880, and beneficiaries under 65 face a similar reduction for earnings in excess of $ 6,480 _ a 50 percent effective marginal tax rate by itself. There is no limit for those 70 and older. In 1990, the threshold is scheduled to rise to $ 9,360 for those 65-69 and $ 6,840 for those under 65, and the penalty will be less severe for those 65 and above: a $ 1 reduction in benefits for every $ 3 in excess earnings. But several proposals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would relax the limits further, and calls for repeal are gaining new allies. Each year almost 1 million Social Security beneficiaries aged 65-69 lose some or all of their benefits because of the earnings test, and another 100,000 do n't file for benefits because of it. Others stop working, deliberately hold their earnings to just under the threshold or hide excess wages from the government to avoid the loss of benefits. A 67-year-old woman who works at a county courthouse in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> recently wrote to her congressman that `` because of the earnings limit, it just does n't pay to work beyond the $ 8,880 limit.'' <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haeworth </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, chief actuary for the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> from 1975-78, once had a maid who quit because he insisted on paying Social Security taxes on her wages, which would have alerted the government to her earnings. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> believes the earnings test is justified, but predicted its days are numbered because of mounting opposition. Those seeking to relax the limits include Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, who recalled that the woman who took care of his son faced such a big tax bite on her wages due to the earnings test that she `` would've been better off if we had simply given her big presents'' at Christmas and other holidays. `` It certainly made it clear to us that the system needed to be changed,'' <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> said. `` This will be around for a while, but certainly the trend and the momentum is toward elimination.'' Critics say the earnings test _ created along with <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> in the Depression when older Americans were being encouraged to retire to free up jobs for young workers _ is an anachronism at a time when policymakers are trying to keep older people working longer and labor markets are tight. They also argue that it discriminates against working-class Americans because the benefit reductions are linked only to earnings, and are unaffected by unearned income such as pensions, rent and dividends. Supporters, meanwhile, maintain it is only fair to limit the retirement benefits paid to those still pulling in a paycheck. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> from 1962-73, said there is merit to the original concept of paying Social Security benefits to make up for earnings lost because of retirement. `` We've already departed from that a long way and I do n't see any reason to go further in the direction of making the program a straight annuity,'' he said. That view is shared by <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who said too many people believe Social Security benefits are an earned right they bought and paid for. Most workers get back far more in benefits than they paid in taxes, government figures show. A typical worker who retired at 65 in 1988 had paid about $ 12,000 in Social Security taxes, which will be recovered in benefits in two years. The average retiree goes on to collect benefits for 15 to 20 years. `` If you repeal it, you're giving in to this propaganda that this is a pension, that it bears some relationship to what you paid in taxes, and that is just not true,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. After years of unsuccessful legislative jostling on the earnings test, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appears ready to relax the restrictions over the next two years. The House this fall passed a proposal to boost the earnings threshold to $ 9,720 next year and $ 10,440 in 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> passed a more generous plan to up the limits to $ 11,700 next year and then to $ 14,520. Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> voiced support for both proposals, saying they would `` encourage seniors to remain in the workforce and contribute their knowledge and experience to the nation's economy.'' There also is growing support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for outright repeal. About 150 House members are co-sponsoring a bill introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastert </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., that would eliminate the test for those 65 and above Many Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> long have favored repeal of the earnings test, but the idea now is gaining support among Democrats, said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, a scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is far more likely that it'll be repealed or at least loosened.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> supports the concept of scrapping the earnings test, but is n't pushing for action because it says repeal would cost too much _ $ 25.3 billion over five years. `` The idea of eliminating the earnings test is the right way to go,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON>. `` All the belief and the logic behind it still exists, it's just the costs that are the problem.'' Some advocates for repeal, however, believe that scrapping the test would actually save money by returning thousands of retirees to the workforce. Two conservative research groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Innovation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION>, this fall issued a study predicting that at least 700,000 retirees would enter the labor market if the earnings limit were repealed, generating $ 140 million more in new, work-related taxes than the cost of the additional Social Security benefits that would be paid.

 Our star, recently turned 50, is waking up, smelling the coffee, and starting to give up that infatuation with young love. But memories linger ... Sound like the plot for a TV movie? It's actually the plot for television itself, advertising and TV executives say, as shows like `` The Golden Girls'' draw big audiences and stars like <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> shine. `` The audience is getting older,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president for planning and research. `` The major population shift is the aging of the baby boomers. When they were young television was very youth-oriented. `` Gradually, the television networks are recognizing that the advantage is to go with this aging baby boomer generation.'' <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, at 64, is still the most popular talk show host. And when CBS' `` Lonesome Dove'' bowled over the competition last spring with aging <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> plainsmen <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'' took the case and saved <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> from disaster. The <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> role appeals mainly to older viewers. While the population is aging and older people have more disposable income, advertisers are slow to recognize the changes. `` We do n't go as far as <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> would like us to go,'' said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>, the world's largest ad agency. `` CBS has always been more successful when it programs for a more mature audience. Even <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is making some concessions toward older audiences. Its ` <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Mystery Movie' has older stars and should do well with older viewers on Saturday night. But <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> has succeeded by targeting a very young audience.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> sees a shift to buying demographics of age 25-54. <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, agrees the audience is aging and has more money, `` but you also have to look at consumer habits. `` Is the person who is 61 years old who's bought <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Coffee for 40 years really a good target for your new <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roast </ORGANIZATION>? I recognize that they have more income but I would be careful about their buying habits. `` Our standard approach is to come up with a good show that has as widespread an appeal as possible. ` Golden Girls' is a show that recognizes the graying of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> but it's universal in its appeal. It attracts teen-agers and young people as well. It defies advertisers who thought it would be a show that would appeal to only people over 50.'' <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> believes older viewers will be more of a factor in the 1990s. `` The phenomenon of shows about older people is quite new to television,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, a consultant who formerly headed programming at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We always had older people in family shows, but the shows were always about kids and their problems. What you have now are shows built around the problems that older people face. The remarkable thing about ` The Golden Girls' is that its audience cuts through all age groups. One show is a hit, two is a trend. You clearly have that taking place today.'' The problems older characters face are n't geriatric. They're the usual mix of romance, sex, appearance, divorce, and the conflicts of human nature. Although favorable demographics is still the preferred method of advertiser selection, audience size is important and becoming more so, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> said. `` Years ago I personally canceled <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> with a 37 share and <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> with a 36 share. You wo n't find a television executive doing that today. `` Things are so competitive today with new delivery systems and a fourth network that it's difficult to get a large rating for a new show. I do n't know of anybody today who would cancel a show with a 30 share.'' <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> has become adept at producing hit shows that appeal to older viewers. `` In the Heat of the Night,'' `` <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> and the Fatman,'' and the `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'' movies all have older stars. `` The Father Dowling Mysteries'' was dropped by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> but has been picked up by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. In the new season, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Island Son,'' `` Snoops,'' `` <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>,'' `` Major Dad'' and `` Peaceable Kingdom'' are aimed at older viewers. So are <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Chicken Soup'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The <ORGANIZATION> Nutt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` Hardball'' and `` Mancuso <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.'' Movies and miniseries also lean heavily toward the older audience. `` The networks are sticking with stars and shows that have worked in the past,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. `` It's not that we're seeing the graying of television. What we're seeing is each network concentrate more on the things they do best. Because older viewers do watch more television, you may be seeing more older stars that appeal to that audience.'' <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> contends that the network trend toward more news and reality shows is based on more than just the fact that such shows are less expensive. `` When people pass 40 they become more interested in news and information-based shows. The networks are losing audience to competitors but the news and information shows are stable. You'll see more of these shows in the 1990s. A dissenter is <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, media buyer for 14 big companies representing $ 175 million in network ads. `` I think ` The Golden Girls' was a phenomenon in itself and all the imitations will bite the dust quickly. When you buy time on shows that appeal to older people you pay for an enormous waste of circulation. `` Young people are still the key to high prices on a network. The most expensive show on TV today is ` Cheers' because of its enormous appeal to the 18-49 audience. ` The Cosby Show' has a higher rating, but it attracts a large number of kids. The aim of every network programmer is to get another ` Cheers' or ` Roseanne.' At <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, ` Wiseguy' does n't get a big rating but that's the show all the advertisers ask for because of its young demographics.''

 Aging is characterized by abrupt declines in mental ability often caused by personal experiences like forced retirement or a heart attack, according to a long-term study that suggests some precautions. The 33-year <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longitudinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> has tracked the intellectual ability of more than 4,000 people ranging in age from their 20s to their 90s. `` What we have to do now is document scientifically what anecdotally we have seen all along,'' said <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaie </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Gerontology Center. `` That people do n't age the same way. Most aging studies have looked at group averages for different age groups, rather than tracking changes in individuals over time, <PERSON> Shaie </PERSON> said. Every seven years, the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> study researchers test five areas: verbal meaning, spatial orientation, inductive reasoning, and number and word fluency. People maintain their mental abilities, on average, into their 60s, <PERSON> Shaie </PERSON> said. `` From then on, on average, you can find some decline.'' By 67 more than half the participants showed declines in reasoning ability, though verbal ability did n't decline for most until their late 70s. `` Inductive reasoning tends to decline sooner, because it involves speed of response,'' <PERSON> Shaie </PERSON> said. `` Between age 20 and 60, reaction time approximately doubles, so any skill requiring high levels of speed is vulnerable.'' Researchers recently looked at 838 participants who had suffered a significant drop in one or more of the five abilities over the previous seven years, and found a link to jarring events in their lives, such as the death of a spouse and mental decline, <PERSON> Shaie </PERSON> said. People who are open to change, active and continue to learn either formally or informally tend to age more slowly. `` It's more of a use it or lose it proposition,'' he said. Some of the major risk factors are an unstimulating or sedentary life, low education level with no effort to continue learning and heart disease, he said. As part of his research, <PERSON> Shaie </PERSON> also studied 120 people age 60 or older who had shown significant declines in mental ability. Their abilities in many cases could be improved by five hours of cognitive training sessions, in which trainers led subjects in a series of increasingly difficult mental exercises. For example, to improve spatial orientation, the subjects were told to mentally rotate increasingly abstract objects. `` Can you teach an old dog new tricks? The answer to that is of course you can teach an old dog new tricks,'' <PERSON> Shaie </PERSON> said. `` It may take a little longer. As long as you are alive, usually you are capable of learning.'' Several of those who failed to improve have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, the mysterious affliction that robs people of intellectual ability. <PERSON> Shaie </PERSON> began his research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>. `` The argument is, you gain with experience. By that token, the older you are, the smarter you ought to be,'' he said. `` But, on the other hand, when we compare young and old people we find that at some point older people seem not to do as well as younger people. I got intrigued by this paradox.''

<HEAD>Forbes Ranks 200 Best Small Companies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> shoe chain walked to the top of the Forbes 1989 list of the `` 200 Best Small Companies in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' outpacing insurers, specialty retailers and restaurants that dominated the rankings. Boston-based <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a newcomer to the list, took the honors with the highest return on equity _ a five-year average of 100 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Nov. 13 issue, on sale today. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Allwaste </ORGANIZATION>, which sells pollution control equipment and services, came in second with a five-year average ROE of 77.1 percent. Third was <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microwave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Edina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, maker of popcorn and breakfast foods, with a 59.1 percent <PERSON> ROE </PERSON>. Both also were newcomers. Forbes evaluated more than 4,000 publicly traded companies nationwide with sales in the latest 12 months of $ 5 million to $ 350 million for the 10th annual list. Besides high return on equity, companies were graded on `` consistency in earnings growth and balance-sheet strength,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. Return on equity, considered one of the best yardsticks of a company's performance, shows annual profits as a percent of net worth. ROE is calculated by dividing stockholders equity into net income. The most profitable company on the list was <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, a mutual fund management concern based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and ranked fifth with a 53.5 percent five-year ROE. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s profit rose 17 percent to $ 74.25 million in the latest 12 months. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> also would have given investors the biggest bang for the buck _ $ 10,000 invested in the company five years ago would be worth $ 132,528 today, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. Among the entire group, insurers had 15 entries, followed by specialty retailers with 12 and restaurants with 11. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> led all states with the most companies on the Forbes list, 23. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> were the top cities, each with 10, followed by <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, with six each. Forbes first published the best small company list in 1979 under the title `` Up and Comer.'' An investment of $ 10,000 in each of the top 100 companies that year would today be worth $ 4.8 million, a compound annual rate of 17 percent, the magazine said. By <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>' calculations, the same amount invested in the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poors </ORGANIZATION> 500 would now be worth $ 3.2 million. Rounding out the top 10 were: <PERSON> Tech-Ops </PERSON> <PERSON> Landauer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, -LRB- radiation monitoring services -RRB-, with 54.5 percent ROE; <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resouces </ORGANIZATION>; Quiksilver, <PERSON> Anaheim-Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ana </PERSON>, -LRB- casual sportswear -RRB-, 52.7 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Colonial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Class A -RRB-, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, -LRB- fund management -RRB-, 50.9 percent; One Price Clothing Store, <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, -LRB- discount apparel stores -RRB-, 47.4 percent; International Dairy Queen -LRB- Class A -RRB-, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, -LRB- fast-food restaurants -RRB-, 42.8 percent; and <ORGANIZATION> Shorewood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packaging </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, -LRB- packaging materials -RRB-, 39.9 percent. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said it eliminated from consideration limited partnerships, estate investment trusts and companies with stocks that sell for less than $ 5 or have a small amount of publicly traded stocks.

<HEAD>Whittle Signs 500 Schools for Channel One</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 500 schools with nearly 345,000 students have signed up for the launch of the advertiser-supported Channel One daily news show for the classroom set to debut this spring, the project sponsor said. <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based media company, said Sunday the subscriptions during the first eight weeks of active recruitment of schools puts the project halfway toward its goal of having 1,000 schools equipped to receive the show at launch in March 1990. It now expects to have 1,000 schools signed up by the end of this year. The Channel One project has come under fierce attack by national educational groups, state officials in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and others who object to giving advertisers a platform for pitching products to students in the classroom. Channel One plans to send a 12-minute news show geared toward students to participating schools every weekday. Each show will contain two minutes of paid advertising. In exchange for the running the show, schools get about $ 50,000 each in television monitors, videocassette recorders and satellite dishes. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, said his salesmen have approached about 1,290 school districts representing 3,855 schools in 24 states so far. He said 10 percent of the districts have rejected the offer, schools in 238 districts have signed up and talks continue in the rest. He said he expects to have no trouble meeting the longer-term goal of having 7,000 to 8,000 schools participating in the program by the end of 1990. `` This documents what we thought: that local educators would view this very differently than national ones,'' he said. `` Some critics are going to be very surprised.'' Installation of equipment is expected to begin in January. Whittle has previously said it had signed contracts with advertisers who have bought 56 percent of the available commercial time on Channel One for the first year of programming.

<HEAD>Average Cost of Bouncing Checks Going Up, Newsletter Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The average fee banks charge for bouncing a check has increased in the past two years, and it varies widely from city to city, according to a survey by an industry newsletter. Today's edition of Bank Rate Monitor says the average fee for writing a check on insufficient funds in a checking account was $ 16.13 on Oct. 25. That's up from $ 15.30 in April 1987, when it last did the survey. The highest fees were found in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where some banks charge as much as $ 30 for a bounced check, while the lowest were reported in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where some charge customers less than $ 10, according to the Palm Beach-based newsletter's survey of 110 institutions in major markets. The publication said it found much the same variance in 1987. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> McGeever </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, gave competition as the reason Philadelphia-area banks charge more. <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> raised its fee from from $ 25 to $ 30 on Oct. 1. `` We perceived the whole market was moving upward,'' she told the newsletter. `` People who had been at $ 20 were going to $ 25. People at $ 25 were going to $ 30. I think it was a competitively driven decision.'' But she thought $ 30 would be the upper limit, at least for awhile. `` You may see some people below $ 30 coming up to $ 30, but I do n't think you'll see a lot who will go higher than that.'' The newsletter also reported that the number of banks and thrifts charging more than $ 15 per bounced check increased to 44 from 34. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, which raised its bounced-check fee from $ 17.50 to $ 20 last year, said banks need to consider the fact that bouncing a check is against the law, not just what it costs to reprocess the check. `` If you write checks in excess of the amount in the account, you are attempting to get an interest-free loan from the bank,'' he told the publication. He suggested customers have an account with overdraft protection, perhaps covered by a credit card. Bank Rate Monitor tracks average interest rates, fees and charges by major banks, thrifts and credit unions nationwide on a weekly basis.

<HEAD>Junk Bond Woes Prompt Rail Company To Change Financing For Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A skittish junk bond market forced buyers of <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to make significant last-minute changes in the financing of their $ 1.6 billion buyout of the railroad company, officials involved in the plan said. The group planned to issue $ 475 million in high-yield, or junk, bonds as the final financing of the leveraged buyout to take the company private. But in a two-week trip to nearly two dozen cities, officials of <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the underwriters of the bond offering, discovered buyer resistance. The buyout group consists of <ORGANIZATION> DLJ </ORGANIZATION>, railroad company <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> is the parent of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a 6,000-mile railroad with 8,500 employees that operates in nine states, most of them in the Midwest. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> DLJ </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield securities operations, said Friday that potential buyers of the railroad company's securities indicated they wanted equity as well as better terms for the junk bonds `` It's a skittish market,'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. The result is that <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION>'s buyers will make a public equity offering amounting to 10 percent of the ownership. <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION>, which holds 72 percent of the stock, and <ORGANIZATION> DLJ </ORGANIZATION>, which took 22 percent, each will give up a portion of their holdings on a pro-rata basis for the initial public offering. The remaining 6 percent is held by management, led by Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmiege </PERSON>. In five years, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> is expected to convert $ 100 million in preferred shares into 25 percent ownership. The buyers also agreed to raise the yield on the junk bonds by one quarter of 1 percent to 14.75 percent. <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> DLJ </ORGANIZATION> estimates the added interest will amount to $ 2 million a year. In addition, the buyers have agreed to reset the interest rate 12 months from now to a level that will allow the bonds to trade at 101 percent of face value. That lowers the risk for buyers who are leery of the value of junk bonds in the current market. Trouble in the junk bond market erupted last month when Canadian retail company <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would have trouble making payments on its high-yield debt. Since then, other junk bond issues have plunged in price.

<HEAD>Congestion Problems Grow With Record Number of Passengers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Airlines carried a record number of passengers last year, boosting worldwide profits to $ 1.6 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a report for release today. <ORGANIZATION> IATA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual report, released on the eve of its general assembly in the Polish capital, predicted another bumper year in 1989, but warned that air congestion would limit future expansion, especially in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In a bid to improve security and safety measures, <ORGANIZATION> IATA </ORGANIZATION> said it planned to step up checks on airport security and review the problem of human error in air crashes. Air congestion and security are expected to be the main themes at <ORGANIZATION> IATA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting. The report said <ORGANIZATION> IATA </ORGANIZATION>'s 187 member airlines carried 632 million passengers last year, a 2 percent rise over the record set in 1987. Of these, 190 million flew on international scheduled flights, more than 6 percent more than in 1987. A further 22 million people flew on domestic and international charter flights. It predicted international scheduled passenger traffic would grow 8 percent in 1989 and 1990, although it should drop back to about 7 percent in the following three years. The report said the most rapid expansion should be in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Air traffic in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is expected to grow at a rate of about 6 percent a year. Insufficient airport capacity could limit growth in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where congestion problems are most acute, it said. `` The lack of adequate airport and air space capacity to meet current and future demand continues to be the major problem facing the air transport industry today,'' the report commented. <ORGANIZATION> IATA </ORGANIZATION> has identified 35 airports in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as `` congested,'' and has said that <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and the Japanese cities of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> also are suffering from lack of airport space. The report said that the bomb explosion aboard <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, showed flaws in the implementation of security measures. It said that <ORGANIZATION> IATA </ORGANIZATION> planned to increase the number and frequency of airport surveys around the world under its Intensified Aviation Security Program. There were 20 plane crashes in 1988, five more than the previous year. Human error was the main cause of 16 of the crashes. The statistics did not list losses caused by terrorism or sabotage. <ORGANIZATION> IATA </ORGANIZATION> is to hold a conference within the next two years to overhaul the industry's approach to the problem of the `` human factor,'' it said. It said recent accidents have led to growing concern about the structural safety of older aircraft. But excess demand for new planes was forcing many airlines to modify rather than replace older aircraft. This would add to costs and impose yet another constraint on the industry's growth, it added. The increase in demand for air travel boosted total profits of airlines belonging to the Geneva-based association to $ 1.6 billion last year, up from $ 900 million in 1987 and compared with a loss of $ 300 million in 1986.

<HEAD>Foreign Business Executives Find Chinese Managers Cautious, Scared</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign business executives who attended an international forum here found Chinese managers preoccupied with the government's current ideological campaign and imbued with a `` wait-and-see, cover-your-back attitude.'' Foreign executives who attended the 9th symposium in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of the Geneva-based World Economic Forum also said it was clear during the three-day session last week that Chinese leaders were willing to let many private and collective business enterprises `` go down the drain.'' The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Chinese also said they were studying devaluation of the yuan and for the first time in 1990 may roll over some the nation's foreign debt. They said that in meetings with Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> and other officials the Chinese emphasized that the nation's economic reforms and open-door policy were unaffected by the June crackdown on pro-democracy dissent and the subsequent conservative backlash against Western liberalism. They said the Chinese urged the delegates from 65 foreign companies to see for themselves that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remains eager to do business with the outside world. But they said that during the meetings, which ended Friday, there was constant reference to upholding the socialist line, and that `` everyone was quite careful to put themselves in an ideological framework.'' They said this was quite different from past meetings, when politics was never mentioned. The sources said the more than 100 Chinese managers who attended the forum were preoccupied with the question of increased <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> interference in the workplace, one aspect of the campaign to assure the party a leading role in all areas of society. `` The relationship of party and manager was clearly foremost in their minds,'' one of the sources said. They said they received conflicting signals on whether increased party authority would apply to joint Chinese-foreign ventures, and whether employees of joint ventures would be subject to government plans to have recent college graduates work at the grass-roots level for several years. The sources said the Chinese were generally more subdued than in previous years and were cautious in their statements. `` They are very scared to say anything that might backlash on them,'' one said. They said the central role of state companies was repeatedly emphasized, and that, in contrast to previous years, only one private entrepreneur participated in the forum. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s conservative leaders, in stressing that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must remain a socialist state, have relegated the nation's thriving non-government companies to a minor role in the economy. Higher taxes and the inability to obtain credit have driven many smaller enterprises out of business. The sources said party chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> was convincing in his pledges that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will remain open, although he was blunt in stating that the nation's open-door policy will always have a socialist framework. Chinese officials said the government might resort to taking out new loans to repay loans due next year. They said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which has a foreign debt of more than $ 40 billion, owes somewhere between $ 4 and $ 9 billion next year. Officials also said the current austerity program designed to curb economic growth and slow inflation could last two to five years more. The squeeze on credit and cutback on building projects has affected many joint ventures, and the business executives were told foreign investors will have to bring their own money.

<HEAD>Auto Industry Turns Downward; Dealers Urged to Exercise Clout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As automakers fight to hold their shares of a shrinking automobile market, the nation's dealers _ the companies' first customers _ are being urged to toughen their act <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto dealers have been watching their profits slide. Industry estimates indicate that one of every two dealers are either losing money or just breaking even. And now, the president of the nation's largest dealer organization is urging the businesses to make drastic cost-cutting moves. It appears to be another step in a growing militancy among the 20,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkin </PERSON> took over earlier this year as the organization's president Weeks ago, as automakers prepared for the Oct. 1 beginning of the 1990 model year, dealers said they would cut their orders, perhaps by as much as 30 percent of last year's. <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION>, through an advertisement in automotive trade magazines, is turning up the heat. He is urging dealers to take cost-cutting action, especially in `` flooring.'' Flooring is the money paid, mostly in interest, to hold unsold automobiles on dealership lots. It is one of the biggest expenses for dealers, <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> said. Cutting inventory will cut stock-carrying costs, he said. Before the advertisement appeared, dealers had begun cutting their orders. On Thursday, when the companies reported sharply lower third-quarter earnings, officials with each of the Big Three automakers confirmed that recent dealer orders were lower than a year ago. They declined to say by how much. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s Automotive Reports, a weekly industry newsletter, said domestic automakers' dealers had a 59-day supply of cars on hand at the end of September. The Fast Track News, a sales-oriented newsletter published every 10 days by <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said dealers had a 66-day car supply on hand as of Oct. 20. <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> suggested that a dealer who had considered a normal supply to be about 60 days slash that to 15 to 30 days. `` Let's face it,'' he said. `` If every dealer in this country decided that they had 50 percent too much inventory, if it all happened at once, it's going to impact production.'' While helping dealers cut their costs and improve their profits, such a move could further hurt manufacturers who already have taken these hits: _ The companies have said that incentive programs, which gnawed away at profits during the first three quarters of this year, probably will continue into the fourth quarter and 1990, but at lower levels _ Vehicle sales this year are predicted to be somewhere between 14.5 million and 15 million cars and light trucks That would be down significantly from the 15.6 million sold in 1988. _ The sales downturn likely will result in more production cuts, analysts have said, mostly coming in short-term downtime for `` inventory adjustment. _ Third-quarter profits for the nation's Big Three automakers, reported last week, were 27.3 percent below last year's earnings And executives with each company have said the pressure on profits wo n't let up for at least a year. `` The outgrowth of this,'' <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> said, `` has been a flexing of strength, a feeling on the part of dealers that they no longer have to fear stating their real feelings directly to the automakers and their -LRB- sales -RRB- representatives. `` Maybe it's time that they joined us,'' he said of the automakers. `` We have been in the red for some time.''

<HEAD>GM Plans to Build New Engine Plant in Europe, Sources Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is planning to build a new engine plant in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which might encompass plans for a joint components venture with <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, sources said Monday. Alternatively, a separate engine plant might be built as part of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> planned tie-up with the British luxury car maker, the sources said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has 31 manufacturing centers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, which has spurned advances from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> because it wants to remain independent, has been negotiating a cooperation agreement with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for several weeks. A <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with British practice, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto maker was committed to guaranteeing <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s independence, and described recent talks as `` well-advanced.'' A `` complex and detailed'' announcement of a joint agreement between <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> is to be made by <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> `` some time in the next two and a half weeks,'' a source said. The deal is expected to include plans for a jointly developed new auto model between <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, and a number of agreements for joint component production, sources close to the talks said. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, which eventually is expected to take a minority stake of up to 30 percent in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, would inject cash into the British company and make available its technology. In return, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> hopes to benefit from the <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> name, and thwart <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> from either linking up with, or taking over, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>. Sources close to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> said it has n't decided yet whether the new European engine plant would be built either in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` A key factor deciding if the plant will be built in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is whether the group can reach an agreement with unions at <ORGANIZATION> Vauxhall </ORGANIZATION> that they will speak with one voice,'' a source said. Four unions represent workers at <ORGANIZATION> Vauxhall </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> unit. Though the company is n't necessarily calling for a single union deal, it is `` looking for a new approach,'' a source said. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that it had received early <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory clearance to begin buying up to 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, which previously obtained the same clearance, has raised its stake in the British company to 13.2 percent. It has said it is prepared to launch a full bid after takeover restrictions are dropped. Both companies are prevented from raising their share in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> to over 15 percent by a `` golden share'' the British government holds in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> until the end of 1990.

 An investor group has offered to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> for $ 68 million as lawyers prepared for oral arguments in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a case involving a joint operating agreement with The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> McMaster </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, made the bid to buy the Free Press in a letter Sunday to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> which owns the newspaper. `` The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Investor Group, if successful in purchasing the Free Press, will continue the 158-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> as an ongoing enterprise and will convert the editorial format to a ` statewide community newspaper,' `` <PERSON> McMaster </PERSON> said in a news release. The owners of the two newspapers, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>, have said the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> would force the layoffs and a price increase <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has said it will sell the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> or close it if the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> is denied. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> headquarters were reviewing <PERSON> McMaster </PERSON>'s letter this morning and could not immediately comment on it, corporation spokeswoman <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Etzold </PERSON> said. Oral arguments were scheduled for today in the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> case. `` It's the time when all the elements of the case will converge, all the people involved will be together for the last time,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> opponents. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices may vote on the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> this week, but their decision is n't likely to be made public until next summer. Eight of the nine justices will vote. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> withdrew from the case citing personal reasons. A 4-4 tie would uphold the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>. The court may uphold two lower-court approvals of the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, reject the merger or instruct Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to reconsider the decision. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> represents <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a group of readers, advertisers, weekly newspaper <PERSON> Publisher </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendover </PERSON>, former News columnist <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Beer </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, D-Detroit. The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, which declared itself a failing newspaper in May 1986, filed under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 for permission to merge with The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> allows newspapers to combine business operations but maintain editorial independence. <PERSON> McMaster </PERSON> said he hoped to complete the purchase of the Free Press by the end of the year, provided the newspaper supplied the group with statements on its operations and assets. Opponents say the merger is prompted by greed and would hurt smaller area newspapers. Some question the independence of the two papers under a JOA. `` If this JOA is upheld, we will see the end of competitive journalism in this country by the end of the century,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON>, a News reporter and president of Local 22 of The Newspaper Guild.

<HEAD>EPA Official Warns Petroleum Producers of Oil Field Waste Hazards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Petroleum producers are n't doing enough to protect the environment from potentially hazardous oil field wastes and in some cases are n't using common sense, an <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` The oil and natural gas industry is way behind in waste management both in the volume and the toxicity of wastes generated,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonetti </PERSON>, acting deputy director for the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s waste management division, said Sunday <PERSON> Tonetti </PERSON> also said the industry needs more regulation at all government levels, especially in the area of commercialized waste management facilities. He spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> lasts through Tuesday. Oil producers, in some cases, are not using `` common sense'' when disposing of exploration and production wastes, allowing non-hazardous materials to be mixed with toxic chemicals, <PERSON> Tonetti </PERSON> said. If not disposed of properly, oil field wastes threaten public health and safety because wastes generated during oil exploration and production can wipe out groundwater supplies and contaminate soil, <PERSON> Tonetti </PERSON> said. Under the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, those wastes are exempt from hazardous waste regulations. But the act applies the exemption only to drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with crude oil or natural gas production. The exemption does not include unused chemicals, spent solvents, empty drums, used lubrication oils or acidic cleaners. These chemicals sometimes get mixed with non-hazardous wastes and create a hazardous substance and a health risk, <PERSON> Tonetti </PERSON> said. `` A lot of misunderstanding exists among producers about what is exempt and what is not,'' he said.

 The stock market gained ground today, bouncing back from last week's drop. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 92.42 points last week, climbed 14.35 to 2,611.07 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 640 up, 549 down and 525 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 41.37 million shares at midmorning. Analysts said the upswing was attributable to `` bargain hunting'' by traders attracted to stocks that have been hit by selling this month. They also noted hopes for evidence in the next few days that the economy was maintaining a moderate pace of growth, despite a recent barrage of disappointing corporate earnings reports. The government is due to report Tuesday on the index of leading economic indicators for September.

 The stock market posted some scattered gains today, steadying after last week's drop. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 92.42 points last week, climbed 12.09 to 2,608.81 by noontime on Wall Street. Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 631 up, 626 down and 543 unchanged. Analysts said the upswing was attributable to `` bargain hunting'' by traders attracted to stocks that have been hit by selling this month.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybeans Open Lower On Harvest; Wheat Mixed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Corn and soybean futures prices were mostly lower in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> while wheat futures were narrowly mixed. The slight drop in corn and soybean values partly reflected ideas that mild, dry weather allowed harvesting of those crops to continue at a rapid pace over the weekend. Rain forecast for later this week in the Corn Belt could hamper harvest activity. But with most of the crop already in, traders are focusing more on foreign demand and on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean crop, which is now being planted, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` They're behind normal and they need rain,'' he said of soybean producers in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The soybean market also was pressured by expectations that a large number of deliveries will be posted against the November soybean contract on Tuesday, the first day for traders to declare their intentions to deliver soybeans against the contract. Wheat futures were supported by expectations that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will soon make a major purchase of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. In early trading, wheat futures were 1 -RCB- cents lower to 1 cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 3.99 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at $ 2.41 \ a bushel; oat futures were -LCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.43 \ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with November at $ 5.60 a Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Again, The Issue Is Investor Confidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rascality and privilege are bad seed in the stock market, surviving repeated scandals and reforms and sprouting spontaneously again and again under the allure of easy or quick profits. Some important players think they see signs of the weed again. As in the past, there are many who see nothing wrong _ in this instance, with so-called program trading. Some of the most esteemed names in the industry defend the practice. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> accommodates program traders. But there are others _ brokers, big investors, mutual funds, listed companies among them _ who are determined to uproot the practice, saying it caters to privilege and in doing so destroys public confidence. These are individuals and institutions with real clout, and they are n't likely to back off. They are angry and determined. Program trading takes various forms, but the most controversial is stock-index arbitrage trading, or short-term, computer-triggered buying or selling to exploit brief inconsistencies between prices in spot and futures markets. Because it is based on market mechanics rather than underlying stock values, the strategy is called mindless. Mindless or not, some brokers play the game for their own accounts, regardless of the impact on their own customers. And, because the formula is shared, that impact can be explosive in either direction. One of the latest to vent outrage is the investment management firm of <ORGANIZATION> Neuberger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, which took full-page newspaper advertisements to demand an end to `` the numbers racket.'' Program trading, it said, serves no economic purpose `` except to line the pockets of a handful of institutions and individuals.'' In addition, it said, it causes mindless volatility, drives individual investors from the market, reduces stock values, and `` mocks the fundamental truth that the price of a stock should be based on its value.'' It is a type of insider trading, the company says, in which big players, hooked up directly to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> computers, buy and sell on 5 percent margin while other investors stand in line and must put up 50 percent. `` In short, program trading is nothing more than a numbers racket in which those running the numbers win, while individual investors, corporations, and the American economy lose.'' For those who follow stock market history, this is an old theme, an echo of similar instances in which it was alleged and sometimes shown that stock trading held special advantages for the powerful, making it in effect a club. The club is forever being broken up, most memorably following the crash of 1929 but again in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when some of the old-line brokers collapsed under an avalanche of paper and had to be dissolved. The shenanigans of the 1920s, culminating in the big collapse, had scared individuals from the market. In the 1960s, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> sought to regain them, urging investors to `` own your share of American business.'' Millions of small investors were lured into a market unprepared for them. Accounts were mishandled, client money was misused. Some brokers made easy profits, others lost on every sale. Individuals and institutions fell together. After that, government and the industry sought to reassure investors. A form of insurance was introduced, and to some extent it succeeded. Individuals remained a force _ but a shrinking one in relation to mutual and pension funds. In recent years, however, there is evidence of a further retreat from the market, in part because of market-manipulation scandals. Over the five years 1984-1988, individual investors cashed in a half-trillion dollars of shares. Last year the decline amounted to $ 105 billion. The selling continues in 1989. Once again, therefore, the issue is public confidence in the market, a market so volatile that even some of the biggest players are concerned. A sound market, they say, is a non-volatile one in which buying and selling is matched in an orderly fashion. A volatile market, they say, is prima facie evidence of one that is failing its customers.

<TEXT>
 Production workers at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> Horicon </LOCATION> ratified a 3-year contract Monday, ending a nearly month-long strike Members of Local 873 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> voted 666-205 in favor of the proposed 3-year contract, the company announced. The local has about 940 employees. `` We just received word that the contract passed by a 78 percent to 22 percent margin,'' said <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Combs </PERSON>. `` That obviously brings the strike to a conclusion.'' Combs and union officials declined to release details of the new contract, which will expire Oct. 1, 1991. `` It was a very comprehensive proposal,'' <PERSON> Combs </PERSON> said. `` Like any contract, -LRB- it -RRB- was a compromise.'' A tentative agreement was reached Friday after union representatives and company officials met for the entire day. Some employees will report back to work Tuesday and the rest will be back to work by Wednesday, union spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovalaske </PERSON> said. Machinists ratified the contract Monday during a three-hour meeting at <ORGANIZATION> Horicon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kovalaske </PERSON> said. The workers went on strike Oct. 1, one day after voting to reject the company's last offer. The plant, which produces lawn and garden equipment, has been idle since the strike began. The only other strike at the <LOCATION> Horicon </LOCATION> plant was in December 1958 when union members walked out for a week. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union is still on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, where it was joined by pilots and flight attendants starting March 4. The union also is continuing a walkout against aircraft maker <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> which began early this month.

 Negotiators for striking Machinists and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> resumed face-to-face negotiations today in an attempt to end the union's 27-day walkout. Federal mediator <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> brought both sides together after talking separately Sunday with negotiators for the company and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said he wants to keep both sides talking until an agreement is reached, `` but we'll see once they get here.'' Neither side, however, has changed its stance, with the union saying it wants more money out of the prosperous aerospace company and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> saying it's offered all it will. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said he could not talk about issues in the strike. He said Sunday's talks simply involved negotiators redefining their positions to him and setting up terms of today's discussions. The negotiations are the first since an effort by <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> to restart the talks failed Oct. 18. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said there was no specific item that got the two sides talking again, other than his decision it was time for negotiations to resume. `` <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> is a professional. He knows how to read the climate and when it's time to get the two sides together,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>. Some 57,800 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union are on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> nationwide in the walkout that began Oct. 4. `` It is appropriate for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the union to resume negotiations at this point to hear each other's position across the bargaining table,'' chief <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> negotiator <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McKean </PERSON> said late Sunday in a statement. `` Beyond that, I can not speculate on the direction, timing or ultimate outcome of the negotiations.'' `` This round of bargaining will hopefully lead to a settlement, but you have to be at the table to discuss the issues before you agree on them,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday night. Of the money issue, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said succinctly, `` They got it, we want it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said today that its net earnings for the quarter ending Sept. 30 were $ 242 million, or $ 1.05 a share, on revenue of $ 6.36 billion, compared with profits of $ 144 million, or 63 cents a share, on revenue of $ 3.72 billion a year earlier. For the first nine months of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had net earnings of $ 598 million, or $ 2.60 a share, on revenue of $ 15.43 billion, compared with earnings of $ 440 million, or $ 1.92 a share, on revenue of $ 12.09 billion. The third-quarter figures do n't show effects from the strike, but <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> warned today that the walkout would seriously hurt sales and earnings the rest of the year. The strike began after machinists overwhelmingly rejected <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s three-year contract offer that included annual pay raises of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent and bonuses of 8 percent in the first year and 3 percent in the second. The offer also had cost-of-living increases to virtually cover inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime from 200 to 160 hours per quarter and higher benefits. Machinists represent 43,300 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, 12,000 in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and a few hundred others in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and other states. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which employs 164,000 workers worldwide and about 106,000 in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, has kept its plants open and delivered 15 commercial jets since the strike began. Machinists last week collected the first of their $ 100-a-week strike payments. Health insurance for strikers expires this Wednesday, though employees can extend the coverage by paying premiums themselves. Last Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to reorganize its military and aerospace business to reduce losses and cut overhead. The changes primarily involve redrawing managment assignments with little change in job assignments or employment level at any plants. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said the decision was unrelated to the strike. The jets <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has delivered during the strike were all virtually completed before the walkout began. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has received orders for 807 commercial jets valued at $ 43 billion.

 Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed slightly lower Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as the corn and soybean markets succumbed to harvest pressure and pulled wheat prices down as well. The selling mainly reflected a perception that mild, dry weather allowed harvesting of corn and soybeans to continue at a rapid pace over the weekend, analysts said.

But most of the Midwestern crops have already been gathered and traders are increasingly turning their attention to export demand, which remained slack on Monday. The soybean market also was pressured lower by expectations that a large number of delivery notices will be posted against the November soybean contract on Tuesday, the first day for traders to declare their intentions to deliver soybeans against the contract.

 Two more Wall Street brokerages said Monday they would limit their program trading, joining other major firms that have backed away from the strategy under pressure following the recent stock market volatility. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said that effective immediately it would not execute index arbitrage for its clients. <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it had ceased index arbitrage for its own accounts but would continue using the strategy for its customers. The announcements followed similar moves by large brokerages last week. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, two of the biggest users of program trading, said they would stop using index arbitrage to trade for their own accounts; <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stopped using all forms of the strategy. Index arbitrage is a computerized trading strategy aimed at profiting on brief and minute differences between prices of stocks and stock-index futures, which are traded on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures exchanges. The trading tactic, in which millions of shares can be bought or sold in seconds, often is geared to make short-term profits during excitable markets. Critics say it can accentuate market movements, leading to sharp price swings such as the 190-point drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average on Oct. 13. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> halted index arbitrage for its own account nearly two years ago following the Black Monday stock market crash, which critics said was worsened by program trading. In Monday's statement, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON> said `` the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy.'' But they conceded that `` index arbitrage has been clearly identified in the investing public's mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatilty.'' <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> would stop executing such trades until the firm is `` satisfied that effective controls are in place,'' the statement read. <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> was the third most active index arbitrage firm during September, trading 34.6 million shares with the strategy during the month, while <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> ranked seventh with 12.8 million shares, according to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> led all firms with volume of 53.1 million shares. The brokerage houses have come under considerable pressure to eliminate the strategy. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, two major institutional investors, said they would no longer buy or sell stock through brokerages that conduct index arbitrage. <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, followed suit Friday. On Monday, the investment management firm <ORGANIZATION> Neuberger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> took out a full-page <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> advertisement imploring: `` Stop the numbers racket on Wall Street.'' The ad urged investors to voice their concerns in writing to <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. According to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> figures, program trading of all kinds accounted for a record 13.8 percent of average daily volume in September, the most since the exchange began keeping such figures in July 1988.

 The stock market pulled out of last week's slide, but could n't mount much of a rally in a quiet session Monday The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 92.42 last week, recovered 6.76 to 2,603.48. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 684 up, 774 down and 482 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 126.63 million shares, down from 170.33 million Friday and the lightest total in three weeks. Analysts said the market got some benefit from `` bargain hunting'' by traders attracted to stocks that have been hit by selling this month. They also noted hopes for evidence in the next few days that the economy was maintaining a moderate pace of growth, despite a recent barrage of disappointing corporate earnings reports. The government is due to report Tuesday on the index of leading economic indicators for September. Advance estimates call for the index, which is designed to function as a kind of economic crystal ball, to show a modest increase. However, concern has spread on Wall Street lately that corporate earnings will be disappointing for some time to come, even if the economy is n't headed for a full-fledged recession. The profileration of unpleasant surprises in third-quarter earnings reports issued to date `` is in stark contrast to the experience of 1987, 1988 and early 1989,'' noted <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` During that period, persistently rising profit expectations provided support to rising stock prices.'' Among actively traded blue chips, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> gained -RCB- to 42 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> rose -RRB- to 54; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> lost -RRB- to 99 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was down | at 45 -LRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 to 15 \ in active trading after dropping -RCB- on Friday Last week the company reported a third-quarter loss that included charges for restructuring. <ORGANIZATION> Nashua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> jumped 4 -LCB- to 33 -LCB-. Late Friday the company said <ORGANIZATION> Reiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> B.V. </ORGANIZATION> was seeking regulatory approval to buy more than $ 15 million of <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> stock <ORGANIZATION> Unum </ORGANIZATION>, which reported higher quarterly profits, climbed 2 to 43. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 150.75 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 3.75 billion, or 0.11 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks slipped .01 to 185.59. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index dipped .06 to 382.10, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up .01 at 335.07. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped 1.39 to 451.37. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 368.87, down 1.14.

<TEXT>
 The dollar was mixed against the major foreign currencies Monday while the British pound advanced for the first time since last week's political upheaval in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Gold prices slipped in domestic trading after rising overseas. There was no news to affect currency dealings, and analysts said investors spent the day squaring their positions following the pound's sharp decline late last week. Sterling chalked up its first gains since Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> resigned last Thursday night and caught many traders by surprise. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, an analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said sterling's rise reflected short-covering, the buying of dollars to fulfill previous agreements to sell them. The pound rose to $ 1.5825 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from late Friday's $ 1.5795, after closing earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 1.5785, up from $ 1.5750 Friday Some dealers warned, however, that sentiment toward sterling remained bearish. `` You're bucking the trend if you try to take the pound higher right now,'' said a corporate dealer at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` I'm not convinced the pound's fall has stopped.'' Overseas dealers said trading was lackluster as dealers waited for fresh economic news later in the week. Traders said they did not expect the dollar to move far away from its current levels this week unless Tuesday's release of the September Index of Leading Economic Indicators or Friday's unemployment report provided some surprises Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8340 West German marks, up from 1.8295; 1.6050 Swiss Francs, up from 1.6005; 6.2265 French francs, up from 6.2150; 1,346.00 Italian lire, down from 1,348.00; and 1.1735 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1747 The dollar rose to 141.90 Japanese yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from late Friday's 141.75. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 142.17 yen from 142.75 Friday, and in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar declined to 142.05 yen. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8360 West German marks, up from 1.8300; 1.6065 Swiss francs, up from 1.6005; 6.2325 French francs, up from 6.2190; 2.0727 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0820; 1,348.00 Italian lire, up from 1,342.00; and 1.1747 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1746 Gold edged lower in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> following gains in foreign trading. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid of $ 376.65 for a troy ounce of gold, down from late Friday's $ 377.25. Earlier, a troy ounce of gold fell 70 cents to close at $ 377.80 on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 376.75 a troy ounce, up from $ 374.25 bid late Friday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the metal rose to a closing bid of $ 376.75, up from $ 373 bid late Friday, and in earlier <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> trading, gold rose $ 1.45 to close at a bid $ 378.75. Silver prices also were mixed.

<HEAD>Miller Introducing Its First Non-Alcoholic Brew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday introduced its first non-alcoholic brew, a product it said was spurred by growing anti-drinking sentiment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also announced plans for a 12-week Super Bowl advertising campaign featuring two celebrity-coached teams battling on a football field over rival `` taste great'' and `` less filling'' claims for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> beer. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>'s brand non-alcohol brew will be introduced for sale nationwide Jan. 1 and will be backed by a national marketing effort but no test-marketing, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> officials said. Non-alcoholic beers have been popular in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for some time, and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brewers, including <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pabst </PERSON> and <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON>, already sell non-alcohol or low-alcohol brands <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> touts <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>'s as having a taste like real beer due to a new brewing process the company developed. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> experimented in 1984 with a low-alcohol beer, also called <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>'s, but the brew did not advance beyond test marketing. Annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of non-alcoholic beers is about a million barrels a year, compared with the national beer market of more than 182 million barrels. But the non-alcoholic segment is growing at the rate of 10 percent to 15 percent a year while the overall beer market has been stable, analysts said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishock </PERSON>, new products category director for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said growth in the non-alcoholic beer market prompted <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> to bring <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>'s out nationwide without test marketing. The new brew will have 74 calories per 12-ounce serving _ about half the calories of regular beer _ and will be sold in bottles, cans and kegs. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON>, publisher of the industry newsletter Beer Marketer's Insights, said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s introduction of a non-alcohol beer was not surprising in view of an anti-alcohol atmosphere he said prevailed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON> said non-alcoholic beers had not proven widely popular in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> largely because they lacked the taste of regular beer, and because brewers had found it difficult to brew a non-alcohol beer with real beer taste. <PERSON> Krishock </PERSON> said most brewers produced a non-alcoholic product by using a normal brewing cycle and then removing the alcohol along with the `` real beer'' taste. Under <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s new brewing process, when the yeast is added to the wort _ the end product of the barley-cooking process _ the temperature is kept low so that fermentation is slow and produces minimal alcohol, at the same time that the yeast contributes its taste to the brew. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said its Super Bowl ad campaign, which will begin Nov. 5, will feature 12 weeks of television, radio and print advertising and a consumer sweepstakes offering expense-paid trips to Super Bowl XXIV in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The celebrity teams will be coached by pro football Hall of Famer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Csonka </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>, of television's `` Cheers,'' while actor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moll </PERSON> of television's `` Night Court'' will referee Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> ran a Super Bowl ad campaign featuring battling teams of animated helmet-clad beer bottles pitting its Budweiser and Bud Light brands against each other.

 Oil futures prices drifted lower in moderate trading Monday led by weakness in the wholesale gasoline market. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for unleaded regular gasoline fell 1.21 cents to 53.41 cents a gallon. The contract gained nearly a penny on Friday amid reports about possible problems at a <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> refinery in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> confirmed late in the day that a catalytic cracking unit with an output of 60,000 barrels a day of gasoline had been closed for repairs The company said, however, that the closure would not seriously affect output. `` -LRB- Gasoline -RRB- gained Friday on news about the <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> refinery. It should n't have gained and today it came back off,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Weakness in the gasoline market dragged other oil prices lower, traders said. The December contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, closed at $ 19.72 a barrel, down 5 cents. January WTI fell 10 cents to $ 19.47 a barrel. No. 2 heating oil for November delivery settled 0.04 cent lower at 57.64 cents a gallon, while December heating oil rose 0.07 cent to end at 58.03 cents a gallon. Analysts said crude prices, which have weakened in recent days, could drift lower in advance of the Nov. 25 meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Traders have attributed the decline to concern about higher <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production in the face of slackening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand. Various estimates have put the cartel's total output at around 23 million barrels a day, well in excess of its official quota of 20.5 million barrels a day. And while various <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members have suggested that increasing worldwide demand supports the higher output, some analysts argue that world oil prices could weaken if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the largest consumer of oil, can not absorb some of the excess.

 Copper futures prices fell sharply Monday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, extending the market's two-week-old slide amid new selling prompted by a continued easing of supply fears On other futures markets Monday, precious metals retreated; pork bellies surged while livestock futures were mixed; oil futures fell; grains and soybeans slipped; and stock-index futures were narrowly mixed. Copper settled .30 cent to 3.35 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 1.128 a pound, its lowest price since Aug. 10. Copper traders began selling at the opening bell in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s report of a smaller-than-expected 550 metric ton decline in warehouse stocks of copper last week. The market had expected a drawdown of as much as 4,000 tons. The report reinforced perceptions that pressure on copper supplies is easing following the recent settlement of a two-month Canadian mine strike and the expected reopening of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest copper mine after a two-month shutdown. `` Two-thirds of the near-term production problems seem to have been resolved,'' said metals economist <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the Canadian and Mexican mines. A third major copper mine, in <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, has been shut down since mid-July due to terrorism in the area. The market appeared to ignore news of a potential new supply threat in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, where workers at two mines, two mills and a smelter operated by an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> affiliate took a strike vote Friday that could result in a strike as early as next Thursday, when their contract expires. The Chilean operation, known as <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disputada </ORGANIZATION>, produces about 115,000 metric tons of copper annually, less than any of the aforementioned three mines, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Torget </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Under Chilean law, a strike would be required next Monday if no agreement is reached by then, <PERSON> Torget </PERSON> said. But, he said, `` we think both sides are interested in an agreement.'' Gold and silver futures fell modestly on the Comex, but sustained most of the gains made last Thursday and Friday, when gold rose more than $ 9 an ounce. <PERSON> Demler </PERSON> said the gold market's refusal to sell off sharply could be construed as a bullish signal. But analyst <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> predicted gold would `` encounter some formidable resistance'' at about $ 383 a troy ounce in the December contract. Gold settled 40 cents to $ 1.20 lower with December at $ 380.80 a troy ounce; silver was 3.7 cents to 3.8 cents lower with December at $ 5.283 a troy ounce. Frozen pork-belly futures rallied strongly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on reports that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> had bought 200 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bellies for November delivery and was considering buying up to 800 tons more. A pork belly is the part of a hog from which bacon is made. Pork bellies settled 1.25 cents to 1.75 cents higher with February at 53.60 cents a pound; live cattle finished .25 cent lower to .13 cent higher with December at 74.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .15 cent higher with November at 82.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .42 cent lower to .05 cent higher with December at 45.75 cents a pound. Oil futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, paced by the November gasoline contract, which expires on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 26 cents lower with November at $ 18.34 a barrel; heating oil was .16 cent lower to .07 cent higher with November at 57.64 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.17 cents lower to .35 cent higher with November at 53.45 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures prices closed slightly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as the corn and soybean markets succumbed to harvest pressure, pulling wheat down as well. Wheat futures settled -LCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 3.96 -RCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 cents lower with December at $ 2.41 a bushel; oats were \ cent to -LCB- cent lower with December at $ 1.42 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents lower to 1 cent higher with November at $ 5.60 -LCB- a bushel. Stock-index futures were narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of the stocks in the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled unchanged at 337.20 points. Each point is worth $ 500.

 Federal protection for 30 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers' pensions could be at stake in a dispute the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed to resolve Monday. The justices said they will decide what authority the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a federal agency, has to order employers to revive scraped pension plans. A federal appeals court limited such authority by setting aside the agency's order that <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, restore three pension plans with unfunded liabilities of $ 2.3 billion. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Monday that the lower courts `` misunderstood and misapplied'' the agency's arguments in finding for <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>. By pursuing the matter, he said, <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> is trying to `` prevent future losses from companies that might want to copycat the LTV-type approach.'' Government lawyers say the ruling, if not overturned, could make the agency `` an open-ended source of industry bailouts'' and spark a financial crisis similar to the one facing the government's insurance program for the savings and loan industry The justices' decision is expected by next July. In other matters Monday, the court: _ Heard arguments over a challenge to the partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers _ Let stand rulings that blocked a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> agency from imposing mandatory blood testing for AIDS of employees who come into direct contact with the mentally retarded people the agency serves _ Left intact rulings that may let <LOCATION> Urbana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, ban as obscene five nationally distributed `` adult'' magazines generally not considered hard-core pornography _ Was urged during an oral argument session to strike down as `` taxation without representation'' a federal judge's order that doubled local property taxes to pay for racially desegregating <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, public schools The pensions case focuses on the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that protects the pension benefits of the 30 million Americans who participate in single-employer defined benefit pension plans. When a pension plan is ended with insufficient money to satisfy promised benefits, the federal agency becomes the pension plan's trustee, taking over its assets and liabilities The agency then pays all benefits workers had earned as of the date the pension plan ended. In fiscal year 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 324.7 million in insured benefits to 113,000 retirees who participated in 1,476 terminated pension plans. Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>, after filing for reorganization under federal bankruptcy law in 1986, advised the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> that they could not and would not fund the three pension plans they sponsored. The plans, which have about 100,000 participants, were terminated in 1987. In a deal with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> union, however, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to what government lawyers contend is a `` follow-on'' arrangement. Under it, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> agreed to make up any benefits lost to employees because of the pension plans' termination _ those benefits not covered by the federal pension insurance program The result was employees continued to receive the same benefits they did before the plans were terminated, and payment of unfunded pension liabilities shifted to the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> contends such arrangements are abusive, and the agency ordered <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> to reassume responsibility for the three pension plans.

 A state judge spared the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> from another hefty fine Monday to give negotiations mediated by former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> a chance to progress. <LOCATION> Russell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlothlin </PERSON> said the union violated his strike restrictions 84 times in August and September and said nearly half of the acts were violent. The most blatant act of defiance he cited occurred last month when 98 union members invaded <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s main preparation plant and occupied the building for four days. However, <PERSON> McGlothlin </PERSON>, who previously issued fines totaling $ 31 million for illegal strike activities directed at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>, said he wanted to avoid any action that could impede progress at the bargaining table. The judge said he would wait until Dec. 8 to decide whether to impose additional fines. `` The court feels there seems to be high hope'' for progress in contract talks, <PERSON> McGlothlin </PERSON> said in a courtroom filled with striking miners and supporters. `` It's important to the parties that Mr. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> and the negotiators for both sides have the best possible circumstances to work with.'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> last week appointed <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> as a `` super'' mediator in the strike. The walkout, involving <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,695 union workers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, began April 5 Previous talks conducted under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> produced virtually no progress. <PERSON> McGlothlin </PERSON> also said he wanted his postponement to encourage striking miners to put an end to violent acts undertaken to disrupt coal shipments and intimidate replacement workers. The judge said that for three weeks after the preparation plant takeover, virtually no violations of strike restrictions were reported. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratten </PERSON>, a member of the union's negotiating team, said he was surprised and pleased by <PERSON> McGlothlin </PERSON>'s decision. `` I think he's given the process a chance to work. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> said, `` If it helps end the violence, who can complain about that? Not me.'' <PERSON> Bratten </PERSON> said <PERSON> McGlothlin </PERSON>'s previous fines, stretching back to June, allowed <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> to stall in contract talks. `` They had a direct impact on <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s desire to negotiate in good faith. The state court placed economic pressure on the union.'' <PERSON> McGlothlin </PERSON> heard two days of testimony in a contempt of court hearing last week and said he wanted to wait until Monday to rule in order to review the evidence.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its third-quarter profits fell 19 percent due to escalating costs to produce oil and gas and lower refining and marketing results. For the three-month third period, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> oil, gas and coal company earned $ 79 million, or 67 cents a share, down from $ 97 million, or 84 cents a share, in the comparable 1988 quarter.

<HEAD>Iacocca: Chrysler Plant or Plants Likely To Close by End of 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least one of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 12 North American assembly plants will have to close by the end of next year and some projects may be delayed as the automaker wrestles with a smaller market, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, in an interview published in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, did n't say which plants would be closed, but speculation centers on the company's <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> car plant as being the most likely. That plant makes the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daytona </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> LeBaron Coupe and convertible. Last year, when the company renovated its <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, plant for <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acclaim </ORGANIZATION> production, it modified tooling to enable it to make the two LeBarons as well. `` You have got too much capacity chasing too few customers in the richest market in the world,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. `` It will only be solved one of two ways. The way we will probably have to do it is that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will have to close some plants. Period. `` Or there would be a trade bill, and we would shut our borders,'' he said. `` But we wo n't do that and I do n't advocate that.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plans to idle its <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION> assembly plant in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in March. The company already has closed plants in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they will deal with overcapacity by trimming overtime, which has been high in some <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> factories `` We definitely will have to close more than we have closed to date, which is a 100-year-old plant called <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. `` There is a plant or two that probably will be closed.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> inherited the plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, when it bought <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Besides the plant closing, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said some projects may be delayed, but that the company's new LH and LX car programs will continue. Cars derived from the two platforms will be introduced in the early 1990s. `` That one is not going to be deferred because it is in the heart of the market,'' he said, `` and we would like some strengthening there.'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> indicated that the No. 3 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car company may abandon parts of the automobile or truck market if it determines that it is n't profitable. `` I do n't think we can afford to be in every car and truck segment,'' he said. `` In this world market now, you can not go it alone and you can not be all things to all people. ... `` So we're going to have to continue to try to develop car niches that are profitable to us.''

<HEAD>Boeing Reports Strong 3rd Quarter Profits, But Says Strike Will Hurt</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, `Boeing released ...,' with talks ending for
day.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> enjoyed record third-quarter profits 68 percent higher than in the same period in 1988, but the jet builder warned Monday that a lingering strike by <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> will hurt badly the rest of the year. The company also said it is having `` substantial'' losses on some government and defense programs. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> released its earnings statement as its negotiators met with those of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union in an attempt to end the four-week-old strike. Six hours of talks produced only an agreement to meet again Tuesday. Federal mediator <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, who called Monday's session, said he hoped to keep the two sides at the table until a new contract offer can be worked out. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> said the higher profits for the quarter and first nine months were due mostly to higher sales volume and lower research, development and other new business costs for commercial aircraft and computing. But he said that performance was partially offset by losses and higher research and development costs for defense programs, and a higher effective federal tax rate. Net earnings for the quarter ending Sept. 30 were $ 242 million, or $ 1.05 a share, on revenue of $ 6.36 billion, compared with profits of $ 144 million, or 63 cents a share, on revenue of $ 3.72 billion a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> said both profits and sales for the most recent quarter were records for the company. For the first nine months of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s profits were $ 598 million, or $ 2.60 a share, on revenue of $ 15.43 billion, compared with net earnings of $ 440 million, or $ 1.92 a share, on revenue of $ 12.09 billion. `` While that looks good at first glance, closer inspection indicates our net profit was only 3.9 percent'' for the first nine months, <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> said. `` Our profit margin is approximately 1 percent less than the average of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing companies and we simply must do better to remain competitive.'' Union spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> read it differently: `` That falls into line with our contention that their profits indicate they should make a better offer to the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union.'' Stock analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s performance was about what they anticipated, although they took special note of the downbeat forecasts for defense work and strike effects. `` That's the first time I've seen any indication they feel there will be a severe impact on the fourth quarter,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` At the end of the second quarter, they mentioned matter of factly that the company's defense and space programs would not be profitable at the end of 1989,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Deatherage </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Now they're saying it's a significant loss. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> announced on Friday a major reorganization of its defense division. The third-quarter figures do n't show effects of the strike by about 57,800 union Machinists who walked out Oct. 4 after rejecting a 3-year contract offer. `` The strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union will have a serious adverse impact on fourth-quarter sales and earnings and on the company's cash and short-term investment position,'' <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> said in the earnings statement That was one of the strongest acknowledgments from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> about damages from the strike, which has severely slowed aircraft deliveries. When the strike began, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had hoped to deliver another 94 aircraft by the end of the year. So far, it has delivered only 15.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major Japanese real estate concern, announced Monday it will buy 51 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the private real estate and entertainment company controlled by descendants of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The $ 846 million cash purchase will give <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> majority control of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wakefield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> real estate firm and <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the landmark, 22-acre <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> development built by <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> confirmed media reports that it was seeking an outside investor to buy part of the company. The reports indicated that some <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> family members, who control the company through trusts, wanted more income from their investments. Most of the family members' inheritance is tied up in real estate and other corporate holdings. But the independent trust committee that manages the family's trusts said the money from the sale to <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> would be reinvested in other company operations <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, chairman of the trust committee, said one objective of the sale was to diversify the company's holdings, which are concentrated in real estate. `` Our agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> preserves the abiding commitment to <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which my father made more than 50 years ago, and which present generations of the family continue to feel,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said in a statement <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Voell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive, said the purchase of the 627,000 shares in the company by <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> `` ensures the company's ability to continue to invest in Rockefeller Center to enhance its stature as the most modern and prestigious commercial complex.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s board, its advisers and the trust committee considered other options, such as a recapitalization funded by debt, before they decided on the sale. Four years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> refinanced <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> by taking out a $ 1.3 bilion mortgage on some of the rentable space, then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real estate investment trust. The company also manages <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The Rockefeller family fortune was built by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and was estimated at $ 900 million by 1911. His son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, created five trusts for his children in 1934. Those trusts are the principal owners of <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, with descendants of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> the main beneficiaries. The Rockefeller Center complex includes the General Electric Building, formerly known as the RCA building, Radio City Music Hall and the Time-Life building. <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s other businesses include: <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Wakefield </LOCATION>, in which the company holds an 80 percent stake. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> is one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest real estate companies.
