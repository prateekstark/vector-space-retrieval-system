<HEAD>Elvis Costumes Fetch Top Dollar at Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A stage costume worn by <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> sold Wednesday at a rock' n'roll and film memorabilia auction for $ 43,700, a record price for a piece of the late singer's clothing, auctioneers said. Bidding was also fierce for another Presley costume, for a 1964 telegram from former Beatle <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> and for a four-foot wall thermometer featuring <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, officials said at <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> auction house. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> of the Hard Rock Cafe in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> bought `` Shooting Star,'' a suit Presley wore at a 1972 concert at Madison Square Garden in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the auctioneers said. Hard Rock cafes are decorated with rock music memorabilia. Commission costs raised the total purchase price of the costume to $ 48,050, a Phillips statement said. Former country music singer <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Velvet </PERSON> bought for $ 23,500 a Presley stage suit nicknamed `` Good Luck'' by the singer and worn on a 1972 tour of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` This makes six jump suits which were once worn by <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> which I now own,'' said <PERSON> Velvet </PERSON>, who plans to exhibit the outfit at an Elvis Presley museum he runs in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. The costumes were the highlights of 550 items on sale, said <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>, rock and pop memorabilia specialist for the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> auction house. `` They very rarely come up for auction,'' said <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>. `` Most of them are in Graceland,'' the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> mansion Presley owned before his death in 1977. It now is a museum. Former Beatle drummer <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> sent his telegram to a Dutch newspaper to apologize for pulling out of a Beatles tour of <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> because of tonsillitis. `` I'm very sorry I could n't come to <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> and hope to see all my <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> fans on the next trip. <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>,'' it said. It had been expected to fetch $ 336. But Stone bid against <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafe </ORGANIZATION> and won with an offer of $ 3,000. `` I bought it because I liked it,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. `` I know it was a lot to pay.'' Stone estimated he spent about $ 74,000 at Wednesday's auction. He said he will exhibit all his purchases. A private collector paid $ 7,700 for the bright-orange thermometer featuring <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> to promote her 1959 film `` Some Like It Hot.'' The collector was not identified. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said it had been expected to sell for $ 1,340. `` I think people go crazy for anything to do with <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> said. `` She's so in vogue right now.'' <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> said the auction raised $ 287,300, but had its disappointments _ including handwritten lyrics by <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> and stage clothing worn by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Six sets of singer and guitarist <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s lyrics were offered for auction, but only two lyric sheets for the songs `` I've Got A Fever'' and `` Cancel My Tomorrows,'' found buyers, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> said A shirt <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wore at the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' first concert after the group left the Motown label in 1976 sold for $ 1,680, about half the estimate, he said. Four glittery stage suits worn by the <ORGANIZATION> Osmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> on their 1975 European tour sold for a total of $ 4,370. Each suit was marked with the name of the brother who owned it: <PERSON> Donny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>.

 A face-off between demonstrators supporting and opposing <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> resulted in a dozen arrests Wednesday night outside a Republican fund-raiser where the Iran-Contra defendant appeared. Twelve anti-North demonstrators were taken into custody for disorderly conduct, Lt. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Martorano </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Waukesha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. He said two were also cited for resisting arrest and one for possession of a controlled substance. No injuries were reported By 10 p.m., most of those arrested were free on bail, he said, adding that they would face court dates in about two weeks. <PERSON> Martorano </PERSON> said most of the arrests involved demonstrators who were `` generally not adhering to rules set up out there for the protesters to follow.'' Police required the anti-North demonstrators to stay within a specific area preventing any intermingling of the two protest groups. Reporters at the scene said there were about 125 anti-North protesters and 60 pro-North demonstrators. <PERSON> Ardelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hough </PERSON> of <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, who described herself as an officer of the Women's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, contended the police rules and the arrests violated the protesters' constitutional rights of free speech and free assembly North, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, retired earlier this year as a lieutenant colonel after 20 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. He was among four people named in an indictment sought by a special prosecutor who investigated the sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and diversion of funds to aid rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

 A 3-pound <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> terrier survived a fall from a 12th-floor balcony and may be walking again by the end of the week, a veterinarian says. `` It's really a lucky dog,'' said veterinarian <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who treated the tan and black dog named <PERSON> Missy </PERSON>. `` I did n't think she was going to make it, to tell you the truth ... it's a definite miracle.''

Her owners, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON>, said strong winds created a vacuum that sucked the small dog through a 5-inch-wide opening in a guard rail. <PERSON> Missy </PERSON> landed in a sandy area, just missing a brick walkway and an air conditioner.

<TEXT>
 An American tourist accused of terrorism left <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, on Tuesday hours after she was released from jail for the second time. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, 40, a native of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, had been imprisoned for nearly five months on charges of taking part in an attack by guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement in which two people were killed. A <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> court cleared her on April 26 but she was rearrested on the same charges Aug. 2 and was held in jail until Monday night. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> issued a brief statement Tuesday expressing approval that she was released. But her departure entered a tense hour at <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s international airport when the embassy sent word that <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> was refusing to allow her to travel anywhere but to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, her lawyers said. Attorney <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Burneo </PERSON> said the embassy and former <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrantes </PERSON> made phone calls to Peruvian officials `` at the highest levels'' to gain final approval for her departure. About 20 friends and journalists witnessed her departure at 5:15 p.m. aboard a Soviet Aeroflot flight for <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>. `` My name is cleared. I feel relieved,'' she said. Police first arrested her Dec. 5 in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> state, 225 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, while she was on a trip through <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> as a tourist. She was charged with taking part in a guerrilla attack in August 1987 in <LOCATION> Vilcashuaman </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> in which two government employees were slain. Ms. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> was released from jail after a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> court cleared her of the charges. Her attorneys and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said two survivors of the <LOCATION> Vilcashuaman </LOCATION> attack testified she was not among the assailants. Other witnesses said she was in <LOCATION> Puquio </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Vilcashuaman </LOCATION>, when the attack occurred. <ORGANIZATION> Lima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the ruling on July 13 and Ms. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> began making arrangements to leave <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. She was rearrested on an outstanding warrant stemming from the <LOCATION> Vilcashuaman </LOCATION> attack when she appeared at a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> police station on Aug. 2 to get approval to depart. She spent the next three weeks in jail as her attorneys fought to prevent her transfer to Cangallo, the province in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> state where <LOCATION> Vilcashuaman </LOCATION> is located. Her release came after an <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> court ruled Monday that she could not be tried twice for the same crime, <PERSON> Burneo </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Mcnamara </PERSON> said she plans to go to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and meet friends before seeking a job teaching English `` somewhere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' She reiterated her innocence to reporters Tuesday. She has frequently disavowed any ties with the Shining Path.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s trouble-plagued schools for six months, faces the start of his first full school year and has no glib, instant answers for problems decades in the making Asked in a lengthy interview what his chief accomplishments have been so far, the former superintendent of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>'s schools answered without apology: `` None.'' `` I did n't rush to judgment because I thought: Who are you to come in, to be invited into somebody's home, and decide what's wrong with the home But I do believe I'm responsible starting this school year,'' he said. For Green, whose quiet, methodical speech belies a steely core, it's the little things, the symbols, that will lead to big changes. This month, for example, he conducted the first-ever count of people working for the central board, a bureaucracy almost legendary for its inscrutability. The answer: 6,447. Next, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> wanted to show teachers he really cares about their professional status. He chose a symbol, giving each of the city's 974 schools until December to rid themselves of the time clocks that teachers have had to punch As for the biggest issues _ the dropout rate, the racial polarization, the sorry state of education for the handicapped, the taming of custodians who had grown all-powerful in many schools _ Green pleads with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkers </LOCATION> not to expect real solutions for years. Here are highlights of the interview: Q: Now that six months have passed, do you ever wonder what you've gotten yourself into? Are you surprised or shocked at what you've found here? A: No. I think it's a very unusual and special opportunity to affect the lives of nearly one million students. The common theme throughout <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, despite the dropout rate, despite the fact that we have had students with weapons in school, is an underlying feeling that we've got to make the schools work by working together. And that's a very motivating thing for me. Q: What would you list as your key accomplishments so far? A: None. I have n't accomplished anything. I've come to set the stage for making education work. I'm working toward ... making this the most successful school year that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has had. Q: Let's talk about some of the toughest problems you'll face. The city has handled education for the handicapped so badly that it's been under federal court monitoring for a decade. When do you think things will improve enough for that to end? A: Maybe five years. Anybody looking for an instant response to that will be disappointed. There are too many complicating factors, particularly the numbers of children who are non-English speaking. The reason litigation builds up over time is that there was a loss of communication and trust. It's going to take time with those advocacy groups and parent groups to restore the trust that was, or create what never was. Q: The city's school minority population stands at over 80 percent. Only a handful of high schools have white enrollments above 50 percent. Is racial integration now an impossible dream for most of our schoolchildren? A: It seems to me we're a country very dependent on diversity, a society that stands for access, not exception. The goals of integration ought to be widely clung to ... The majority of students in this city, unless they are selected by special schools, will very unlikely have the opportunity for an integrated experience. Students can not travel the long distances required in this large and complex city. In order to have large scale racial integration, you need large-scale racial balance in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. You do n't have it. Q: Let's talk about the status of school reform here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. One idea you became famous for in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> was your program of testing kindergarten children and holding back those who flunk. You've raised the possibility of starting that in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> despite warnings by many educators that such testing is inappropriate for children that age. Are you still pushing for this? A: What I have observed in American education in my nearly 30 years is that those systems relying on social promotion missed the mark. I do n't care if students are retained or not. What I care about is that we know how well they are performing so that they do n't become victims of the system If you do n't have some process by which ... a teacher you can look a parent in the eye and say, you're child is really ready, you're almost rendering some children to academic failure the rest of their life. The gap seems to be particularly damaging for minority students, and minority males to be specific. I'm prepared to continue our discussion. It really does not matter to me that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> adopt the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> model about retention. But teachers do have to be accountable for what they are willing to recommend to the next level of teacher. Otherwise it's not going to work Q: You said in your inaugural address last March that schools should stop making teachers punch time clocks. Will they still be doing so in September? A: I said in my inaugural comments that I thought it was unprofessional. Some people have replied, you ca n't trust anybody. People see others not doing what they should, the guy next door who went off to watch the <ORGANIZATION> Knicks </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>. But I still say they're professionals. So I am putting out a memo asking principals to work with their staffs to determine how they can account for attendance in the absence of time clocks, or whether they want to sustain them. They will make the decision building-by-building, and no one will ever be able to say they did n't have a chance to participate in a work related issue that I think is symbolic. Q: Your style seems to be low-key, methodical, deliberate, in a town that's brash and brassy. Do you worry that your lower profile makes people wonder, what's this guy doing? Is that a problem in this town? A: I have no idea. My mission, it may sound altruistic, is to serve children. I hope to represent the school community in the best possible way. My eye is on that prize. For those who want a daily performance report, they're not going to find me a very willing participant. I do n't think it has anything with education. I do n't think it has anything to do with children.

<HEAD>Assembly Strengthens Infectious Waste Dump Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state Assembly Tuesday night gave final legislative approval to a measure that would stiffen penalties for those caught illegally dumping infectious medical wastes. The bill, which passed 142-0 without debate, also provides more money for enforcement and needs only the signature of Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to become law. It's designed to stem the flow of medical debris that washed ashore on several <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beaches, closing them to bathers on some of the hottest days of the year. The bill would provide penalties of up to 10 years in jail and fines of $ 100,000 for people convicted of disposing of `` red bag'' wastes, so named because the waste is required to be thrown out in specially marked containers. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state will also provide $ 2 million to add new illegal dumping patrols. State Environmental Conservation Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorling </PERSON> concluded last month that there was no single source for the waste washing up on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> beaches. He said the waste may have come through the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> sanitation system, through illegal dumping, casual dumping from boats or some combination of all of these.

<TEXT>
 After years of exile and scorn for the ballot box, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s leftist political parties allied with Marxist-led guerrillas are preparing to compete in next year's presidential election `` Elections here between 1982 and now have been part of a plan designed principally to counter action of the guerrilla army, part of a counter-insurgency project,'' said <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON>, organization secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. `` It could therefore be argued that we are now lending our support for that same project, and that we're contradicting ourselves,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON> added, more `` political space has opened up'' since the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and four other <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries signed a peace plan Aug. 7, 1987. `` We want to take maximum advantage of that political opening, even though we are certain that doing political work in those spaces is like swimming in a river full of crocodiles,'' he said in an interview in his party's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> headquarters. The regional plan has not ended guerrilla conflicts in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, but it has contributed to broadening the range of political expression in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, has been allied since 1981 with the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla organization known as the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> that has been fighting the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government for eight years. Leaders of the political front who had left in the early 1980s because of rampant rightist death squads began returning to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in November and are still coming. Among them are <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>'s party is a left-leaning offshoot of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who sat on military-civilian juntas in 1980-82 and has governed since 1984. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has cancer and his doctors say it is terminal. The Oqueli's Revolutionay Movement, the Social Christians and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have formed the Democratic Convergence. <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON>'s group announced in July its participation, via the Convergence, in the presidential election set for March. Although the electoral front has yet to announce its participation officially, it is already hard at work launching a campaign. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said the Convergence's activity `` is generating a political alternative capable of attracting ample sectors of the population that have been left without alternative.'' `` We're also contributing little by little to overcoming people's fear, because of past repression, of participating in politics,'' he said. The leftists do not harbor illusions of an electoral victory. `` We are not taking part strictly for the votes, rather we're mounting a historical project that transcends election day,'' said <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON> The main plank in the leftist platform is a negotiated end to the war. The government has rejected two such proposals by the insurgents so far this year. `` The country's principal problem is the war,'' <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON> said. `` If the armed conflict is not resolved, we will not be able to resolve the economic, social and political problems _ health, housing, nutrition, employment. So we're telling the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people that a solution to the war is necessary, and for us that solution is a negotiated political one.'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s position is that the guerrillas lay down their arms before talks can begin, but the rebels say that would be tantamount to surrender. The guerrillas imposed a nationwide transport ban during legislative and municipal elections in March to underscore their characterization of them as `` a farce.'' The prospect of watching their political allies take part in similar elections next year is thought to be a difficult pill for them to swallow. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> does n't have to either approve or disapprove of our participation,'' said <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON>. `` They simply must respect it, as we respect their principal means of struggle.'' He said political and military revolutionary leaders met in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in mid-July to discuss electoral participation. `` Our position and our objectives were fully understood -LRB- by the guerrillas. -RRB-'' he said. The Convergence will go up against an incumbent party shattered by infighting and deteriorated by the exercise of power during years of crisis. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s promises of peace and increased well-being have gone unfulfilled. The Republican Nationalist Alliance, the main rightist opposition, is running on the full head of steam produced by its victories in March. The party, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, gained control of the legislature and two thirds of municipalities nationwide. The leftist political front could face its most difficult dilemma if no candidate in March receives more than 50 percent of the vote. That would require a second round with the top two finishers in the running. Most observers doubt either the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> will receive a majority in the first round. If the Convergence obtains around 10 percent of the vote, which is considered feasible, it could decide the outcome by casting its lot with one of the two major parties. <PERSON> Oqueli </PERSON> said he believes abstention would be advisable in a second round. `` If we tie ourselves to the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, and they continue as they have been, we dirty our future,'' he said. `` And <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> represents the oligarchic past that brought the country to where it is now.''

 More than a month of demonstrations by an anti-abortion group trying to close local clinics have worn out the city's welcome mat, and Southern hospitality is being withdrawn. During and just after the Democratic National Convention, police carried anti-abortion protesters to waiting jail buses. Now, more than 700 arrests and a dozen demonstrations later, they drag them. `` We're giving them the opportunity to walk the 10 feet to the bus,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Denson </PERSON>. `` We are no longer extending certain courtesies,'' says Sgt. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pydrum </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The jails are getting crowded, although corrections officials say they can manage, even if some demonstrators have to bunk on cell floors. And the cost of protecting the clinics and of arresting and holding the protesters has shot past $ 250,000. Operation Rescue, a New York-based anti-abortion group, kicked off the protests July 19, the second day of the convention, when scores of activists who were not carrying identification tried to block access to a clinic where abortions and other procedures are performed. Those arrested refused to give their names, identifying themselves as Baby <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> or Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> to show solidarity with the fetuses. Some remain jailed; others have been identified or have won their release by giving their names. Comrades keep coming. Authorities wo n't release those who refuse to give their names, saying they could not be sure the protesters would return for court dates. Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> rejected a request last week by 44 congressmen, including the entire <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> delegation, to release the prisoners. He said the protesters could go when they give their names, and noted that <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> pays $ 10,000 a week in police overtime because of the protests. It costs about $ 50 a day to keep a person in jail. The city's tactics in dealing with the activists have changed as the protests have dragged on. The convention expedient of releasing arrested protesters on recognizance bonds is history; authorities now require cash or a surety bond ranging from $ 300 to $ 2,000. About 300 demonstrators remain in city and <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jails, now mixed in with the general jail population instead of being kept apart. Some demonstrators are being charged with felony obstruction counts instead of misdemeanor trespassing. Vans taking protesters to the clinics have started getting traffic tickets. But leaders of Operation Rescue continue urging people to come, block entrances to clinics and get arrested. `` Our objective is to close the clinics,'' said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, an Operation Rescue spokesman who added that the group is opening a permanent office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` The effect is a heavy arrest load but we're not listing -LRB- overloading jails -RRB- as a main goal.'' He said about 50 of the 134 arrested in the first demonstration remain in jail, and some have vowed to stay 100 days. The most recent demonstration was Friday, when 40 were arrested. The seven clinics in the metropolitan area remain open, guarded by police, but <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> contends that does not mean defeat. `` Our objective is to save lives. Preventing people from going in -LRB- to the clinics -RRB- is the same thing. Whether it is open or not is a matter of words,'' he said. Lawsuits are pending against Operation Rescue in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Attorney <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> <PERSON> Hames </PERSON>, who represents some Atlanta-area clinics, said such a lawsuit is being considered in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, `` but it is not a priority. -LRB- The clinics -RRB- have not decided what to do. The focus has been on maintaining service.'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said Operation Rescue has no plans to stop the demonstrations as long as volunteers are willing to come to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and go to jail. He told of a businessman from <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, due in this week with a busload of 25 employees and bail money for them, of people calling promising to arrive weeks hence, saying they are planning vacation time and arranging for discount air fares. `` People from 39 states have been through the jail here,'' he said. `` Now I'm calling people in states we're missing. I just talked to a woman in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> who said they were sending down a van-load. That will be the 40th state.''

<TEXT>
 Neither public protest nor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure has budged Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and the Panamanian movement to oust the nation's de facto ruler appears mired in uncertainty and despair. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s political foes did not even draw much enthusiasm from a huge anti-government demonstration that accompanied the funeral Aug. 15 of a revered former president whom the military threw out of office three times. Tens of thousands of people marched 40 and 50 abreast in the funeral procession for <ORGANIZATION> Arnulfo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleman </PERSON>, a leader of the opposition alliance, discounted its significance. `` In the short and medium term, I doubt that it will mean much,'' he said. `` In the longer term, we may see some life put back into the movement or we may see it fractionalized. The thing is, <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> is gone but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s still here.'' Behind <PERSON> Aleman </PERSON>'s assessment was his concern, shared by other opposition leaders, that the death could split the Authentic Panamanian Party, which <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> founded and built into the country's largest opposition force `` There's no one of <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION>'s stature in the wings, but if his followers can unite around someone it would certainly strengthen the entire opposition movement,'' a Western diplomat said privately. `` If they do n't, the party is likely to be split into a number of competing factions and that would just muddy things up.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has weathered a 14-month-old opposition campaign to force him out as commander of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which include the armed forces and police. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and federal indictments on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering have had little visible impact on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s standing. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, the president <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> put into office, rebelled and tried to fire the general a few days after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictments were handed up in February. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> arranged for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which he controls, to dismiss <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> instead. In speeches, interviews and billboard advertisements, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says the government will hold a presidential election as planned in May 1989. The main questions are whether <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will seek the presidency and whether the opposition can unite long enough to defeat either the general or the candidate he chooses. Some opposition leaders speak of boycotting the election, but most do not see that as an option. Another diplomat said: `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions have n't driven <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out, it is doubtful they -LRB- <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB- will try a military solution and there's no one in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> who can singlehandedly carry the opposition banner. The people are being driven to despair. `` There are a lot of people out there who are against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ very easily the majority, I'd say _ but they feel abandoned by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and there's not one single opposition leader with whom they feel comfortable.'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, visited <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> two weeks ago. Opposition leaders who met him said he offered nothing new. One said, on condition his name not be used: `` I got the impression that nothing will happen until after the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- election, and then who knows what?'' Some observers had expected <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to announce his presidential candidacy Aug. 12, his fifth anniversary as commander of the Defense Forces. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dropped no hints at the celebration, however. Instead, he delivered another diatribe against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, accusing it of creating a crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to negate the 1977 treaties that turn the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 31, 1999. `` Many Panamanians wrongly thought that with the new treaties of 1977, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were beginning a permanent honeymoon, forgetting that for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a treaty is no more ... than a useful but ephemeral act,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> declared. On Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> rejected charges that its troops are harassing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel and called the accusations part of an effort to undermine the government. Its statement injected a note of sarcasm by saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who make such accusations `` must have the IQ of a 3-year-old Cro-Magnon.''

<HEAD>GOP Convention Pushes Network Ratings To Sag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Republican National Convention would have been the top four shows in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings last week if only one network had been covering it. With <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS casting about for news in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, however, the convention made only one appearance in the top 30 while millions of viewers deserted network television. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, which had the lowest-rated convention coverage, nearly won the week with a big surge on Sunday night. Its `` 60 Minutes'' and `` Murder, She Wrote,'' tied for first, and CBS' Sunday night movie, `` Outrage,'' came in fifth. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, however, held on to first place with an average 8.3 rating for the week that ended Sunday, followed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' 8.2 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 7.8. Each rating point represents 1 percent of the nation's 86.6 million homes with television. For the 48 weeks of the season, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s average is 14.6, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' 12.3 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 12.2. In combined ratings, each of the four nights of the GOP convention did better than the 15.6 rating for the top-rated `` 60 Minutes'' and `` Murder, She Wrote.'' Totals were 19.9 for Monday, 17.6 for Tuesday, 16.7 Wednesday and 20.9 on Thursday. The best any one network could do, hower, was <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 30th place finish for its Thursday night coverage. Because of the convention coverage, the three networks had only 47 percent of the television viewing audience last week, compared with 67 percent for the season. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the first night of the convention but <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> ran well ahead in the next three nights, averaging a 6.6 rating. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> followed with 6.4 while <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, whose best showing was a second-place tie on Wednesday night, averaged 5.7. During the Democratic convention, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> averaged 7.4, followed by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> at 6.9 and CBS 6.5. Though it ran a poor third in convention ratings, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> nonetheless won the evening news ratings last week with an average of 8.8. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was second at 8.7 and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> averaged 8.2. After `` 60 Minutes'' and `` Murder She Wrote,'' the rest of the top 10 was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show,'' `` Golden Girls,'' CBS' `` Outrage,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Different World,'' `` Amen,'' and `` <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>,'' and a tie between <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 227'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Sunday movie, `` Letting Go.

<TEXT>
 Political associates of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sat next to each other in a meeting room for a serious, non-partisan discussion of making the jump from candidate to president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Many of the participants in a day of quiet talk sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> had taken part in presidential transitions in the past, many of them by their own admission seriously flawed. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told the group of senior campaign officials, political appointees and career civil servants that the next president-elect will have just 73 days from election to inaugural, the shortest possible period. The president-elect of 1988 will, under the terms of a new law, have $ 3.5 million in federal fuding to pay for the staff, office space and office equipment needed to mount his transition in an orderly way, <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said, pointing out that none of the money will be available until after the election. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Albright </PERSON>, senior foreign policy adviser to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, said during Tuesday's meeting that efforts to put together a transition staff are at a `` very embryonic stage'' because `` he will be devoting all of his efforts to win.'' But she said that from a subject to which little attention was ever paid, transition planning `` has now become a whole cottage industry'' with its own set of specialists producing studies and reports and issuing critiques. Mrs. <PERSON> Albright </PERSON> was on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration when the transition to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency began `` I think there was a pretty good commitment to hand it over in good shape to the people coming in,'' she said. `` We had political differences with them, but there was also a sense of responsibility.'' In a sense, she said, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> already has laid the groundwork for a transition should he win, by reaching out to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and establishing a relationship with the institution and its leaders. `` People actually do learn from mistakes,'' she said, noting there is a sense among many Democrats that `` President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> came to town in 1976 not knowing very many of the locals,'' something that worked against him when he tried to get his program through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ifshin </PERSON>, who served as general counsel for the <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> for President campaign four years ago, said the transition is important because it can have three results: get the new president off to a fast start, establish the momentum that will prevent a primary challenge when he seeks re-election and help him `` get to a second term.'' <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> deputy campaign manager in 1976 and 1980 and director of policy coordination in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> 1980 transition, spoke at length of his experience in <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s transition in 1968. `` Beginning the day after the election, we realized little had been done to prepare us to take over the government,'' he said, describing how the transition office took over the 14th floor of the <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotel </PERSON> and was faced with the task of `` moving out the beds.'' `` No plans had been made for logistical support,'' <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> said. `` And nothing had been done on policy planning. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had thought it was necessary to concentrate totally on getting elected.'' By contrast, he said, the incoming <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> team was `` a model both campaigns should look at.'' He said its personnel operation was well organized and a team was in place immediately after the election `` to go into every department and agency.'' A plus, he said, `` was that the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration was absolutely first-rate to deal with. The president ordered that every kind of cooperation would be given.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuelner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, described that conservative think tank's support work for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> transition. Speaking of the transition's efforts to get a grip on <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy, <PERSON> Fuelner </PERSON> said: `` One of the great difficulties was coming up with specific questions. The problem was, they never volunteered the answers to a question if you did n't know enough to ask.'' `` We had to keep reminding ourselves that we were not the government,'' <PERSON> Fuelner </PERSON> said. `` Until that magic moment, someone else was in charge. `` And when that magic moment does occur, you have a sudden loss of institutional memory'' as the old office holders leave town to pursue other careers. <PERSON> Fuelner </PERSON> had advice he said would work well no matter who wins in November: `` Work hard on your transition team. But keep your transition efforts very low key, so all of your efforts really are focused on Nov. 8.''

<HEAD>Thornburgh Questions Last-Minute Meese Action Aimed at Congress</HEAD>

 Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> says he is concerned that a special prosecutor plan aimed at <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by his predecessor, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, is a `` cure where there is no disease.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday that he is taking a `` second look'' at an order <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> signed on his last day as attorney general that requires special investigations of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> suspected of criminal wrongdoing. `` I want to find out what the underlying premise was in the issuance of the order,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. The former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> governor, who was sworn in Aug. 12, arrived in the waning days of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to head a department that had been buffeted by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s tenure. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was the subject of a lengthy investigation by Independent Counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who declined to seek indictments but said in his final report that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` probably'' had broken ethics laws. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s final-day order for special prosecutors to investigate members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was widely viewed on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as a parting shot by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> at his critics there. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, 56, a former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division in the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration, said Tuesday that it is `` pretty well known that I see a very limited role for special prosecutors-independent counsels in the process of investigating and prosecuting criminal cases. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys and the department's office of public integrity, which investigates corruption of public officials, do a fine job pursuing allegations of criminal conduct, and prosecuting if necessary. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> established the public integrity office in the mid-1970s. `` I guess what I am curious about is what is being proposed ... a cure where there is no disease'' he said. `` I am taking what could be called fairly a second look at that order.'' While <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was attorney general, a number of high-ranking officials resigned, and a number expressed unhappiness with the attention <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was forced to give to <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigation. Asked how he planned to restore morale, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said: `` You lead by example, and I want to make it clear that my view of the department is one that requires an absolute fidelity to high standards of professional conduct and integrity in our operations ... the values and principles of any organization are transmitted from the top.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he will talk to an advisory group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys to see what they think of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s last-minute order on investigations of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The order requires that attorneys general appoint an independent counsel to investigate allegations of wrongdoing made against a senator or congressman. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> already could conduct such investigations on its own, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said his order was designed to ensure that legislators and top executive officials are treated equitably. The 1978 Ethics in Government Act allows executive-branch employees to be investigated by special prosecutors, a provision that was designed to eliminate possible conflicts of interest in which an administration would be responsible for investigating itself. No comparable conflicts exist when the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ part of the executive branch _ investigates members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who are part of the legislative branch. Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of a governmental affairs subcommittee, already had asked <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to rescind <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s order because it contained a drafting error and the public never got a chance to comment on it During the next five months, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he will `` take stock and make sure everything is shipshape'' in the department. He said the department will aggressively pursue the war on drugs and other criminal activity. Although he is a strong supporter of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he will not campaign for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and has no commitment that he will keep his job if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins in November. He refused to talk about partisan politics because of the sensitivity of his position. And he said he had no idea when the department's office of professional responsibility, which looks into the conduct of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> employees, will complete its own review of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s conduct to see if it met ethical standards. The ethics review began after <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> issued his report last month. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> concluded in his final report that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably broke conflict-of-interest and tax laws, but <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the report `` vindicated'' him.

 Several of the Democrats from last month's national convention still have n't left town `` Neither <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been claimed. I think <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s still there and I think Grits and <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> are still there, too,'' said <PERSON> K </PERSON> <PERSON> Thweatt </PERSON>, public relations manager for <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s Stone Mountain Park. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Grits and <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> are among the 11 donkeys the state park acquired for publicity purposes during the Democratic National Convention.

<HEAD>Report: Television Offers Unrealistic Image Of Teen Girls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Television programs fail to show teen-age girls taking the steps necessary to achieve productive lives, focusing instead on obsessions with shopping, grooming and dating, says a women's advocacy group. `` These images create the impression that one can magically jump from an adolescence of dating and shopping to a well-paid professional career,'' said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Steenland </PERSON>, author of a report, `` Growing Up In Prime Time.'' The study of more than 200 episodes of 19 network television programs featuring adolescent characters was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wider </ORGANIZATION> Opportunities for Women. The non-profit group seeks to improve women's status in the labor market. `` Week after week, viewers see teen-age girls with no visible skills, no favorite subjects in school, no discussion about college majors or vocational plans,'' Ms. <PERSON> Steenland </PERSON> said in prepared comments as the study was released Tuesday. `` TV's teen-age girls are portrayed as poised for professional careers and productive adulthoods without clues to the steps necessary to achieve those goals,'' the report said. The report found: _ Girls' looks are shown to count more than their brains Some episodes portray intelligent teen-age girls as social misfits. _ Adolescent girls, who outnumber their male counterparts on television, are more passive than male characters _ Weekly plots are lacking in serious conversations with parents, teachers or peers about school matters, academic interests, career goals or future plans _ Ninety-four percent of teen-age girls on television are middle-class or wealthy In reality, more than one-third of adolescent girls live in families with annual incomes of under $ 20,000. The study said some episodes featured well-liked, intelligent girls and teen-agers who linked their interests to career goals, but the report singled out an installment of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Mr. Belvedere'' for criticism. The episode involved a college fraternity's `` bowser ball'' to which pledges must invite the ugliest girls on campus. `` Throughout the ` Mr. <PERSON> Belvedere </PERSON>' episode, the smart girl is portrayed as clumsy, homely, unpopular, unsure of herself and desperate for a date,'' the report said. `` ... According to the show, the drunken advances of a boy who thinks they are ugly and dates them as a joke are preferable -LRB- to being alone -RRB-.''

 The sons of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> say no strings were pulled to ensure their entrance into the National Guard during the Vietnam War. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, son of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate, and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the son of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, discussed their military service Tuesday in response to the flap over whether family influence helped <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> join the Guard and avoid being drafted for combat in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The younger <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> were Guardsmen together at <ORGANIZATION> Ellington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Both said they applied to enter the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1968 when it was inevitable they would be called to serve in the military. But the two, who had known one another in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> before joining the same Guard unit, said they enlisted on their own without use of their fathers' influence. Their fathers have affirmed that position. Both men said in interviews that they signed up after personally contacting the commander of the fighter group they wanted to join at <LOCATION> Ellington </LOCATION>. Circumstances of joining the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> have become an issue in the case of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a youthful advocate of the Vietnam War who is now a hardliner on defense in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. During the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> era, entrance into the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was viewed by some as a way to avoid being drafted and sent to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has denied any such motivation. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s student deferment from the draft was about to expire in 1969 and he had been called for his pre-induction physical, an indication he was about to be drafted. Most of those drafted during the period were sent to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. A retired <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> official acknowledged Tuesday that he told the Guard personnel office to hold open a space for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> after receiving a call from a <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> family employee in 1969. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s son acknowledged it was inevitable they would have to serve in the military after they graduated from college, so they chose <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service. The younger <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 43, railed at a claim by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s father had rushed to get his son a spot in the National Guard when he learned of an opening. `` He was absolutely, categorically wrong,'' the son said. `` Shortly after I graduated, I went to a party with some of my friends and one of the people introduced me to Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Staudt </PERSON>, who was the commander of the 147th <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Staudt </PERSON> told him at a later meeting that because of his masters business degree, `` he could use someone like me'' for an accounting and finance officer. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he went home and discussed the matter with his father, a businessman at the time, and decided to enlist. He became a finance officer `` as luck would have it,'' serving `` past my six-year requirement,'' and achieving the rank of captain, he said. In the younger <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s case, the circumstances also involved talking to Staudt. `` It was obvious that somewhere I would have to serve and I was fully prepared to do so,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose father was a decorated fighter pilot in World War II. The 42-year-old son said he, too, wanted to be a pilot. `` I heard the National Guard was looking for pilots,'' he said. He called Staudt, who confirmed the unit did need new pilots. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he could not remember how he learned of the need for pilots or knew to call Staudt, but that ultimately he became the third of six new pilots who were selected in that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> unit. He said he passed the pilot training exam, then served 18 months on active duty, six months in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and another 12 months of pilot training in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> where he flew F102 fighters, then flew on a regular basis until 1973. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he supported the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> cause and he `` jumped at the opportunity'' to be a pilot, joining the Guard because he could not be assured a pilot job in the other military branches. `` I was going into the service one way or the other,'' he said. Some senior pilots from his unit did fly in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on a voluntary basis, he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s son said he was motivated to join the Guard partly because he had just finished graduate school. `` I felt, as I think all of us did in 1968, that it was inevitable that we would be drafted within six to nine months. I did n't worry about going to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. In general I supported the war effort. ... My concern was that the military had a history of mismatching a person's experience with the job that they got and I was afraid they were going to make me a clerk typist somewhere.''

 A <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans' group is criticizing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for voting against what the group says are the interests of former <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> servicemen. `` On a number of different occasions, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator has had a chance to show just how deep his fondness for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans goes, and in each case he's dropped the ball,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stout </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military record is under fire amid reports he used the influence of his powerful newspaper publishing family to join the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, shortly before he would have been eligible for the draft at the height of the Vietnam War. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s office released his military records Tuesday. The 47 pages of military records show that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> scored below average on journalism tests he took after working more than four years as a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> public affairs official. But the records do n't have any information about whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> used connections to join the Guard. The Vietnam Veterans of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Tuesday criticized <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s votes in the past two years on veterans-related issues, including his opposition to a bill making the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> a Cabinet-level department During an appearance Monday night before the Veterans of Foreign Wars, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also was criticized by some veterans for that same vote. When he introduced <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> VFW </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice commander-in-chief, was applauded when he said, `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, we applaud your stance on defense and foreign policy issues, but you and I still have some talking to do in the area of veterans legislation.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did a quick about-face on the issue, saying moments later, `` I'm sure that as I grow older that I will learn my youthful indiscretions of failing to vote for the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. I will recognize my mistake and it will turn out to be the greatest cabinet we have in our government _ no doubt about that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 84-11 passage on July 12 of the bill making the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> a Cabinet-level agency. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was one of the 11 opposition votes. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, voted for the bill. A day earlier, both <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> voted against legislation which would permit veterans to go to federal courts to challenge VA decisions, a right that veterans do n't now have. Veterans organizations have pushed for that right of judicial review. On Oct. 16, 1987, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voted with the minority in an unsuccessful attempt to close the 188 storefront counseling centers scattered around the nation for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected the closure on a 57-33 vote. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was one of the 33 minority votes, while <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> voted to keep the centers open. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> joined a unanimous 89-0 vote on May 8, 1987, when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill to continue indefinitely the GI bill, a sweeping measure which provides education benefits for veterans. Last Dec. 4, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> both again joined a unanimous 88-0 vote approving an increase in the disability rate for veterans and improved veterans benefits. Generally, the military records released Tuesday are routine papers, detailing immunizations and copies of orders mentioning <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s name. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> entered the guard May 19, 1969, six days before he was to graduate from <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and become eligible for the draft. He had been called for his pre-induction physical April 9, 1969, an indication he was likely to be drafted. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spent almost all his Guard career in the 120th Public Information Detachment. Most of his time was as a clerk-typist, although he also was rated as a senior information specialist. He also was trained as a welder, but he did not perform that task in the service. When <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was evaluated as public information specialist in July 1975, two months after he left the service, he scored 56 points on a written test, 19 points below the average score of 75, the records show. The written test included questions on seven military journalism categories. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> scored `` low'' in five of the seven and `` average'' in the other two. There were five possible scores, ranging from `` very low'' and `` low'' through `` average,'' `` high,'' and `` very high.'' The written test was one of three parts of the evaluation. The records do not detail the scores on the other two sections, but they indicate <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s overall rating was an 82. There was no explanation for the missing scores, nor was there an indication of how the 82 figure compared with scores for other Guard members.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> defeated a primary challenger Tuesday who labeled the five-term Democrat too liberal for his <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> district, while <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, voters decided whether to keep the city in the running for the 1994 Winter Olympics. One congressional primary contest was on the ballot in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and seven in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, including a five-person fight for the Democratic nomination in the district that is comprised largely of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>. In that race, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Glassco </PERSON>, 32, a former prosecutor and onetime aide to former Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigh </PERSON>, won without a runoff over four other Democrats seeking the right to challenge Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Inhofe </PERSON>, who was unopposed in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. <PERSON> Glassco </PERSON> said he was `` ecstatic'' with his success in his first run for public office. `` It means those of us who are mainstream, conservative Democrats are the majority party here,'' he said. He said he was confident that the `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats will be with us on Nov. 8.'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, who describes himself as a moderate not a liberal, said of his victory, `` It should put these labels to bed once and for all _ Oklahomans are tired of it.'' With 348 of 467 precincts reporting in <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>'s largely rural northeastern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> distrcit, the incumbent had 48,314 votes, or 69 percent, and state Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shurden </PERSON> had 21,730, or 31 percent. In the Republican race to challenge <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philips </LOCATION>, 50, director of business development for the <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>, led with 4,895 votes, or 53 percent, to 4,258, or 47 percent, for <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrier </PERSON>, 60, a rancher. As expected, incumbent Democratic Reps. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON> won re-nomination overwhelmingly, as did Republican Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, voters selected candidates for the state's lone congressional seat. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a Republican seeking his ninth term, and Democrat <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruenstein </PERSON>, a former state prosecutor making his first try for statewide office, were both expected to win their respective primaries handily. Voters in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> decided a ballot issue crucial to the city's bid for the 1994 Olympic Games _ whether the city government would agree to cover losses if the local Olympic organizing committee does not raise enough money to stage the games Passage of the Olympics measure would not assure selection of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> for the games, but defeat would effectively eliminate the city from the list of finalists when the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chooses the host city next month. The other finalists are in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. In 1985, <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> voters endorsed the Olympics bid by a 2-to-1 margin, but were not told that the city would have to sign a financial agreement. In July, a poll sanctioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is seeking to stage the games, showed voters evenly divided on financial guarantees.

 In <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'s 2nd District, the winner of the Democratic primary is heavily favored in the general election because no Republican has been elected from the district since 1920. <PERSON> Shurden </PERSON>, 47, cited <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>'s relatively high ratings from liberal groups and a vote against a federal death penalty for major drug traffickers. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> calls himself a moderate, particularly when compared with congressmen from other states. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, 37, gained national attention two years ago with his successful lawsuit to force changes in the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law. He refuses money from political action committees and has sought legislation banning advertising of cigarettes. When he was in the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shurden </PERSON> gained wide attention for winning passage of a bill calling for the castration of convicted sex offenders. The measure died in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. In the 3rd District, Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was unopposed for re-election in the Democratic primary and there was no one running in the Republican primary. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'s four other incumbent congressmen were also heavily favored in primary races.

<TEXT>
 New guidelines that set up a range of sentences for federal crimes were declared unconstitutional Tuesday by a federal appeals court _ the highest court to rule on the issue _ because of the role of judges on the commission that drafted the standards. `` By requiring judicial service on the commission, as well as by placing the commission in the judicial branch, the -LRB- 1984 sentencing -RRB- act breaches the wall of separation betweeen the judiciary and the two political branches,'' said the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in a 2-1 decision. `` It thereby threatens to squander the precious aura of judicial impartiality, to the ultimate detriment of the judiciary and the society it serves.'' The required placement of three federal judges on the seven-member sentencing commission violated the constitutional separation of powers and also interfered with the appearance of judicial impartiality by allowing the president to appoint and remove members, said the opinion by Judge <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON>. The guidelines, which took effect last November, recommend minimum and maximum sentences for each crime, and require the judge to state unusual circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the range. Federal judges throughout the nation have issued scores of conflicting rulings on constitutional challenges to the guidelines, mostly based on the same separation-of-powers issue. The 9th Circuit, which covers nine Western states, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marianas </LOCATION>, is the first appeals court to rule on the validity of the guidelines. While the ruling has effect only in the region, it can influence other circuit courts, but the issue is likely to be decided ultimately by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sentencing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> of the 4th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on the <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> radio talk show that he was disappointed with the ruling. But <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> added, `` We'll be having a definitive and final answer from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> real soon.'' He noted that the court has scheduled arguments on the issue Oct. 5 on a case that originated in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. The guidelines were challenged by public defenders, who were unhappy with provisions that lengthened sentences for many crimes and restricted judges' authority. `` We're very happy with the guidelines being thrown out,'' said <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, an assistant federal public defender in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We're just ecstatic that we do n't have to deal with this nightmare any more.'' But he said lawyers will be `` in some state of uncertainty'' in dealing with a number of recent cases, including some in which the guidelines helped individual defendants and others involving plea bargains based on the guidelines. The challenges, in two consolidated cases from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, wound up before an appellate panel that consisted of three appointees of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON>'s opinion was joined by Judge <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunetti </PERSON>; Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> dissented. <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON> said the commission violated the constitutional limit on the role of the judiciary because `` its function is political and not judicial in nature.'' He said the commission's detailed rules on sentences for each crime invade the executive and legislative policy-making roles in numerous ways: for example, it decided that sentences for white-collar crimes were too short, cut back sharply on the availability of probation and decided that all defendants except the poorest must pay fines. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, in dissent, said judges' participation in a commission that drafted sentencing guidelines did not overstep the boundaries of the judicial role or tarnish judicial impartiality. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had set overall sentencing policies and could properly leave their implementation to a commission that included judges. <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON>, however, also said presidential appointment and removal of commission members created `` a continuous and fairly significant entanglement between the judicial and executive branches of government'' and interfered with the `` aura of judicial impartiality.'' `` While we are confident that no federal judge would be swayed by such considerations, the tens of thousands of persons who litigate against the government in civil and criminal cases may legitimately be apprehensive about the fact that the president is able to dispense plums among the federal judges who will decide their cases,'' <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON> said. Although judges throughout <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history have accepted appointments on non-judicial commissions, <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON> said any law requiring a judge to serve on a commission that made political decisions was unconstitutional.

<TEXT>
 Jury selection has begun in the trial of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, the former carpet-cleaning whiz kid accused of bilking banks and investors out of more than $ 24 million through a securities fraud scheme. Jury candidates were given a questionnaire Tuesday asking about their knowledge of the widely publicized case, their ability to be fair and impartial and their willingness to serve on a trial expected to last three months. The 22-year-old <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who turned his after-school business into a $ 100 million carpet cleaning empire, has declared his innocence, and claims he was a victim of organized crime figures who manipulated him and his business affairs. A panel of 200 prospective jurors jammed the courtroom Tuesday as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tevrizian </PERSON> opened <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s trial by reading the 57-count indictment against him. It accuses <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> of securities fraud, credit card fraud and mail fraud. On trial with him is accountant <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON>, accused of taking a bribe to retract his warnings that <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s ZZZZ Best company was involved in fraud. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> was originally indicted with 12 others, 10 of whom have since pleaded guilty to various charges stemming from the alleged scheme. The main allegation against <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> is that he fabricated building renovation deals to defraud investors. His <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> actually did no renovation work, the indictment said. Investors who handed over millions of dollars were taken on tours of phony renovation sites, it charges. <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and sued <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> and four associates for more than $ 20 million in allegedly misappropriated funds.

 Cooler weather and relatively calm winds helped firefighters and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> regulars as they forged new battle lines against fires in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and Grand Teton national parks Tuesday. Firefighters also made progress against the <ORGANIZATION> Warm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> fire, which has destroyed more than a dozen structures southeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. Some of the 2,900 firefighters battling the blaze were scheduled to go home Tuesday and officials predicted containment by Wednesday evening. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, no significant rainfall has been reported in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> or Grand Teton since June, but temperatures dipped to the mid 30s early Tuesday, slowing the spread of 10 fires burning on about 375,000 acres. `` Overnight it -LRB- fire acreage -RRB- did n't seem to increase too much. The weather has been cooperative,'' <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON> said. Fire officials hoped temperatures would dip below freezing Tuesday night, which, combined with the trace of moisture in the air, could create frost that could slow the fires' advance. More than 1,200 soldiers flown in from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, have joined almost 4,000 firefighters who have spent weeks on the front lines of blazes all over the West. Half the soldiers were based at the <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>'s eastern border to keep the 156,502-acre Clover-Mist fire from burning into commercial stands of timber, while the others went to the 4,310-acre Hunter fire in Grand Teton National Park, said <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON>. Yellowstone officials reopened 41 miles of park roads, but the park's south entrance remained closed Tuesday, forcing visitors to travel about 150 miles to enter the park through its west entrance, <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON> said. The Grant Village complex, which includes a hotel, campground, visitor center and staff dormitories, also remained closed and officials restricted overnight backcountry use in all but the park's northeastern corner, she added. The stubborn Clover-Mist fire shifted to the east, away from the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> state line towns of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Silver Gate, but firefighters continued protecting the towns, <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON> said. In the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and Grand Teton National Park, the 6,000-acre <PERSON> Huck </PERSON> fire kept the Flagg Ranch and Rockefeller Memorial Parkway that links <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> to Grand Teton closed. The fire `` crowned,'' burning treetops on either side of the road, said fire information officer <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldapfel </PERSON>. In the forest's Teton Wilderness, the 46,750-acre Mink Creek fire continued to burn, but firefighters hoped to contain the 1,500-acre Emerald Lake fire by Thursday. Crews also hoped to contain the 9,000-acre Lost fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday night, he said. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, about 2,900 firefighters strengthened fire lines on the northeast and southeast flanks of the 37,000-acre Warm Springs Creek fire southeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, where it was burning actively. They also were putting out `` hot spots'' that could flare if winds pick up again. `` All in all, the fire is looking very good,'' fire information officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Krepps </PERSON> said. `` As long as we do n't have the wind, I think we're going to do OK.'' Firefighters have built more than 75 miles of lines around the two-week-old blaze, which destroyed 13 homes and several ranch buildings last week Firefighters made progress on fencing in two fires in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in southern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, while forest officials used helicopters to locate and warn backcountry hikers. About 70 firefighters were depending on natural barriers like lakes and rocky areas to halt the spread of the 24,000-acre <LOCATION> Storm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire about nine miles north of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of the Custer National Forest. Crews also were burning out timber stands in areas where the fire might escape. Fifteen miles to the west, about 500 firefighters sought to prevent the 27,000-acre Hellroaring Creek fire from spreading to the northeast, said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Gallatin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. In southeast <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, crews had constructed about 18 miles of lines around the 12,000-acre <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> fire and hoped to contain it by nightfall, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> of the Department of State Lands. The fire is sought of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. More than 300 firefighters who have helped battle blazes in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> have headed south to help out in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> states, and more were on their way Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> still classifies 31 fires as active, but by Tuesday, only one was manned. At the peak of the season, some 50 fires raged, and the service dispatched crews to one-third of them. Forest and brush fires broke out across <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> on Tuesday during record heat, including at least 20 fires caused by lightning, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The largest was a 200-acre fire at a logging operation 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Wallowa </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. An airplane crashed Tuesday afternoon in the <ORGANIZATION> Malheur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in east-central <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, killing three people and starting a forest fire, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. No information on the fire's size was available.

 A young computer whiz who tried to commit suicide after creditors and authorities seized his company has been charged with bilking six investors out of more than $ 500,000 to keep his business operating. A <LOCATION> Nofolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury handed up an indictment Tuesday against 24-year-old <PERSON> Tex </PERSON> <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>, charging him with 11 counts of felony larceny. He was scheduled to be arraigned today in <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. His attorney did not return telephone calls after business hours Tuesday. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>, who started his computer software firm at age 20 and lived lavishly, orchestrated `` financial deals where he promised investors substantial returns,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON>, a spokesman for the county district attorney. `` The money is still outstanding,'' the spokesman said. `` This -LRB- fraud -RRB- could stretch well beyond a million dollars.'' Some of the money was solicited to pay off other investors and bank notes, said McGorty. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> also is charged with using falsified documents to obtain bank loans for his Braintree-based company, <ORGANIZATION> Massdata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON> said. `` Why he was doing it is something that remains to come out. This is a very long and careful investigation and it continues,'' he said. The grand jury heard testimony from more than 50 witnesses over two months, <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON> said. Each of the 11 counts carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison or a $ 25,000 fine and two years in prison, <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, 50, fled <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> just before his company was closed in May and its assets seized. They were found a short time later when an employee at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> hotel called police to report a bloodied man wandering in the lobby. Police found <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>, who apparently had slashed his wrists. His mother, a former school lunchroom worker who was employed by <PERSON> Massdata </PERSON> as a clerk, was found lying injured in their room. Both were incoherent, police said. In the room, authorities found what they believed were suicide notes, said <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, police Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bovaird </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>, who had been charged with larceny of more than $ 250 after police received a complaint about his business dealings, was arrested as a fugitive. He bought his first computer at age 16 and, with the help of a mentor, rented office space to start his own software firm at age 20. The confidence he gained prompted the overweight young man to lose 115 pounds in less than two years. He quickly surrounded himself with symbols of success, including a $ 220,000 condominium, a $ 32,000 BMW and a $ 4,000, 50-inch TV.

 Help is at hand for British motorists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to keep them from getting stuck on the dual carriageway with a bad silencer and not a spanner in the boot. `` Driving in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>,'' a 32-page pamphlet written by two <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> journalists, aims to dispel some of the mystery of motoring the American way, and to protect this year's crop of self-driving British vacationers from death, speeding fines and big lawsuits. The pamphlet is another of those occasional reminders that the potential for Anglo-American misunderstanding is enormous, especially on the highways. They drive on opposite sides and have little in common other than that both use miles instead of kilometers. The dictionary alone takes up 1 -LCB- pages: a trunk is a boot; a hood is a bonnet; a wrench is a spanner; a muffler is a silencer; a stickshift is a gearshift, a fender is a bumper; gas is petrol; a trailer is a caravan; a divided highway is a dual carriageway and a beltway is a ring road. Some words do n't even have a British equivalent. Thus gridlock is translated laboriously as a `` traffic jam in all directions.'' The booklet is filled with surprises as to how much Britons do n't know about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> driving, such as toll roads, the fact that cars with automatic transmissions `` creep forward'' if the brake is n't pressed, and that speeding can mean fines. `` You are not in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where many drivers exceed the speed limit and appear to get away with it. You will not do so in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Every state has large numbers of patrol cars, with traffic police who know every trick.'' The pitfalls are not obvious ones, such as driving on the right, but some that `` are dangerously subtle,'' said co-author <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Symonds </PERSON>. `` There are some very confusing things, like ` no standing' or ` speed zone' which do n't mean a thing over here,'' he said in an interview. The booklet advises British motorists how much insurance to take on a rental car to avoid damage claims astronomically higher than anything at home. Under the heading `` The American Policeman,'' motorists are told: `` Treated with courtesy and respect, the American ` cop' will be polite, even friendly in a wary sort of way.

 The Little Mermaid, staring longingly out to sea from her rocky perch in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> harbor, was honored with a 21-gun salute and a laurel from the mayor as she turned 75. She has been beheaded, had an arm cut off, and suffered various other indignities, but the bronze statue created in honor of writer <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> was treated like royalty at Tuesday's celebration Mayor <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigekamp </PERSON> led the party, placing a wreath of flowers around the neck of `` Den <ORGANIZATION> Lille </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Havfrue </ORGANIZATION>,'' as she is known in Danish. Children of 40 nationalities from the <ORGANIZATION> Copenhagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> waved flags on the quay. Older visitors were offered free beer by the brewery that financed the statue in 1913. The mermaid is one of <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>'s most popular attractions, drawing about 500,000 visitors a year. Pouring rain kept Tuesday's crowd down to about 100 The statue, which sits on a small rock outcropping at the entrance to <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> harbor, is based on <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s tale of the daughter of the sea king who fell in love with a prince and was doomed to wait 300 years before she could turn human. She leans on one hand, her fish tail stretched behind her, and she is half turned toward the sea so visitors must strain to see the wistful look on her face. She has often been used as a symbol of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, and anti-nuclear activists have depicted her as a skeleton. Visitors often are surprised at her small stature _ about the size of a small girl _ and artists have debated her artistic value. The mermaid was beheaded in 1963 and a new head was cast from the original mold. The police department called on its homicide division to handle the case, even though the squad was dealing with 16 unsolved murders. The head was never recovered. Twenty years later, hooligans amputated an arm, which also was replaced. Grafitti and paint splotches are a recurring problem for city cleaners. She was created by <PERSON> Edvard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eriksen </PERSON>, who took the face of Danish ballerina <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> and modeled her upper body from his wife. <PERSON> Eriksen </PERSON>, who lived from 1867 to 1959, attached little artistic importance to the mermaid. He authorized the manufacture of about 50 half-sized replicas of his mermaid to be placed in public areas around the world, including <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Solvang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eriksen </PERSON>'s heirs reportedly earn royalties of about $ 750,000 a year on trinkets and souvenir models

<HEAD>Federal Guidelines Ruled Unconstitutional On Separation-Of-Powers
Grounds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeals court struck down new guidelines establishing a range of sentences for federal crimes, ruling the standards are unconstitutional because they were drafted by judges as a political act. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, the highest court to rule on the issue, said Tuesday that placing three federal judges on the seven-member sentencing commission violated constitutional separation of powers. In a 2-1 vote, the court decided the use of judges on the commission interfered with the `` aura of judicial impartiality'' by allowing the president to appoint and remove members, said the opinion by Judge <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may not, under our system of separated powers, require judges to serve on bodies that make political decisions,'' <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON> said. The decision affects only the region covered by the <ORGANIZATION> 9th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>, comprising nine Western states, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marianas </LOCATION>. However, the court is the nation's first on the appellate level to rule on the validity of the guidelines. Other federal judges nationwide have issued numerous conflicting rulings on challenges to the guidelines, mostly based on the separation-of-powers issue. The guidelines were challenged by public defenders, who were displeased with provisions that lengthened sentences for many crimes and restricted judges' authority. The chairman of the sentencing commission, Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> of the 4th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in Appeals in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he was disappointed by the ruling but added, `` We'll be having a definitive and final answer from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> real soon.'' <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, interviewed from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s syndicated radio talk show, said courts have decided about 200 cases based on validity of the sentencing guidelines, with the rulings about evenly divided. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled arguments on the issue for Oct. 5 in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, he said. Tuesday's ruling on two consolidated challenges from <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> said the commission violated the constitutional limit on the role of the judiciary because `` its function is political and not judicial in nature.'' <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON> said the commission had to make rules and policies having the force of law, `` tasks that only the legislative or executive branches, and not the judiciary, may constitutionally perform.'' The guidelines, which took effect in November, recommend minimum and maximum sentences for each crime, requiring the judge to state unusual circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the range. The appeals court also found invalid the 1984 sentencing law that created the <ORGANIZATION> Sentencing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and abolished parole in post-November 1987 cases. Such a ruling would restore the entire previous law, which generally gave judges wide-ranging sentencing discretion and provided for parole eligibility after one-third of a sentence. `` We're very happy with the guidelines being thrown out,'' said <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, an assistant federal public defender in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We're just ecstatic that we do n't have to deal with this nightmare any more.'' But he said lawyers will be `` in some state of uncertainty'' in dealing with many recent cases, including some where the guidelines helped individual defendants and others involving plea-bargains based on the guidelines. The status of parole is also unclear, he said. <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON> said the commission's detailed rules on sentences for each crime invade the executive and legislative policy-making roles in many ways. For example, it said sentences for white-collar crimes were too short, that all defendants except the poorest must pay fines. The commission also refrained from issuing any guidelines on the death penalty, he said. <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON> said the decision on the death penalty, a 4-3 vote of the commission, apparently resulted from a fear that controversy over the issue might prevent congressional approval of the guidelines. While the decision leaves the issue of capital punishment with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, it illustrates that `` the commission's work was indeed substantive and political, not procedural and impartial,'' he said. Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, in dissent, said judges' participation in a commission that drafted sentencing guidelines did not overstep the boundaries of the judicial role or tarnish judicial impartiality. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had set overall sentencing policies and could properly leave their implementation to a commission that included judges.

<TEXT>
 The director of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s AIDS program says he'll push for distribution of condoms in city jails even though the city prison board rejected the idea, saying it encouraged homosexuality. `` I am totally confident they will change their minds,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fair </PERSON>, director of AIDS programs for the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said, acknowledging that could take years. Meantime, <PERSON> Fair </PERSON> said, he will continue with an AIDS education program for prisoners that encourages abstention. The board Monday night rejected the distribution program by 3-2, with one abstention. Fair said the proposal would have made condoms available to inmates on request _ not, as some board members thought, through mass distribution. `` It makes me very sad,'' Fair said, noting that infected prisoners can spread the deadly disease after release from jail. `` Somebody is getting infected with AIDS.'' Board member <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON>, a lawyer who strongly opposes condom distribution, said the policy would have condoned homosexuality in jails. `` This jail is n't a sex factory,'' he said. `` It is n't a place to shoot up -LRB- drugs -RRB-. This is not proper conduct.'' During a two-hour discussion before the vote, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> urged approval of the policy, saying sexual activity was rampant in the city's jails. `` We are not condoning sexual activity,'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. `` We are saying it is taking place ... and the best protection against AIDS is using a condom.'' Board member <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornblum </PERSON>, who voted in favor of the distribution, said the issue will not disappear as long as acquired immune deficiency syndrome spreads. `` There will be more pressure to adopt condom distribution,'' <PERSON> Hornblum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hornblum </PERSON> said he knows of three other prison systems that have programs allowing distribution of condoms: in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Fair said eight prisoners in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> have been diagnosed as having AIDS and two prisoners have died from the disease while in custody. He said the number of prisoners infected with the AIDS virus is hard to estimate, but could be more than half of the 3,700 in custody.

<TEXT>
 A Swiss clinic that falsely claimed it had treated <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> with a `` youth serum'' of sheep cells has been ordered to pay the singer $ 450,000 in damages. `` It's excellent -LRB- that the court -RRB- has seen fit to vindicate the right of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen to protect his name and his reputation from avaricious appropriation, both here and abroad,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday upheld the September 1986 award against the Clinic La Prairie, rejecting the <LOCATION> Montreux </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, clinic's claim that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts lacked jurisdiction in the case. `` The clinic's employees fabricated an elaborate story calculated to link <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s name with their services,'' said Judge <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> in the 3-0 decision. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaman </PERSON>, a lawyer for the clinic, was unavailable for comment Tuesday, her office said. The dispute stemmed from an October 1984 article in the National Enquirer that said <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> had been treated at the clinic with a `` youth serum'' extracted from sheep cells intended to retard aging. But <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> had never even visited the clinic, although an attempt was made to recruit him as a patient, according to the court. While the clinic has no branches in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, it was trying to solicit business in the state when it planted the phony story in the tabloid in 1984, knowing that <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> lived in the state and the Enquirer circulated widely here, the court said. `` The clinic viewed the article as essentially a free advertisement that could reach between 5 million and 20 million people,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said in the 3-0 decision. The court said the Enquirer called the clinic the previous month asking if <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> had been a patient. The clinic's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrooman </PERSON>, then arranged a visit by an Enquirer reporter, who was given false statements by the clinic's president, medical director and others about <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s supposed visit and their personal contacts with him, the court said <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> sued the Enquirer and the clinic in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and later settled the case against the newspaper on undisclosed terms. The clinic said the court lacked jurisdiction and refused to take part in the trial; Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Real </PERSON>, after hearing <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s witnesses without a jury, awarded $ 350,000 for the value of the unauthorized use of his name, and $ 100,000 in punitive damages.

 An unemployed truck driver who served in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says he needed no special connections to secure a spot with the Guard. Retired Sgt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> says he dropped out of college, walked into a recruitment office and was offered a clerk-typist's position within 90 days He served side-by-side with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate. `` We entered the Guard the same rank and left the Guard the same rank,'' <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday night. `` And I was a nobody.'' Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> has been accused of using family connections to gain a position at the Guard's Headquarters Detachment, where he eventually worked in a public information unit that published news releases and a quarterly magazine, The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardsman </LOCATION>. `` If his family really had all this influence like everyone says, he would have been sent directly to officer's candidate school and come out a lieutenant or captain,'' <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> was an OK guy,'' <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> said. `` He did his job and I did mine. We washed dishes and washed jeeps together.'' Capt. <PERSON> Cathi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiger </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, confirmed the service was below its authorized strength when the then-22-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> signed up in May 1969. `` I can find no evidence that he was given special consideration and there was no need,'' <PERSON> Kiger </PERSON> said. `` Units that were not up to 100 percent strength could continue to recruit.'' But Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> said Tuesday that he received a call at that time regarding <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> from an editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, one of several newspapers published by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s maternal grandfather, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>. As a result of that call, <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> said he contacted the Guard's personnel office on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s behalf `` They said they had a couple of spaces,'' <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. `` I said hold one of them, there's a good guy coming over.'' <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> also said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> WTHR-TV </ORGANIZATION>, `` I could n't have done a thing ... if there had n't been a vacancy.'' Retired Col. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafferty </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was a prime candidate for the Guard based on his background and, at least in part, `` the way the system works.'' `` The unit Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> served in was a specialized unit. He could have been recruited very simply for the fact that he got a college degree, was in law school and had a newspaper background,'' said <PERSON> Rafferty </PERSON>, who was director of personnel for the adjutant general's staff in 1969. <PERSON> Rafferty </PERSON> acknowledged the recommendations of high-ranking officers carried some weight. `` If ... any of the generals called me and said they knew a man who would make a good Guardsman, I'd prick my ears because they only sent the highest quality young man,'' <PERSON> Rafferty </PERSON> said. `` That's the way the system worked. A 1969 Guard report indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was overextended in mid-1969, but a separate month-by-month breakdown made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday showed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s detachment had an authorized strength of 138 people in May 1969. Guard records show 134 men were in the unit at the end of April, 132 were serving in May _ when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joined _ and 133 men were enlisted in June.

 Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> to demand greater autonomy on the 49th anniversary of the pact that led to the Soviet takeover of their Baltic nations, activists said. Demonstrators waved the flags and sang the anthems of their former nations Tuesday and carried banners denouncing the secret agreement between the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the activists said. Some called for independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Three years after the Aug. 23, 1939 pact was reached, the Soviets moved into the three countries. `` This is another step toward Lithuanian independence,'' said <PERSON> Antanas </PERSON> <PERSON> Terleckas </PERSON>, a 60-year-old former political prisoner. He said he attended a rally of about 200,000 people at <LOCATION> Vingis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. According to reports from activists in the three republics, about 300,000 people demonstrated. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, estimated the total at 100,000. The demonstrations, unprecedented in size, were another indication of ferment in the Baltic republics under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of greater openness. Authorities gave permission for the demonstrations, and there were no reports of violence or arrests. Moscow-based foreign reporters who sought to cover the events were told by state-run agencies that no plane or train tickets or hotel accommodations were available. In <LOCATION> Kaunas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, an estimated 50,000 people gathered for a candlelight Roman Catholic Mass and procession, said <PERSON> Valdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Analauskas </PERSON>, correspondent in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> for the unofficial journal <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. At least 8,000 Estonians attended an outdoor rally and filled the <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> town hall for a panel discussion about <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repression of the Baltic states <PERSON> Ents </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsavilitis </PERSON>, a former political prisoner and a member of an unofficial environmental group, said he was among 30,000 to 40,000 people who demonstrated in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital. In a report from <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said `` several thousand'' people attended a meeting organized by informal political groups. It estimated the number of demonstrators at <LOCATION> Kaunas </LOCATION> as 10,000 and characterized the rallies as dedicated to condemning Stalinism. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reports on the day's activities were unusually detailed and speedy. <PERSON> Terleckas </PERSON> said many yellow, green and red flags of independent <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> were displayed in <LOCATION> Vingis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and that the three-hour gathering closed with the singing of the anthem of independent <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. Nationalist flags also were displayed in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kaunas </LOCATION>, and the outdoor gathering in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> ended with the Estonian anthem from pre-Soviet days, activists said. The 1939 agreement was a non-aggression pact that divided <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into German and Soviet spheres of influence. It is commonly called the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact after Foreign Ministers <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Molotov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribbentrop </PERSON>, who signed it. <PERSON> Tsavilitis </PERSON> said protesters in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> listened to more than a dozen speakers, including one who read a message of support from a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators. The <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> protesters carried the national flags of all three Baltic nations, he said. Protesters would have risked jail or fines not long ago for displaying the national flags, but officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> have eased up recently and some have expressed limited support greater autonomy. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartkevich </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> foreign minister, defended the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and declared that the Baltic states voluntarily joined the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to protect themselves from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>: `` There was one alternative, either union with the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>, or Hitlerite occupation and enslavement.'' Soviet officials say the pact was necessary to buy time to prepare for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s attack on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which occurred in 1941.

 Residents in this <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port where Solidarity was born stocked up on sugar, flour and bread, fearing shortages during <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst outbreak of labor unrest since 1981. `` I'm making sure I'm prepared,'' said one elderly woman. State-run media, in a campaign to erode public sympathy for the striking workers, on Tuesday quoted factory workers as blaming the strikers for long lines and shortages. `` We are scared by the lines in the stores,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted a textile worker in <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION> as saying. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> went through a very hard time in 1980 and we should have learned from this.'' Goods were in short supply during the tide of strikes eight years ago the spawned Solidarity, the only independent labor federation ever allowed in the Soviet bloc. Although there was no evidence of panic-buying in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> stores, residents said many people had rushed out to buy basic staples early Tuesday. But the stores were later restocked and even supplies of scarce commodities turned up on store shelves after a long absence, residents said. `` Now you can get cheese and ham,'' said a 20-year-old native of the country's largest port. `` They have been in short supply or missing for two months.'' The government pledged to increase distribution of staples and other goods during the strikes, which began Aug. 16 and seek higher wages and reinstatement of Solidarity, which was outlawed after being crushed in a December 1981 military crackdown. The government contends Solidarity activists are exploiting <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic woes and strikes are creating unnecessary hardships for citizens. Residents of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where strikes have idled the port and the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard, expressed surprise at the announcement Monday night by Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> empowering officials to impose curfews in areas hit hard by strikes. `` People were surprised by the curfew announcement because the media have only reported that there were rallies, and no strikes in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>,'' said one young resident. The radio quoted a worker who said he approved of <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s curfew order `` The only criticism I have is that it should have come earlier,'' the worker said. Strikers at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard, where Solidarity was founded, said the threat of curfews was meant to intimidate strikers and their families and scare the population into turning against them. `` We are not afraid,'' said an 18-year-old worker at the yard. Most doubted a curfew would be imposed in the city. `` We have thousands of tourists here,'' said a resident. `` How do you think a busload of German tourists is going to react when you tell them to be in by 9 p.m.?''

 The government will restrict to a border area Contra rebels who have in the past four months entered the country in a mass exodus from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the foreign minister said. The government is keeping the rebels near the Nicaraguan border to prevent instability in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said Tuesday. Contra officials have said more than 14,000 rebels and civilian supporters of their campaign against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> leaders entered <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in the past four months, seeking refuge and humanitarian aid distributed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was allowing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to reach the Contras as part of the peace plan signed last year by five Central American presidents. He said the Contras cross the frontier frequently because, under the plan, they were to be assigned to a zone in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that borders <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. But he acknowledged that some Contras were `` entering <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> as refugees, then later returning to their country to fight.'' Since 1981, the U.S.-supported rebels have maintained base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in their fight to overthrow the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. A provisional cease-fire has been in effect in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since March 21. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> noted that anti-communist rebels from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and leftist guerrillas from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> have used frontier territory for their war bases, damaging <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' social stability. He said the superpowers had created `` peculiar'' problems for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supporting the Contras and the Soviet bloc backing <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government and the Salvadoran rebels. There have been several anti-American demonstrations this year in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, which is considered one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s strongest allies in the region.

 <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> have started exchanging more than 3,700 prisoners of war, some held since the two Horn of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> neighbors began fighting over a patch of desert 11 years ago. The scheduled 10-day operation follows an accord signed by <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> in April and involves some prisoners held since hostilities began in 1977, said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>.

The Geneva-based group is supervising the exchange. The exchange left 3,421 Ethiopians in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> and 118 Somalis in Ethiopian hands. Under an April 6 accord, both sides agreed to withdraw troops from their borders, a move which was completed in May. They also agreed to swap prisoners and restore diplomatic relations, severed at the outbreak of the 1977-78 <LOCATION> Ogaden </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> had invaded the arid region, which <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> owns but is populated by ethnic Somalis.

 Seven senior members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> want the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to add provisions in future defense contracts to ensure that any illegally gained profits can be recovered by the government.

<HEAD>School Costs: $4,810 Per Pupil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> says the cost of sending <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children to public elementary and secondary schools is expected to be $ 4,810 this year, up more than $ 2,000 since 1980. The new estimate puts spending on education well ahead of inflation in this decade, department statistics released Tuesday show. The $ 2,762 per pupil spending of the 1980-81 school year would have risen to $ 3,462, if simply adjusted for inflation. Yet the department expects spending to top that by nearly 39 percent. Increased spending by state and local governments in an effort to improve schools was cited by statistician <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> as a major reason for spending being ahead of inflation. Overall, the agency expects education spending at all levels, public and private, to rise to $ 328 billion for the coming school year, a record. That is up from $ 308.8 billion last year and $ 182.8 billion in 1980-81.

 The president of the private <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is using a disputed Soviet radar facility in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> as an excuse to undercut the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. A five-year review of compliance with the treaty, which restricts <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet anti-missile defenses, opens on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has authorized <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> negotiators to accuse the Soviets of a `` material breach'' of the pact with the radar facility at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>. Such a charge would give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the right to break out of the treaty. <PERSON> Spurgeon </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeny </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday he agrees the facility violates the treaty.

<TEXT>
 Nearly 40,000 owners of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> cars whose odometers were disconnected while company executives test-drove them are entitled to more than $ 16 million in restitution under a nationwide settlement. Attorneys general from 10 states assisted in the settlement, which will pay the wronged car owners at least $ 500 apiece, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> already has announced it will increase warranty coverage for cars on which odometers had been disconnected in the company's `` Overnight Evaluation Program.'' A few were involved in accidents, and consumers that later purchased those cars will receive new automobiles, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> served as the lead negotiator in the settlement affecting 39,500 consumers in 46 states, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The agreement was filed Aug. 19 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The states that did not participate in the settlement were <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said his office and officials in some other states were mailing letters to the car owners. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also will run advertisements about the settlement in 20 newspapers Friday, he said. `` The practice by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> of selling what were supposed to be new cars which had already been driven hundreds of miles is in my opinion a deplorable business practice that results in deceiving consumers,'' said <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>, who also announced the settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the company has set aside $ 16.3 million to settle the claims, but will add more money to the reimbursement fund if that runs out. In the test-drive program, new cars were driven by company executives before the vehicles were shipped to dealers. The program had been going on for many years, said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, who added that mileage on the cars probably ranged from 40 miles to 300 miles. The settlement affects consumers who purchased a car made by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> before Oct. 9, 1986, and which was involved in the Overnight Evaluation Program. Consumers must have owned that car on July 31, 1987, to be reimbursed. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nangle </PERSON> will hold a fairness hearing regarding the settlement Oct. 11 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. Consumers who have objections about the settlement must file complaints with the court by Sept. 30. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said if the judge approves the settlement, most purchasers of the cars would receive payments early in 1989.

<HEAD>Obscure Clause In Trade Bill Aims To Make America `Measure Up'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Give'em an inch and they'll take a kilometer. Crusaders for wider use of the metric system are happy about an obscure section of the trade bill signed Tuesday by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a section they say will help <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> measure up in a metric world. The bill designates the metric system as the preferred method of measure for trade and commerce and requires government agencies to start buying metric whenever practical. For the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Metric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which since 1916 has been prodding <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to join most of the world in using metric measure, the bill is a milestone, or perhaps a kilometer post. `` I think the government's decision to adopt this law is pulling the country in the right direction,'' said <PERSON> Lorelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, association president. `` We interpret it to be saying that the metric system is highly important to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ to educate our youngsters in this scientific world, to put us in sync with the rest of the world and to give us the advantage of the best measurement system ever devised.'' The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 gives <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators more leeway to bargain at international trade talks, strengthens the government's ability to fight restrictive trade policies of other countries, and provides for retraining of Americans who lose their jobs because of foreign competition. It also says that by 1993, agencies should `` use the metric system of measurement in procurement, grants and other business-related activities, except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiency or loss of markets to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. firms.'' Analysts at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> do n't expect much impact from the section because of the language giving agencies an economic out, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a vice president of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, lobbying group But for the 3,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Metric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes the switch nationwide from its headquarters in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Northridge </LOCATION>, the bill seems likely to hasten the inevitable conversion. Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> recalled with relish that the bill's example of an economic hardship big enough to win an exemption from the metric policy was a company faced with competition from a foreign producer of non-metric goods _ an unlikely situation. Automakers and other sectors of heavy industry are gradually getting on the metric bandwagon, Ms. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said, though lumber and machine tool industries are notable for their adherence to tradition. `` Our liquor industry has n't suffered,'' she noted, `` and they were one of the first to convert.'' The metric system uses weights and measures, such as the liter and the gram, that are multiples of 10. Calculations in the traditional English system are more difficult because that system is based on varying multiples. Little has been done to promote use of the metric system nationwide since passage of the Metric Act of 1975, said <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON>, executive director of the association. `` The act set up a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> metric board that would monitor a changeover and educate the public, but it was not given any real clout,'' she said. `` They did n't really get any place.''

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE ISRAELI CORVETTE GEULA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is building three huge missile boats and two submarines under a U.S-financed program that will better equip it to thwart terrorist attacks, the nation's <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> chief says. Rear Adm. <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Shoshan </PERSON> outlined details of the $ 1.2 billion program on Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Day. He said the submarines and two of the three missile boats should be deployed by the mid-1990s. `` The terrorists are making serious efforts to invest people, resources and training to develop a better capability. We must be prepared in time,'' <PERSON> Ben-Shoshan </PERSON> said. The missile boats will carry new weapons against aircraft, missiles and submarines. The new ships, each to cost $ 120 million, are nearly 400 feet long and will accommodate more weaponry and helicopters. `` We believe this ship must carry many weapons because we have a lot of enemies and very few missile boats,'' said <PERSON> Ben-Shoshan </PERSON>. He said one new weapons system is the <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> anti-missile missile, to be deployed in the early 1990s. Described as highly accurate, it carries an explosive head weighing 48 pounds and can be used at a range up to 7 -LCB- miles. <PERSON> Ben-Shoshan </PERSON> said the anti-missile missile was preferable to systems designed to confuse and divert incoming missiles. `` We must have a hard kill, and the <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> system gives us a hard kill. This will be the answer to the missile threat for the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> navy,'' he said. He said the system could also be used against helicopters and ships. The new ships are needed to replace French-designed boats up to 20 years old. Those include some of the vessels <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> commandeered from <LOCATION> Cherbourg </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> imposed an arms embargo because of the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> has 28 missile-carrying ships, including two highspeed hydrofoil craft shown for the first time Tuesday. The <LOCATION> Geula </LOCATION>, demonstrated for reporters outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern port of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s largest ship. The Israeli-built vessel is 198 feet long, weighs 450 tons and carries a helicopter. It is armed with U.S.-made Harpoon surface-to-surface missiles and Vulcan Phalanx anti-aircraft guns. <PERSON> Ben-Shoshan </PERSON> said the terrorist threat remains high even though guerrillas launched just five attacks from the sea last year. In the past three years, the <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> has killed 58 guerrillas and captured 100, he said. During the past year, the navy stopped two attempts by Lebanese Shiite Moslems to plant mines and on two occasions destroyed guerrilla boats hiding among fishing vessels off <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ben-Shoshan </PERSON> said. It also stopped a rubber raft trying to enter Israeli waters. <PERSON> Ben-Shoshan </PERSON> reached agreement with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on financing the expansion program during a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in June. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms are bidding to build the ship and various systems and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was among European countries competing to build the submarines. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has three aging British-made Vickers Type 206 submarines. It turned to European manufacturers after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to build the diesel-powered submarines. <PERSON> Ben-Shoshan </PERSON> gave no details on the new submarines. The admiral defended <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s stopping ships in international waters of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, saying it has to go as far afield as needed to protect its coastline. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> stopped 40 ships in the past year and about four were found to have hostile intent. The navy impounded 10 other vessels carrying 10 tons of drugs, most of it hashish, he added.

 First lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has taken a close look at work being done on the $ 2.5 million <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> estate where she and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will live after they leave the White House. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spent Tuesday afternoon at the single story, ranch-style home nestled in the shadow of the `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hillbillies </LOCATION>'' TV mansion as workers busied about and tourists passed by in search of stars' homes. `` Welcome <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>,'' said a hand-lettered sign posted by a neighbor. `` Lost, 2 Cats _ <ORGANIZATION> Tan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Dark,'' said another sign, on a tree across the street. Secret Service agents in the driveway peeked through trees and over gates while Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was inside the 35-year-old house, which has a view of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and downtown. `` She's checking on the progress. She wo n't be making major renovations, just some grooming,'' said her spokeswoman, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had appointments with painters, carpenters and wallpaper hangers this week, she said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has yet to see the leased home, which has three bedrooms, six bathrooms, a formal living room, a family room, sun room, a butler's pantry and three servants' rooms. The house, where the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> will live after the next president is inaugurated on Jan. 20, was known for years as the `` demon house'' because of its 666 Saint Cloud Road address. The number was recently changed to 668 because of the Satanic nature of the old number, referred to in the New Testament as the sign of the Antichrist. The street is lined with tall pines, eucalyptus trees and huge oleanders. From the street, onlookers can see a rose garden through the chain-link fence. `` It's sure rich,'' tourist <PERSON> Irv </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroker </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION> said as his family surveyed the neighborhood. `` I wish I lived here,'' said his wife, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>. Decorator <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Graber </PERSON>, commissioned by Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to redo the family quarters in the White House, is helping the first lady with the house. Ms. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will use furnishings from the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' former <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION> home that have been in storage, and items from the White House. The estate, reached by driving up winding roads, is a modest residence in the pricey <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> neighborhood. Neighbors include <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> and, next door on higher ground, the <LOCATION> Kirkeby </LOCATION> estate, where `` Hillbillies'' was filmed. Vans from three Hollywood tour lines pass by regularly, pointing out the `` Hillbillies'' mansion but bypassing the not-yet-famous <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> home. The estate is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a group of about 20 unidentified <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> friends who bought it on Aug. 21, 1986. The three-year lease gives the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> the option to renew the lease or purchase the property. The estate includes 1.4 acres of grounds, the house with 7,192-square-feet of living space and a pool. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> also own an adobe house at <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cielo </ORGANIZATION>, their vacation ranch on a 2,250-foot-high mountaintop 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>U.N. Experts Find Iraq Used Mustard Gas Against Iranian Civilians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team of chemical weapons experts has backed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s claim that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> dropped mustard gas on an Iranian city this month in a raid that came after both sides had accepted a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution. In a note attached to the report Tuesday, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said the bomb attack violated provisions in the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention on the use of poison gases. There were no reported deaths in the Aug. 2 attack on the city of <LOCATION> Oshnaviyah </LOCATION>, which is a few miles from the northeast corner of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, though <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said 2,680 people were injured. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> denied responsibility for the raid. The chemical weapons experts said they found medical and chemical evidence of mustard gas, including shell fragments like those used in previous gas attacks, when they visited the site Aug. 12-14. The attack at 2:45 a.m. on the civilian residents of <PERSON> Oshnaviyah </PERSON> took place `` in an area adjacent to an urban center lacking any protection against that kind of attack,'' the team said in its report to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. At the time of the attack, both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had accepted <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598, which calls for a cease-fire in their nearly 8-year-old war, though negotiations on a truce starting date were still in progress. Patients injured in the attack and Iranian authorities told the team that a propeller-powered plane dropped eight bombs as most residents slept. Four bombs landed in a neighboring field and four fell in nearby mountains. When the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team arrived, 24 of those injured in the attack were still hospitalized, most of them farmers who lived near the field where the four bombs fell.

<HEAD>Doom May Await Fourth Comet Discovered By Amateur Astronomer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fairly close brush with the sun may spell doom for the fourth comet discovered by an amateur astronomer who spends 100 nights a year searching for the `` dirty snowballs'' in space. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Machholz </PERSON>, who holds a kind of unofficial record for the most hours spent unsuccessfully comet watching, spotted <PERSON> Comet </PERSON> <PERSON> Machholz </PERSON> 1988j with his giant, homemade binoculars on Aug. 6, but conceded there's `` some cause for concern about its existence.'' The comet `` might sort of fizzle out'' about the time it makes its closest approach to the sun on Sept. 17, agreed <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegrams </ORGANIZATION>. `` That happens with comets that are not terribly big to start with going only 15 million miles from the sun. It's pretty hot there. It may disintegrate completely,'' <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said by phone from <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, where his agency records astronomical discoveries. `` It's 80 million miles from the sun as we speak,'' <PERSON> Machholz </PERSON> said Tuesday from his office in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>. `` It will go twice as close to the sun as Mercury and six times as close as Earth.'' <PERSON> Machholz </PERSON> said the comet is `` a very nice looking comet, but it's not getting brighter as it should,'' suggesting that the dust-laden balls of ice is too small to give off enough gas and dust to form a bright head It wo n't be the first time a comet broke up after being discovered by <PERSON> Machholz </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, who works at a company that makes medical lasers. But he does n't mind. `` It's kind of a gift to find a comet. You're grateful,'' he said. `` So if it's taken away, that's the way it goes.'' <PERSON> Machholz </PERSON> said his second discovery, <ORGANIZATION> Comet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machholz </ORGANIZATION> 1985 VIII, disintegrated when it got within about 11 million miles of the sun. He also discovered comets Machholz 1978 XIII and Machholz 1986 VIII. During a typical year, about six comets are discovered and six known comets are `` recovered,'' or spotted during their latest orbits through the inner solar system, <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said. The ` j' in the new comet's name means it is the year's 10th either discovered or recovered. Last year, a record 16 comets were discovered and 17 recovered. Comet Machholz 1988j `` is a couple hundred times fainter than the North Star,'' <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said. `` It's not going to be a bright comet,'' and is likely to be seen only by advanced amateur astronomers using telescopes. While more comets have been discovered by other astronomers, <PERSON> Machholz </PERSON> holds the record of four for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> amateur astronomers who are still alive, <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Machholz </PERSON> made his latest discovery after 475 hours of observation from his customary viewing spot, along a dirt road 3,300 feet up <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION>, a peak in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` I'm up there about 100 nights a year. Most of the time it's after midnight,'' he said His biologist wife, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>, and 2-year-old son accompany him but sleep in the back of the family truck. As with his 1986 discovery, <PERSON> Machholz </PERSON> spotted the comet using a pair of homemade binoculars weighing 150 pounds. He found his first two comets with a 10-inch reflector telescope. `` I enjoy comet hunting,'' he said. `` It's a challenge.'' Despite his discoveries, <PERSON> Machholz </PERSON> is better known for spending 1,700 hours searching before discovering his first comet. His second comet took 1,742 hours to find. `` It's the longest period of time anybody is known to have spent unsuccessfully comet hunting,'' <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said.

 Officials plan to give hogs raised by the corrections department a chance to pig out on 350 tons of crackers that have been in storage 26 years. The <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> found the crackers had not gone rancid, and began looking last month for ways to get rid of them, said department administrator <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. She said the crackers no longer are tasty and have lost some nutritional value. Corrections officials requested the crackers to feed the hogs. The prison system slaughters about 4,400 swine each year, and uses the pork to feed inmates. Ms. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said the city received several requests from private farmers for the crackers, but `` there was really no fair and operable way to offer them to individuals and organizations.'' The 50,000 boxes of canned crackers will be hauled to the <ORGANIZATION> Jackie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brannon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> McAlester </LOCATION> and mixed in with hog feed, which will later be distributed to swine farms at other prisons, officials said.

<TEXT>
 Stock prices fell, while the dollar gained against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trading Wednesday. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 159.23 points Tuesday, closed at 27,799.67 for a loss of 120.28 points, or 0.43 percent. On the foreign exchange market, the dollar, which jumped over the 134-yen level to start the day at 134.25 yen, closed at 134.30 yen, up 0.37 yen from Tuesday's close. The dollar was stronger despite of dollar-selling by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank and several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> banks aimed at curbing the currency's recent rise, exchange dealers said. `` The yen's value fell because investors here sold yen to buy government bonds, which led the dollar to jump up this morning,'' said a dealer at a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Traders at the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said the market remained in a wait-and-see mood following the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index's 159.23-point loss on Tuesday. Some traders said the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> markets were awaiting a scheduled meeting Thursday of the West German <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, in light of the mark's recent weakness against the dollar. `` Until investors find out what happens to interest rates in West German banks on Aug. 25, the stock market is unlikely to be active,'' the dealer said.

 Police bulldozed unstable brick and mud houses today while those left homeless by an earthquake that killed at least 749 people sought shelter and awaited government aid. Casualty reports continued to trickle in from remote parts of this Himalayan mountain kingdom as relief workers fanned out through the foothills and valleys. Sunday's pre-dawn quake struck near the India-Nepal border. Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that followed the quake. Others had cracks three feet deep or were blocked by boulders the size of houses. At least 549 people were killed in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Tek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahadur </PERSON> <PERSON> Thapa </PERSON> of the Home Affairs Ministry. <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION> was hardest hit. At least 131 bodies were found in the city of 100,000. Indian officials have maintained since Monday that the death toll in their country was 200 or less, but the figure was questioned by opposition politicians, survivors and the local media, including the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper that generally supports the government. They put the <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500. Indian officials said 200 people were injured in the quake. Nepalese officials listed 752 injured, down from their earlier estimate of 1,000. In <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION>, a city of 50,000 where seven people died in the quake, 63-year-old <PERSON> Nhuchhe </PERSON> <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakya </PERSON> said his five-story brick and mud house had nearly fallen down but that he and his family of 10 were still living in it. `` What else can we do?'' the goldsmith said. `` We have no tent. How can I leave my place?'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Marich </PERSON> <PERSON> Man </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrestha </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION> on Tuesday and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once three-story and five-story houses. `` This is the biggest calamity to strike <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shrestha </PERSON> said as he toured the town. <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION>, 105 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, sits on a rolling plain at the base of a steep hill. Most of the victims died in their houses, which were made of bricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal monsoon rains. Police Inspector <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adhikari </PERSON> said bulldozers have demolished more than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation. `` We will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied -LRB- the ones remaining -RRB- are safe to live in,'' he said. <PERSON> Adhikari </PERSON> said local officials had not yet heard from the government on compensation or new housing for people whose homes were demolished. Most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors or found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth. The earthquake, which struck when most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950, when a temblor in the east Indian state of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists' accounts Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's quake, and rumors of an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into the streets in panic before dawn Tuesday in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION>. The rumors started with anonymous telephone calls and spread by word of mouth. In <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION>, men ran from houses to houses rousing people from their sleep.

 Three siblings whose parents have fought with school officials since spring because the children were not allowed to preach at the school gates will be taught at home, a mediator says. `` We pretty much got what everybody wanted,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodden </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Caleb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> rights organization negotiating with school officials on the family's behalf. <PERSON> Rodden </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> of <LOCATION> McDowell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> had signed a statement asking that their children be removed from <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and be taught at home. But the county school superintendent, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON>, said he was not sure an agreement had been reached. Who would teach the children and what arrangements would be made were not disclosed to reporters. Strode, who is unemployed, said his family could not afford to hire a teacher or to pay for at-home instruction. <PERSON> Rodden </PERSON> said his organization would help with the education and even help the 40-year-old Strode find a job. On Monday, the children's first day of school lasted less than a minute, ending with 11-year-old <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> being suspended for 10 days. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, and his 6-year-old brother, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, began shouting Bible verses while at the gate and their 7-year-old sister, Pepper, yelled `` Repent.'' `` We were there to welcome them to school,'' said <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorst </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> stuck his Bible in my face and he said, ` You go to hell.''' The <PERSON> Strodes </PERSON> did not meet with school officials Tuesday but allowed <PERSON> Rodden </PERSON> to shuttle between the school and the Strode home 1 -LCB- blocks away for negotiations. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he hoped to reach an agreement that would result in both sides waiving the right to future litigation. <PERSON> Rodden </PERSON>, the superintendent and <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> Assistant Principal <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> and Assistant Superintendent <PERSON> Shearon </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. Further meetings were planned for Tuesday morning, <PERSON> Rodden </PERSON> said, he was `` working to save the marriage'' between the children and the school. But by noon, he said, `` I realized the marriage was unsavable and we went for a divorce.'' Although <PERSON> Rodden </PERSON> said the agreement satisfied everyone, Strode left the house late in the day with his eyes red, apparently from crying. `` As the world builds bigger and better schools and bigger and better churches, the children are going to hell by the thousands,'' he said before turning away. The children were suspended repeatedly last spring when they stood behind the school screaming Bible verses and refusing to enter the building when asked. Their favorite verse is Hebrews 13:4: `` Marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled. But whoremongers and fornicators God will judge.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> says it will pay the salaries of the more than 20,000 educational, health and administrative workers in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied lands who <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> says it will no longer pay. But <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in a statement Tuesday, did not say where the salaries would come from or how they would be paid. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> early this month announced it was letting go the 21,200 employees in phases, gradually eliminating payment of about $ 45 million in salaries a year. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said his decision to abandon his claim to the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and to sever financial links with the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was aimed at giving greater responsibilities to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> shall shoulder full responsibility for the employees and workers as regards rights entitled to them, salaries and wages, on the basis of the regulations and lists of their appointments to office,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said in the statement, which was made available by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. The statement was referring to the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> government salary scale, used to pay many of the employees who worked in schools, hospitals, government offices and other institutions. Although <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> laid off or retired the employees, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said they would remain in their current positions. The statement added that `` all law and regulations in force in the occupied territories shall remain in force until such time as they are amended or abrogated by the Palestinian legislative authorities.'' It did not elaborate. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has been debating the possible formation of a provisional government or government-in-exile for the territories. In addition to severing administrative links to the territories, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> canceled a $ 1.3 billion development plan for the territories and dissolved the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, half of whose members were Palestinians. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> later announced it would issue temporary two-year passports for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents that would no longer confer Jordanian citizenship but could be used as travel documents. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has said the changes are in response to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s desire to `` secede'' and form its own state with its heart in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The occupied territories have been wracked by an 8 -LCB- - month-old uprising against Israeli rule The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has substantial, although largely secret, financial resources provided by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries and the Palestinian diaspora outside the Arab world. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders have vowed to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> from taking over any of the salaries or services on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> wants to resume talks Friday with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on a non-aggression pact and on the north's demand to co-host the Olympic Games, officials said today The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> made the announcement after its senior delegate, Rep. <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Joon-kyu </PERSON>, held a private meeting with his North Korean counterpart, <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol </PERSON>, at the truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. Park refused to disclose details of the private meeting. He said the south's decision on resuming talks would be relayed to the north. Assembly officials were reluctant to say whether they believed the deadlocked talks, which began Friday and collapsed Monday, could be revived. But one senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, `` Neither side wants to take the blame -LRB- for breaking off the talks -RRB-.'' Although <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said he expected `` new proposals'' from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, he admitted he was not encouraged by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s stand at today's meeting. `` Is n't it meaningful that the talks would continue?'' he said when asked about prospects of the upcoming meeting. Friday's meeting would be the fourth in talks between lawmakers of the two Koreas on sharing the Olympics and various peace measures, including a non-aggression pact. The talks ended in a stalemate on Monday, with both sides failing to fix a date for further talks. South Korean delegates said after a third round of talks on Monday that they hoped to postpone further contacts until after the Olympics, scheduled for Sept. 17 through Oct. 2 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called for urgent talks on the Olympics, but they were not so enthusiastic in pursuing the subject. They seemed more concerned about a non-aggression pact. In an effort to break the deadlock at Monday's meeting, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> proposed a private meeting between the senior delegates of the two sides. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> agreed to consider the suggesion. The talks were called to prepare for full-scale parliamentary talks on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s bid to co-host the Olympics, and on other measures, including a non-aggression pact, to ease tension between the nations. The two sides differed over an agenda and the size of the talks. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> insists the main talks include the full legislatures of both sides, involving nearly 1,000 members, but the south wants delegations of up to 30 lawmakers from each side. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> also wants the two parliaments to publish a joint declaration of non-aggression, which seeks, among other things, the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and nuclear weapons allegedly in their arsenal. The south sees the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces as vital to its defenses against the communist north. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said it will boycott the Olympics unless it can co-host them. The International Olympic Committee has rejected the North Korean demand, saying the Olympics are given to a single city and can not be shared. The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since their land was divided at the end of World War II in 1945. They fought the Korean War from 1950 to 1953.

 A maintenance worker on <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s Cyclone roller coaster was taking a ride on his lunch break when he wriggled free of the safety bar and stood up, causing him to fall to his death, police said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, 26, was alone in the last car when he fell Tuesday, apparently ignoring signs that warn customers not to stand up, said Detective <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McConville </PERSON>. `` This guy wanted to stand up and say ` Hey!' I guess standing up is a death wish,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Huggins </PERSON>, an inspector for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buildings </ORGANIZATION>' Elevator Division, which inspects amusement rides. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> dropped about 30 feet and landed on a crosstie on a lower portion of the ride's wooden track. He died instantly, authorities said. <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Astroland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amusement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> had asked for permission to take a lunchtime ride on the 61-year-old roller coaster, which was made a city landmark last month. He fell off the ride as it began its 90-foot first drop, <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> said. Each of the three cars is equipped with a heavy steel safety bar that is locked on the outside before the ride begins, making it difficult for the rider to stand up or be thrown out during the ride, which twists and turns at nearly 70 mph, <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> said. `` It's impossible to get out, but he wiggled out, he was standing, and he was thrown,'' <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> said, who added that the death was not due to any mechanical failure of the ride. The death was the first fatality at the park in at least 25 years, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, a co-owner of <LOCATION> Astroland </LOCATION>.

 State-run radio said <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s leaders lifted martial law in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> today and ordered troops out of the capital's center, where thousands of anti-government protesters rallied for a third straight day. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service said 200,000 people, including many government officials and merchants, took part in demonstrations that virtually shut down the city of 3.5 million people. Protest leaders called for a Friday rally in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to press for an end to one-party rule in the isolated Southeast Asian nation. State-run Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> signed a decree lifting martial law, which was slapped on <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> Aug. 3 following anti-government demonstrations. The order took effect at 1 p.m.. An order signed by Brig Gen. <PERSON> Myo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> area commander, withdrew the military administration from the capital an hour earlier, the radio said. A second presidential decree lifted martial law in the town of <LOCATION> Prome </LOCATION>, about 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said. Martial law was imposed there July 22 after mobs destroyed houses and shops. Demonstrators led by students and saffron-robed <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks gathered in the morning outside <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> General Hospital, diplomats and media accounts said. The hospital has been the main rallying site since troops shot medical personnel there earlier this month. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said some protesters drove cars through the city and called on people to join the peaceful rally and march. They shouted `` Down with Dictatorship!'' and `` We only need Democracy!'' <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said. Many shops were shuttered, the agency said. No violence was reported. Hundreds of thousands of people across <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> took to the streets from Aug. 8 to Aug. 12 to protest the transfer of power from strongman Ne Win to hard-liner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, widely hated in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> for ruthlessly suppressing dissent. Clashes with security forces left, by official count, 112 people dead and 267 wounded in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> alone. But diplomats say hundreds of people may have died in the protests before <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s resignation Aug. 12 after just 17 days in power Amnesty International charged Tuesday that <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> troops killed at least 1,000 demonstrators during the unrest. Citing reliable reports, the human rights organizaton said soldiers killed up to 3,000 demonstrators, mostly unarmed and peaceful. Soldiers repeatedly fired into unarmed peaceful crowds and at protesters who turned violent when the student-led unrest peaked, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said in a report out of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Students have mounted demonstrations in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> almost daily since they spearheaded the rioting that led to <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s resignation On Tuesday night, the government acknowledged the most recent protests for the first time. The broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said security forces in <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION>, 45 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, fired on demonstrators who drove four vehicles at them Monday night. It did not say if anyone was injured. The report said demonstrators also looted and destroyed a customs warehouse there Tuesday, sank a motorboat and fled with the agents' weapons. Sunday night, protesters destroyed a government building in <LOCATION> Sandoway </LOCATION>, 95 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. It also reported demonstrations in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, the northern city of <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Meiktila </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, but gave no crowd estimates. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said about 200,000 people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, the country's second-largest city. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, 63, is <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader since Ne Win's 1962 military coup replaced democracy with rigid socialist one-party rule The new government has freed more than 600 people arrested during the earlier rioting. But several prominent figures rounded up last month in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> still are held. They include <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s leading dissident, and Sein Win, the <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. An <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat said today the daughter of slain Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, a leader in the struggle for independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, called for a united front against the government and a rally of 1 million people Friday to demand full democracy. The daughter, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, lives in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> but is visiting her mother in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rally was planned for an athletic field in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate.

<HEAD>Miners Go On Strike in Hungary</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDds UPDATES thruout with details. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least 150 coal miners were on strike in southern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> today, and many more miners were joining the stoppage, official reports said. Reports on strikes in communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are rare. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the stoppage near the town of Pecs was over wages and had `` no political undertones.'' It said a senior official from <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> had gone to the <ORGANIZATION> Mecsek </ORGANIZATION> coal mines near Pecs, just north of the Yugoslav border, to mediate the dispute. The official, <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapolyi </PERSON>, returned to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> today with representatives from the miners' management and the work force to negotiate with the government over wage grievances, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovacs </PERSON>, head of the official mineworkers' union, was also said to be taking part in the negotations. In media discussions in recent months, he has criticized management of the mining industry. The relatively swift reporting of the stoppage appeared to reflect the greater openness seen in the state-run media since <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> took over as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party leader and head of a reform-minded Politburo in May. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said trouble started Tuesday evening when 150 miners refused to start work on the evening shift. <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> radio said `` many more'' joined the strikers today, but it gave no numbers. The strikes came at a time of widespread labor unrest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where coal miners, dockworkers and transit workers have gone on strike to demand reinstatement of Solidarity, the only independent labor federation ever allowed in the Soviet bloc. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the workers in <LOCATION> Pecs </LOCATION> were complaining that the new personal income tax introduced in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on Jan. 1 has cut their bonuses by up to one-third. `` It is especially irritating for the miners that miners on sick leave often earn more than their colleagues on regular shifts,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said, describing this as `` another unwelcome byproduct of the recently introduced personal income tax.'' Radio <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> said in its morning broadcast that miners were also complaining that unspecified legitimate demands had not been met `` for years'' and that other unspecified steps were taken `` over their heads.'' The manager of the mine was said by the radio to have expressed sympathy for the miners' grievances. One miner was quoted as saying, `` We are seeking a solution of our problems. If that is impossible, we accept the closure of the mine. But the present situation must be changed.'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s official trade unions have been highly critical of recent economic policy, emphasizing that workers, pensioners and the unemployed must be protected against price rises caused by government efforts to curb the $ 18 billion foreign debt and stimulate the stagnating economy. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the mine management had promised to return to Pecs from <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> tonight to report on the outcome of negotiations in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> with Industry Minister <PERSON> Frigyes </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> and other government officials.

 The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> says it is watching with concern the situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but it has not issued any official comment on an 8-day-old strike wave in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s western neighbor. Soviet media today issued reports on a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s Politburo, but offered no commentary. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, at a regular news briefing Tuesday, said, `` We closely follow the situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' `` We are, of course, very attentive and interested and we are concerned by the events of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' he said. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted a statement by the Polish Politburo saying that difficult living conditions and justified criticism of authorities were not acceptable reasons for the strikes plaguing the Soviet-bloc country. The strikes are the worst labor unrest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since 1981, when the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> government stifled the Solidarity free trade union movement with a military crackdown. `` Economic damage is piling up. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s prestige and economic confidence in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in international relations suffered substantially,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report said of the current strikes. It reported that the Politburo approved a letter to party members calling on them to counter the strikes. Asked if the strikes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and protests Sunday in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> on the 20th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of that country helped Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s opponents find fault with his policy of greater openness, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, `` I think you can find ammunition in any event.

 Pravda said today that a distant asteroid has been named after <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhmatova </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s favorite 20th century poets. Her work was barred from publication during most of her life. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Soviet scientists requested that the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> grant the name in honor of the poet's 100th birthday. <PERSON> Akhmatova </PERSON> was born in 1889 and gained fame for her works, inspired by the style of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Pushkin </PERSON>, before the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Her husband, fellow poet <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumilev </PERSON>, was executed by the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> in 1921, and officials frowned upon her work from then until 1940. She was rehabilitated during World War II, but lost favor again in 1946 and was expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Writers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for `` bourgeois decadence.'' <PERSON> Akhmatova </PERSON> was reinstated in 1959 and died seven years later. Her works are in great demand in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where poetry is a popular art form.

 The Hopi Indian tribe's religious beliefs have accomplished what giant spiders, ancient booby-traps, murder-minded ruffians and supernatural events failed to do _ halt the movie adventurer <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Lucasfilm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> movies starring <ORGANIZATION> Harrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, has withdrawn its request to film in the Long House Ruin mud and sandstone cliff dwellings at <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. `` We discovered that this was holy ground to the Hopi Indians,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, an executive producer for the film company, said Tuesday. `` We feel we have to respect their heritage and ancestors, and we have elected not to shoot there.'' The company had sought permission to film chase sequences there next month. The idea met with an outcry from conservationists who feared damage to the fragile 700-year-old ruins. In addition, actor <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Voight </PERSON> carried the religious objections of Hopi tribal elders to <ORGANIZATION> Lucasfilm </ORGANIZATION> executives, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. `` He happens to know us and came over to set the record straight, to make sure that we knew this.

<HEAD>Security Tightened As Moslems Mark Holy Day A Week After Zia Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government tightened security in several cities today to prevent sectarian strife among Moslems observing a solemn holy day one week after the death of President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s Shiites, a Moslem sect that constitutes about 5 percent of the country's 107 million people, joined processions through the streets of villages and cities to mourn the death of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s grandson, <PERSON> Imam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON>. Participants beat or flog themselves to show devotion to the martyr. Sectarian friction between the Shiites and the majority Sunnis typically increases on Ashoura, the holiday marking <PERSON> Imam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON>'s death that concludes today <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> and a group of followers were massacred in 680 in what is now the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Karbala </LOCATION> in a leadership fight between Moslem factions. Moslems later formed the Shiite and Sunni sects of the faith. Since the assassination three weeks ago of a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> religious leader in northwestern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, tension has increased between Shiites and Sunnis, and authorities feared the observance could lead to violence. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was a Sunni. In the southern port of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, as many as 40,000 Shiites marched through the main district in observance of the holiday. About 20,000 police, paramilitary units and army regulars dressed in full battle gear lined the streets along the procession. They drove vehicles mounted with machine guns and kept watch from rooftops along the seven-mile route. No clashes were reported. About 30 people have died this year in Sunni-Shiite gunbattles in northern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. New clashes were reported in the region after <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> died Aug. 17 in a plane crash. The English-language newspaper The <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that at least 10 people died and 10 were injured the last few days in Shiite-Sunni violence near <LOCATION> Kohat </LOCATION>, about 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. Pakistani officials say they believe <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s plane crash was a result of sabotage but have not said who they think is responsible. Some officials have hinted at agents of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s pro-Soviet government. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, supports the guerrillas trying to overthrow the Afghan government. Opposition leader <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s intelligence services received information her life was in danger following <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, leader of the country's largest opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said she was informed Tuesday that the government had posted armed guards outside her home. `` They informed me that they had received some threats so they wanted to post some guards,'' she said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at her home in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>. `` They told my secretary, ` We used to follow her for intelligence purposes but now we'll follow her to guard her.' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said she had no other details. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said she was seeking to form alliances with other opposition groups and reach agreements to prevent them competing for the same <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> seats in Nov. 16 elections. She strongly criticized the current Cabinet, calling the ministers `` dangerous'' holdovers from <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s regime. Thirteen of the 16 ministers were appointed by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. She called on new President <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> to appoint a caretaker government until elections. She expressed confidence that if elections were conducted fairly she would win.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general met a senior <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official today to prepare for direct Iran-Iraq peace talks and one of the negotiation's thorniest issues: repatriation of war prisoners. Security Council Resolution 598 urges release and repatriation of prisoners of war without delay after a cease-fire. Hostilities were halted one week ago, and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces took up positions along the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> border. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Slavko </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovic </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces, said the cease-fire was holding, despite minor problems over troop movements, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said today in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and his Iraqi counterpart, <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, were to arrive today for face-to-face talks, set to begin with Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on Thursday afternoon. The talks will mark the first direct discussions by top Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> envoys since the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war began in 1980. The U.N.-sponsored talks are aimed at reaching a comprehensive peace settlement of the Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has said he expects the talks to be long and difficult, lasting at least several months. The atmosphere surrounding the negotiations is bitter because of charges and countercharges of truce violations. The agenda was not disclosed, and <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief, told reporters today there is no time limit on the talks. However, he said the secretary-general must return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 20 and may have to shift the talks to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In an interview with the French daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that it was difficult to predict how long the peace talks might take. `` It all depends on the political will of the parties,'' he said in today's editions of the newspaper. `` If they really want to resolve the problem, it could take only a few months. If not, it could drag on for years and I would then name a personal representative to follow the negotiations.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief will meet separately with <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> Thursday morning and will be present when the two envoys meet in the afternoon in the Council Chamber at the headquarters of the former League of Nations, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. The secretary-general will be present during all meetings between the envoys during the first phase of discussions. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> met today with <PERSON> Cornelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommaruga </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> all-Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, to discuss the problem of repatriating prisoners of war. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> says both sides hold about 80,000 POWs, including more than 50,000 captured by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Many of the prisoners reportedly have rejected repatriation, called for under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials say they must interview each prisoner to determine his wishes before arranging a return. Resolution 598, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan, calls for a cease-fire, early troop withdrawal to international boundaries and repatriation of prisoners of war. It also calls on both sides to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief in reaching `` a comprehensive, just and honorable settlement'' of all outstanding issues. The long-term agenda for the talks also is expected to cover a border dispute over the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only access to the gulf and establishment of a commission to determine which side started the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after border shelling by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and a history of hostilities between the Arab and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> nations. Earlier today, an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil tanker passed through the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the first since the Iran-Iraq war began, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The strait is the narrow body of water at the southern end of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The Ain Zalah, carrying a load of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> crude oil, was the third Iraqi vessel to sail into the gulf since the cease-fire went into effect.

<TEXT>
 A treasure-hunter who has spent three years diving for riches from a Spanish galleon lost in a 1715 hurricane says a find of 900 silver coins has pointed him in the direction of the mother lode. `` It was a very good sign as far as letting us know we're going in the right direction. Who knows what's ahead now. We're very excited about that,'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> said Tuesday. The 63-year-old explorer from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> hopes to find $ 200 million in gold that went down with the <ORGANIZATION> Nuestra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regla </ORGANIZATION>, the flagship of an eight-galleon fleet that left <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, for <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in July 1715. In addition to the coins, the ship yielded two gold rings, a small silver statue of an angel holding a Christ child, several shoe buckles, pottery and other artifacts. <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> estimated the value of the find, his largest, at $ 250,000. However, a spokeswoman for treasure hunter <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who owns the wreck, said the coins alone could be worth $ 400 to $ 500 each, for a total of between $ 360,000 and $ 450,000. Twenty percent of the treasure and artifacts will go to the state and an undisclosed percentage to <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. `` We've been expecting to find a pretty good, sizable pile of coins somewhere along the line,'' said <PERSON> Volker </PERSON>, who made the find a few hundred yards off <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION>. `` We know there's a lot of treasure on the ship that's never been found,'' he added. Carrying a cargo of treasure for the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> crown, the ships were struck by a hurricane and sank along the central <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, killing 700 people. The Regla was smashed and its treasure strewn along the sandy coast and buried by subsequent storms and tides, making its discovery difficult, said <PERSON> Bleth </PERSON> <PERSON> McHaley </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s company Between 1964 and 1970, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> and his partners took about $ 20 million in treasure from the site, Ms. <PERSON> McHaley </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A three-year undercover operation has resulted in charges against 43 people accused of poaching black bears for their gall bladders, which are prized in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as aphrodisiacs and medicine. The federal-state probe was sparked by the danger poaching poses to the nation's black bear population, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday in announcing the charges. During the investigation, agents bought 266 gall bladders, 85 claws, 77 feet, four heads, nine hides and one live black bear cub, officials said. Among the items displayed at a news conference Tuesday were several plastic bags containing a bear's gall bladder, which resembles a swollen, heavily veined lima bean. The parts were sold to Asians in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and overseas, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hergenrader </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> wildlife agency. He said the gall bladder is dried and ground into a powder thought to be good for health and an aphrodisiac. Bear claws are used to make jewelry, and heads are used as trophies, <PERSON> Hergenrader </PERSON> said. Arrest warrants were issued in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for residents of the three states, and agents began making arrests early Tuesday. <PERSON> Hergenrader </PERSON> said the 43 people were charged with more than 130 federal and state violations. Officials estimate the black bear population in the southern Appalachians at about 2,000. The bears already are threatened by a loss of habitat. Areas in public land are set aside as bear habitat where hunting is prohibited. <PERSON> Hergenrader </PERSON> said some of the bears were legitimately killed, but he said it is illegal to sell any part of a bear no matter how or where it is killed. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said studies of the black bears indicated that `` we were driving our black bear population to extinction'' and that poaching accounted for half or more of the annual bear deaths. He described the poachers as `` a loose, informal network of people who knew who you needed to see if you want bear gall bladders.''

 An American accused of helping leftist guerrillas mount a terrorist attack left <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> after spending nearly five months in prison. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, 40, a native of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, flew out of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> on Tuesday for <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, after being freed from prison. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement expressing approval that she was released. On April 26, a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> court cleared her of charges she took part in an attack by Maoist Shining Path guerrillas that left two people dead. She was rearrested on the same charges Aug. 2 and was held in prison until Monday night. Her departure followed a tense hour at <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s international airport during which the embassy sent word that <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> was refusing to allow her to travel anywhere but to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, her lawyers said. One of her attorneys, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Burneo </PERSON>, said the embassy and former Mayor <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrantes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> made phone calls to Peruvian officials `` at the highest levels'' to gain approval for her departure. About 20 friends and reporters witnessed her departure at 5:15 p.m. aboard a Soviet Aeroflot flight. `` My name is cleared. I feel relieved,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> was first arrested Dec. 5 in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> state, 225 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, while she was on a trip through <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> as a tourist. She was charged with taking part in a guerrilla attack in August 1987 in <LOCATION> Vilcashuaman </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> in which two government employees were slain. Ms. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> was released from prison in April after the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> court cleared her of the charges. Her attorneys and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said two survivors of the attack in <LOCATION> Vilcashuaman </LOCATION> testified she was not among the assailants. Other witnesses said she was in <LOCATION> Puquio </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Vilcashuaman </LOCATION>, when the attack occurred. <ORGANIZATION> Lima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the ruling on July 13 and Ms. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> began making arrangements to leave <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. She was rearrested on an outstanding warrant stemming from the <LOCATION> Vilcashuaman </LOCATION> attack when she appeared at a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> police station on Aug. 2 to get approval to depart. She spent the next three weeks in prison as her attorneys fought to prevent her transfer to Cangallo, the province in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> state where <LOCATION> Vilcashuaman </LOCATION> is located. Her release came after an <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> court ruled Monday that she could not be tried twice for the same crime, <PERSON> Burneo </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said she would go to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and meet friends before seeking a job teaching English `` somewhere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' She reiterated her innocence to reporters Tuesday. She has frequently disavowed any ties with the Shining Path.

<TEXT>
 The army today demolished three homes belonging to Palestinians who allegedly killed an Arab collaborator and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sharply rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism of its deportation policy. Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began a two-day general strike to protest the deaths of four Arabs in Israeli prisons. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deputy secretary of state, urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to reconsider its policy of deporting <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists and said continued expulsions would damage relations between the two countries. The Israeli Foreign Ministry today responded: `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> does not accept the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interpretation of international law regarding deportations. ... The legality of deportations was checked recently by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled that deportations are legal, according to both Israeli and international law.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also explained <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policy on deportations in a 90-minute meeting today with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> refused to answer reporters' questions about the meeting, and <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> refused to elaborate. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported 33 Palestinians since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8. Last week, 25 more were ordered expelled. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>'s statement marked the first time the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has warned that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policies in the territories could threaten relations. The Haaretz and <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> dailies said <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> spoke to Israeli Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Oded </PERSON> <PERSON> Eran </PERSON> in a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Tuesday. An Israeli source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> confirmed the meeting. `` Whitehead's statement was sharp. I do n't see it as an ultimatum, but they definitely want us to stop the deportations,'' former <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimche </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said it uses the measure `` only as a last resort'' and calls it an acceptable means of deterring violence. The latest strike was called in a leaflet issued Tuesday by pro-PLO underground leaders of the uprising, who also urged solidarity with 5,000 Arab prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails. In <LOCATION> Jelazoun </LOCATION>, a refugee camp of 5,000 north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, soldiers ordered a curfew after destroying homes belonging to three alleged members of grassroots committees that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> outlawed last week. The three allegedly beat an Arab youth to death while interrogating him about suspected collaboration with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. An AP reporter saw two army jeeps blocking the entrance of the camp. The streets were virtually empty. The pre-dawn demolition came several hours before 14 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> aides were scheduled to visit the camp on a tour organized by the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, soldiers rounded up six Palestinians suspected of belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction, the army said. The suspects were accused of hurling three firebombs at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> targets and throwing an explosive at an Israeli bus, the army said. A bomb with a chemical charge was found in their possession, it said. The general strike paralyzed transportation and commerce in at least six major cities in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, some Palestinians violated the strike, the third in four days. Some shops were open and taxis transported some workers to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Masked Arab youths pelted rocks at some of the cars along a five-mile strip connecting <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The latest strike was called to honor `` martyrs behind bars,'' including two Palestinians shot to death in a prison riot last week and two who the army and police said committed suicide within the last month. Relatives said one of those said to have committed suicide, <PERSON> Nadil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Beduah </PERSON> of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, had his teeth knocked out and several ribs fractured before his death. At least 252 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed in the 8 -LCB- - month-old uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> against 21 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation

<TEXT>
 A foam producer has agreed to pay a record $ 700,000 in civil penalties to settle what is believed to be the first lawsuit in the nation filed by a state to stop emissions suspected of depleting the ozone layer. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> announced terms of the settlement Tuesday and said the company, <ORGANIZATION> PI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hyannis </LOCATION>, also agreed to end its emissions by year's end. The settlement must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> handling PI's reorganization and by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, where the suit was filed. The state accused PI with emitting 1,300 tons of chlorofluorocarbons a year in violation of state regulations. CFCs are a class of chemicals implicated in the decline of the ozone layer that protects Earth from solar radiation. The compounds are manmade chemicals used to create plastic foams, for cleaning electronic parts and for refrigeration. The chemicals were also used as propellants in aerosol cans until banned by the federal government in 1978. `` Our action demonstrates that we can make a difference in protecting the Earth's fragile environment,'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said. `` CFCs have been directly linked to the destruction of the ozone layer and consequently pose a threat to the Earth's survival.'' The attorney general's office found no record of any other state filing such a suit, said <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Breslauer </PERSON>. Telephone calls to PI's president and attorney were not immediately returned. Shortly before the attorney general filed suit in June, PI filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. According to news accounts, the company's insurer had become insolvent, leaving PI with no protection from numerous product liability suits. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenbaum </PERSON>, commissioner of the state's top environmental enforcement agency, said the resolution marks the first success by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> in its effort to stop unregulated emissions of CFCs.

 Up to $ 1 million in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> artwork stolen from The Walters Art Gallery has been discovered in a museum guard's basement, authorities say <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartgis </PERSON>, 30, a museum security supervisor, was arrested at his home Tuesday, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dearborn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bartgis </PERSON> was charged today with theft, punishable by up to 15 years in prison, said police Lt. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeson </PERSON>. Federal charges were not filed because the items did not leave the state, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. A bail hearing was expected later today. All 81 items reported stolen from the gallery Aug. 16 appear to have been recovered, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Corless </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` It looks like we've recovered all the items, plus some additional items we located that had n't been reported stolen as yet,'' said <PERSON> Leeson </PERSON>. The artwork includes jade, Chinese snuff bottles, figurines, incense burners, boes and an 18-inch porcelain vase dating to the 18th century known as the Peach Bloom Vase. The pieces were valued at between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million. Law enforcement agents found the art in boxes in Bartgis' basement, <PERSON> Leeson </PERSON> said None of the artifacts appeared to have been sold, he said. The theft from at least 13 plexiglass display cases on the museum's fourth floor was discovered after the curator returned from vacation. Other pieces in the cases had been rearranged to hide the theft, a museum spokesman said. The theft was `` very sophisticated and well planned'' and obvious only to those who knew the collection well, museum spokesman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said last week. Officials said Tuesday the theft appeared to be the work of one person. Law enforcement officials primarily investigated museum employees, said <PERSON> Leeson </PERSON>, who would not reveal why suspicion fell on <PERSON> Bartgis </PERSON>, a museum employee for 1 -LCB- years. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> administered polygraph tests to museum employees. `` We feel extraordinarily relieved that these treasures that belong to everybody in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> are back,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, director of the city-owned gallery. The Asian art was bequeathed to the city by railroad magnate <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> in 1931. The Peach Bloom Vase was purchased by <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>' father for $ 18,000 in 1886 and is one of the finest examples of that type of glaze in Chinese porcelain, <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> said. The insurer of the artworks, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, had offered a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to their recovery.

 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> today called for common rules and definitions of insider trading among world stock markets. Different rules and definitions of illegal dealing is hindering control of unscrupulous trading practices in the increasingly borderless equity markets worldwide, the chief of the leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exchange told reporters. `` Everybody comes from different culture and corporate background. But the users of those markets have to see those markets are fair and that they are not disadvantaged to work in them,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He urged each market to spell out its definition of insider trading, then work together to set up common rules. `` Within the market place, everybody talks the same language. But if it is perceived by any major participant that the market is unfair, there will be a lack of use of the market and that will be detrimental to everybody.'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> criticized the Japanese approach as `` a narrow interpretation,'' but he declined to assess recent measures by Japanese securities authorities. `` Their needs are different from our needs,'' he said. Several cases of what Western finance experts charge are insider trading deals _ buying and selling securities based on information not available to all _ are raising questions in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s financial community about the ethics of Japanese stock deals. In the most prominent case, several politicians' aides and senior journalists admitted buying stock of a real estate concern before the issues were made public, and making huge profits by selling the shares after they were listed.

 A bomb exploded outside a Wimpy hamburger restaurant today, causing minor damage but no injuries, police said. Three other Wimpy restaurants have been bombed since 1986, including one on Tuesday. Police said the latest blast, in the farming and mining town of <LOCATION> Standerton </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, was caused by a limpet mine placed in a travel bag. Officers were alerted by a passer-by and moved the bag away from the restaurant into the middle of a cordoned-off street before it exploded, police said. On Tuesday, 23 people were hurt when a limpet mine exploded at a Wimpy restaurant in the coastal city of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. A Wimpy outlet in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> was bombed in June 1986 and one in nearby <LOCATION> Benoni </LOCATION> was bombed last month. Police have blamed the attacks, as well as other recent bombings, on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> said last week that some civilian targets had been attacked by guerrillas acting against instructions to hit only government-related facilities.

<TEXT>
 One of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s largest newspapers today detailed an accord that led to the 1940 takeover of three Baltic republics. The report appeared one day after hundreds of thousands of residents protested the pact. The full-page article in <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper of the Russian republic, provided the first opportunity for many Soviets to learn details of the agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In the last two weeks, papers in the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> also have published details of the agreement, and on Tuesday people jammed parks and public squares to mark the 49th anniversary of its signing. Many Baltic people are seeking greater independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for their relatively advanced and westward-looking economies, and some radicals are agitating for independence. The small countries were independent after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 until they were added to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940. Lithuanian historian <PERSON> Robertas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhyugzhda </PERSON>, writing in <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> of the developments in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> violated principles of international relations and that <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s final contacts with the independent government of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> amounted to an ultimatum. But he said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s actions and concerns were understandable in the tense atmosphere building up to World War II. The pact signed Aug. 23, 1939, is commonly known as the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact after German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribbentrop </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Molotov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zhyugzhda </PERSON> revealed to Soviet readers that <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> were assigned under the agreement to a Soviet sphere of influence and that <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> originally was assigned to the German sphere. But in later negotiations after <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> attacked <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Sept. 1, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> was assigned to the Soviet sphere, which <PERSON> Zhyugzhda </PERSON> said was `` a gross violation of international principles and norms.'' Aside from recent publications in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republics </LOCATION>, today was the first time the Soviet press told its readers about the spheres of influence. Soviet officials say the non-aggression treaty with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> gave their country a vital two years to prepare for an attack by <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s forces, which finally came in June 1941. The historian said <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s government tried to reorient itself toward <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after signing a mutual assistance treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> responded by demanding a change in the Lithuanian government. `` From the point of view of normal diplomatic relations, such demands took the character of direct interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign country,'' he said. Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> on Tuesday to demand greater autonomy on the anniversary of the pact. Demonstrators waved the flags and sang the anthems of their former nations and carried banners denouncing the secret agreement. Authorities allowed the protests, and there were no reports of violence or arrests. The demonstrations, unprecedented in size, were another indication of foment in the area under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of greater openness <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said in a report on the gathering in the Estonian capital <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, that historian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> urged Estonians to cool their passion for independence. <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, one of the most outspoken critics of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, said: `` There might be various assessments of the 1939 pact, but one can not ignore present-day realities.'' `` The reality is that the Estonian economy is so much interconnected with the all-union economy that mechanical separation will inevitably lead the republic to economic disaster,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. In a report from the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said city officials had agreed to hoist the historic blue-and-white city flag of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> along with that of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and Soviet <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> on special occasions. The decision by <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> officals probably was meant as a small concession to nationalist feelings.

 A millionaire businessman whose ailing wife was kidnapped a month ago paid a total of nearly $ 1 million to 12 people listed in the ransom note as having been wronged by him, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> paid the ransom a day after receiving a second note, in his wife's handwriting, indicating for the first time since the abduction July 26 that <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrin </PERSON> is alive, said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in charge in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>.

Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, 72, suffers from an intestinal disorder that could be fatal without daily medication. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who released the second letter Tuesday, said he wanted to assure the woman's abductors that her husband `` has done everything conceivably possible to meet their demands, considering the vagueness of them.'' <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> had conferred with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> before deciding to pay the $ 1 million, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. Investigators have no leads in their search for the woman, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> analysis confirmed Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> wrote the letter dated Aug. 10; it was postmarked Aug. 12 and received at the Hearins' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> home on Aug. 15, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> would n't disclose the city from which the letter was mailed or discuss its contents other than to say `` it urged him -LRB- <LOCATION> Hearin </LOCATION> -RRB- to comply with the demands of the kidnappers.'' A vague note left at the Hearins' home the day of the kidnapping demanded <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> right alleged wrongs to 12 people. The 12 had been sued by <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>, for money they allegedly owed. At a news conference, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> disclosed that <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> paid the 12 nearly $ 1 million, which equals the court judgments against them. An attorney for <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> returned his check and wrote a letter saying he hoped <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s wife would be returned safely. `` Mr. <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> has no dispute with Mr. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>,'' said attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who did n't disclose the amount of the check. <PERSON> Hiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutts </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told The Clarion-Ledger that he received a check for $ 17,800 and `` a nice letter'' from <LOCATION> Hearin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stutts </PERSON> refused to say what he had done with his check. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> did n't owe me that much money. I settled mine out of court for half of the amount. I was happy with the settlement,'' he said. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanneld </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> also told the newspaper that he had received a check and letter from <LOCATION> Hearin </LOCATION> but said he did n't want to discuss it.

<HEAD>Largest Protestant Church Says Gays and Lesbians Can Be Ministers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Leaders of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, decided today that homosexuals can be considered for the ministry. The vote by the church's general council was 205 to 160 and followed months of heated debate in which one-quarter of the church's 4,000 ministers and 30,000 of its 860,000 members signed a declaration opposing the ordination of homosexuals. The decision at the council's biannual meeting in <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, came after midnight Tuesday and followed a marathon debate. It was expected to lead to resignations and a possible schism in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which was founded in 1925 as a union of the Congregational, Methodist and Presbyterian denominations in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. More than 350 delegates finally adopted this resolution: `` That all persons regardless of their sexual orientation, who profess faith in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and obedience to Him, are welcome to be or become full members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. All members of the church are eligible to be considered for ordered ministry.'' While some argued that `` sexual orientation'' could mean those with homosexual inclinations, conservative delegates interpreted the phrase as welcoming candidates who actively practice homosexuality. `` If we pass this, we do a far greater injustice to the people who sit in the pews,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Somerville </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. `` They will vote with their feet and their dollars if we're not sensitive to their needs.'' Ordination candidate <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Siksay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, a member of a national group for gays called Affirm, said: `` I'm very happy about what we've done so far. But no one in Affirm is under any illusion that tomorrow our task in the church will be any different.'' Opponents of homosexual ordination vowed to continue their fight, saying the recommendation changes the church's constitution and requires a poll of all 4,205 congregations. However, the Rev. <PERSON> Eilert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frerichs </PERSON>, a member of Affirm, tried to lessen fears by saying there will be no rush to the pulpit by gays and lesbians. `` Given the present controversy in the church surrounding sexual orientation, I do n't think there are going to be very many of us for the next 10 years at least who will stand up and say, ` I'm lesbian or gay I'm seeking ordination or commissioning.' I think God, in God's own time, will send us a final resolution.'' Church procedures leave ordination up to regional conferences and say it is inappropriate to ask candidates about sexual orientation. Only the <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, conference has a stated policy of not ordaining self-declared, practicing homosexuals. The vote followed a controversial report on sexuality last March which said homosexuality should not be a barrier to ordination and also suggested that sex outside of marriage was `` morally responsible in a committed relationship.'' The general council voted only to receive, not endorse, that report.

 Divers working 15-hour days to raise a historic ferry from the murky water off <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> came close to their goal before the deteriorated wreck sprang a leak and water rushed back into the hull. The double-decker, which before its retirement carried 12 million immigrants to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, had been pumped free of water and outfitted with pontoons Tuesday, organizers said. `` We were going real well,'' said Naval Reserve Cmdr. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Horney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` Then a small portion of the deck partially gave way. Over a period of years, it's just deteriorated.'' A series of Naval Reserve crews began working in April to refloat the vessel, which began service in 1904 for what was then the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION>, made its last run in 1954 and sank in 1968 while at dock. Bad weather forced another postponement today. `` We've been working very, very long hours for the past week and a half,'' said <PERSON> Horney </PERSON>, commander of 17 <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> divers who took on the project as their annual, two-week tour of active duty. `` We need something to occur to maintain the morale.'' The 160-foot-long vessel could carry 1,000 immigrants in its hold and was outfitted with a 12-bed sick bay and a padded cell for violent mental patients. Named the <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> after the site where immigrants to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were once processed, the ferry is about 15 feet under water at its lowest point. The starboard side juts out of the water at low tide, mired in silt and mud. All that remains is its cast-iron hull. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which administers <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, decided the wreck was a navigation hazard. The agency has n't decided what to do with the ferry but is dedicated to `` respecting the ship's historical significance.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workers struggling to make ends meet under <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s rising inflation stampeded while waiting on line to buy bread, and a newspaper said today that 20 people were injured. The incident occurred in the town of <LOCATION> Titov </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Veles </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s southernmost province, the <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> daily in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> said. It did not say when the stampede occurred. Quoting the local newspaper, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> said bakeries are told to make at least 60 percent of their production cheaper varieties of bread but that many stores do not follow this advice. As a result, `` many people ... wake up early in the morning to form lines in front of bakeries'' to obtain the less expensive loaves, the paper said. <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is the poorest part of the country, and many people have to manage on wages that are the equivalent of $ 50 to $ 100 a month. That is one-third to two-thirds of the average Yugoslav income. Their task is made more difficult by 170 percent inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to help <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> lower the inflation rate to 95 percent this year, says stringent economic controls, including a ban on wage increases, are necessary to win the fund's approval for rescheduling payment of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s $ 21 billion debt.

 An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb hidden in a van exploded today and hurled a passing patrol car across a road, injuring two policemen. The blast followed an explosion in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> that injured a pregnant woman. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for both attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> also announced today it will step up its attacks on commercial sites, in addition to British army targets. The Royal Ulster Constabulary said this morning's bomb in <LOCATION> Maghera </LOCATION>, about 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, was planted in a van parked on the side of the road. The blast lifted an armored police car into the air and hurled it across the road, slightly injuring the two officers inside, said a spokesman, who by custom was not identified. He said the officers were treated at a hospital for cuts and bruises. Police said `` a number of people have been arrested for questioning about serious terrorist crime.'' Police would not elaborate. On Saturday, a bomb hidden in a vehicle parked on the side of a highway near <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION>, about 30 miles from <LOCATION> Maghera </LOCATION>, exploded as a British military bus was passing by. Eight British soldiers were killed and 27 wounded. On Tuesday night, a bomb in a stolen car exploded near the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recruiting office in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, slightly injuring a pregnant woman and causing widespread damage to buildings, police reported. Police said those responsible for the attack had stolen the car after bursting in on a children's party in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. While some assailants held five adults and four children hostage in the house for several hours before releasing them unharmed, others loaded the bomb aboard the family car and drove it to the city center. Police said they received telephone warnings before the Tuesday night blast and cleared the area of most residents. The explosion was on a side street near the recruiting office, where Lt. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> had worked before being killed in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing on Monday. He died when an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb attached to his car exploded as he drove into east <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. He was the 26th British military man to die this year in <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks, compared with three last year. The mostly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has stepped up attacks recently in its fight to end British rule in this Protestant-dominated province and to unite it with the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. British authorities say the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has acquired sophisticated new explosives and detonators from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` It is our intention to begin using new devices in future car bomb attacks against commercial and administrative property, devices which will minimize the risk to the public,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement today. The statement unveiled a new car-bomb technique in which a smoke grenade would go off before a blast, giving bystanders time to flee. At the same time, a switch would be activated to immediately set off the main charge if police attempted a controlled explosion of the bomb. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, secretary of state for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, said he attributed the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s stepped-up violence to `` the fact that they've received increased armaments in terms of explosives and weapons from -LRB- <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. King, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' called the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> `` a dedicated, vicious Marxist revolutionary group.''

<TEXT>
 The chief of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s military resigned today to take responsibility for the deaths of 30 civilians killed when a naval submarine crashed into a sport fishing vessel. `` I presented Prime Minister -LRB- <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> with a notice of resignation today, just now,'' <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` Many innocent lives were lost in an extremely regrettable accident ... in which the defense force was one of the parties involved.'' <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON> was the first <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> director-general in 17 years to relinquish his post in a controversy linked to the armed forces. Only 18 of the 48 passengers on board survived when their fishing boat, the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru, collided with the submarine Nadashio in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on July 23. Public outrage flared when televised reports, backed by survivors' accounts, showed the submarine's crew standing by as people drowned. <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON>, speaking slowly and fighting back tears, urged his successor to work to restore public confidence in the military. `` There have been a large number of incidents involving the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and it is my hope that under the new director-general ... this problem will be dealt with.'' <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON>'s 10-month term as agency head was marred by accidents involving the military, which even in the best of times is unpopular. So far this year, eight ships and three planes were involved in 11 military accidents, and two pilots were killed. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Kichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tazawa </PERSON>, 70, the new <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief. <PERSON> Tazawa </PERSON> said at a televised press conference that he was taking his new responsibility `` under very difficult circumstances.'' He praised his predecessor's moves to investigate the submarine collision and said his main goal was implementing measures to prevent accidents. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, attending a memorial service for the 30 victims today, also said the government would take steps to prevent maritime accidents and promised compensation for the victims' families <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON>, 51, reportedly turned down the resignations of two other defense officials _ <PERSON> Seiiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishihiro </PERSON>, deputy <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> head, and Adm. <PERSON> Shuichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Higashiyama </PERSON>, chief of staff of the Maritime Self-Defense Forces.

 Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> today criticized his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponent as inexperienced and young, saying `` I do n't think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can risk'' having <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a heartbeat away from the presidency. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who has shied away from attacking his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleague, dropped his reticence before the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, a bipartisan lawmakers' group that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will also address later today. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he was surprised when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, suddenly announced his support for making the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> a cabinet-level agency. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was one of only 11 senators to oppose the bill, but before the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Monday night he `` made a deathbed conversion,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the VFW his vote against the bill was a `` youthful indiscretion.'' `` A youthful indiscretion? My friends, that vote occurred only five weeks ago,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can risk youthful indiscretion in someone who could become our president at any moment,'' the 67-year-old <PERSON> Texan </PERSON> said of his 41-year-old opponent. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been touring the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> in a campaign to sell running mate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to Southerners skeptical of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, and more of that was expected in today's speech.

One of the goals of the week, which will include <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s own speech to the VFW on Thursday, is to show that `` Republicans do n't have proprietary rights over patriotism,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s top aides In addition to his open campaign schedule, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s days have a liberal sprinkling of private fund-raisers, including a $ 1,000-a-person event at a private home in the ritzy <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> on Monday night.

 Armed men attacked a base camp of nine French, Canadian and <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> climbers high in the Andes near the Peruvian border, and eight climbers were missing today, officials said. `` The first information indicates that it is a group linked to the Peruvian Shining Path guerrillas,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s undersecretary of the interior. <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarachi </PERSON>, a Bolivian guide who was with the climbers and escaped to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that 16 men carried out the attack Monday on the camp about 15,000 feet above sea level. He said he heard shots fired but did not see any victims before escaping down a glacier. The Shining Path, which splintered off from the <ORGANIZATION> Peruvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 10 years ago, seeks to overthrow the Peruvian government and set up a Marxist state. The Peruvian government has said that since the group turned from propaganda to violence in May 1980, it has killed more than 15,000 people and caused more than $ 10 billion in damage. <PERSON> Guarachi </PERSON>, an experienced climber, said the guerrillas used walkie-talkies and that five wore khaki uniforms. He said the men made references to a Peruvian when they surrounded the camp, but he did not elaborate. Bolivian air force planes and helicopters today flew over the snow-covered mountains about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. Police said the aircraft found the camp but no evidence of the mountaineers. Guerrillas previously had not been reported operating in the Bolivian Andean region. The camp is surrounded by snow and mountain peaks, and no people live nearby. An American who was at a lower base camp and unaware of the attack returned to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> on Tuesday after the other climbers failed to show up. His name was not immediately available. One of the Canadians was identified as <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballom </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Officials did not release the names of the five Frenchmen and two Bolivians with the group. The travel agency Paititi, which handled the expedition, said the Frenchmen and Canadians were experienced mountaineers. Guarachi and the other Bolivians worked for Paititi.

<HEAD>Dutch Anti-Apartheid Activist Gets Five-Year Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Dutch activist was sentenced to five years in prison today for setting fire to two supermarkets and a <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> service station to protest <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid policy. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemersma </PERSON> argued that he was acting in defense of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 25 million blacks by setting fire to the facilities of Dutch firms doing business in that country. But the court ruled that no political motives were sufficient to justify such crimes. The attacks could `` easily have caused casualties,'' the court said in sentencing the 30-year-old protester. They also caused millions of dollars worth of damage. The fires at the two MAKRO supermarkets in <LOCATION> Duiven </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Duivendrecht </PERSON> prompted the owner of the stores to sell its South African factories.

Although <PERSON> Roemersma </PERSON> never admitted to membership, a group called Revolutionary Anti-Racist Action, or RARA, claimed responsibility for each of the attacks for which he was convicted.

 The space agency has invited proposals from industry for a $ 1.2 billion project to design, develop and test the next generation of booster rockets for the space shuttle. Firms have 60 days to submit their proposals. The first of the new rockets are to be placed into service in 1994, to be phased in over a three-year period. The contract award is expected early next year. A total of $ 1 billion is for design and developing the boosters and delivering six flight sets. An additional $ 200 million to $ 300 million is for construction of facilities on government-owned sites at <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stennis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, Miss.

 More than 1 million newborns will be tested for AIDS antibodies by the end of 1989 in a program federal researchers hope will give them a true picture of the spread of the disease in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The infants will be tested randomly and anonymously in the program, part of a $ 40 million package of initiatives to track the spread of the virus. The tests will determine only whether the mother is infected, Dr. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON> said Tuesday, and a positive result does not necessarily mean the child has or will get AIDS. <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON>, head of the sero-epidemiology branch of the AIDS program at the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> here, said some studies indicate 30 percent to 50 percent of newborns testing positive for the virus could eventually develop the disease. The program is intended to test a representative sample of the population to determine where AIDS infection among women is concentrated and to determine where to target prevention programs, <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON> said. `` So far it is concentrated in big cities. It is important to assess if it is prevalent in some rural areas as well,'' he said. `` Over time we will be able to monitor trends of infection in the female half of the general population.'' <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON> said plans for the tests are in place in 23 states plus <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and testing is already under way in about half of those. <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON> said he expects about 30 states to participate by year's end and more in 1989 Officials hope to test about 1.3 million infants, or one-third of all babies born, by the end of 1989, and continue testing at the same rate in succeeding years, <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON> said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune system, crippling its ability to ward off infection. The disease has killed more than 30,000 Americans. AIDS is carried in blood and other bodily fluids. It is most commonly transmitted by sexual contact or by shared, contaminated drug needles. It is also spread, less often, from an infected mother to her child before or at birth. The tests will conducted in addition to those routinely done on newborns for treatable conditions. No names will be attached to the blood samples, and consent from parents is not required, <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON> said. Otherwise, the random aspect of the sample would be tainted. `` Most groups involved in testing _ military recruits, sexually transmitted disease clinics, blood donors _ are to some extent self-selected,'' he said. `` People do not agree to take part who have some reason for not wanting to take part.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said the testing sites are expected to include <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>.

 Scientists did n't find the hot springs they were seeking on the floor of <LOCATION> Crater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, but a park official said the 17 dives in a one-person sub this month yielded valuable scientific information. <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> oceanographer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> made the final dive in the Deep Rover on Tuesday, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, chief ranger at Crater Lake National Park. The dives began Aug. 5 in the second year of a three-year study, funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, of the possible effect on the lake of hot springs, or hydrothermal vents, that may be the remnants of volcanic activity. The work is part of a larger 10-year study launched when the 1,932-foot-deep lake, the nation's deepest, began to lose some of its famous clarity. The scientists said earlier this month that nothing they have found so far could settle the question of whether proposed drilling for hydrothermal energy more than seven miles away would affect the lake. Although navigational difficulties precluded a precise search of the area where the hydrothermal activity was suspected, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said a variety of hydrothermal information was gathered. In addition, he said, `` A great deal of biological and geological information is going to be derived from the samples taken.'' Algae samples were taken as deep as 800 or 900 feet, he said, including some with forms of life never described before. In addition, a fish was sighted at 743 feet down. `` That's as deep as anyone has reported a fish in waters like that,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Crater Lake was formed when rain and melted snow filled the crater created when the top of a volcano collapsed nearly 7,000 years ago.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today opened a conference to review the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, and both sides linked progress at separate arms talks to the other side's compliance with the pact. The conference began today at the Soviet diplomatic mission, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shroeder </PERSON> said. He declined to give details. The first full meeting of both delegations, headed by Soviet disarmament official <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, was scheduled for Thursday. The conference is expected to last for one or two weeks. Under the ABM treaty, such meetings must be held every five years to give both sides a chance to list grievances. The ABM treaty allows each side to deploy only one ABM system and limits the types of systems that may be deployed. The theory for the agreement is that a potential aggressor would not launch a nuclear attack if it faced the prospect of devastating retaliation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has maintained a Soviet radar under construction at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, violates the treaty and must be dismantled. The Soviets contend the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Strategic Defense Initiative, a research program aimed at creating a space-based missile defense, violates the treaty and should be limited. According to an information sheet distributed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials recently told the Soviets that unless the radar is dismantled, no agreement is possible at negotiations on reducing strategic nuclear forces, or START. The START talks have been going on in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> since March 1985. Both sides agree in principle that strategic forces should be reduced by 50 percent. As a condition for the START agreement, the Soviets have for years demanded that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> limit its Strategic Defense Initiative. The ABM treaty review opened in a low-key atmosphere following earlier <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statements which hinted at a showdown over the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said this month that after hearing the Soviet position on <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> at the ABM conference, `` should the situation remain unresolved, the president will consult with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and our allies concerning next steps.'' One possible next step, according to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> information sheet, would be for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to declare the radar a `` material breach'' of the treaty. This would open the way for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to terminate or suspend the treaty and then go beyond its limits on the Strategic Defense Initiative. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation statement issued Tuesday did not speak of possible retaliatory action. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, in an arrival statement Saturday, said his side `` is prepared to discuss'' the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar. He said his delegation is `` ready to demonstrate in practice our consistent adherence to the ABM treaty.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will insist on `` the preservation of the ABM treaty intact as it was signed in 1972,'' he said, apparently alluding to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s position that the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> threatens the treaty.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of tourists packed their bags this morning and filed out of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>'s Canyon area, forced from the cabin development by flames from one of the park's 10 fires. Crews near <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, aimed to contain a 37,000-acre blaze by tonight; firefighters in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> tried to rein in a 750-acre fire on the slopes of the nation's deepest gorge in <LOCATION> Hells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, and a rash of wildfires broke out Tuesday in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, including a small blaze ignited by a plane crash that killed three. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, a finger of flame from a 91,700-acre fire in the park's western section edged to within 2 miles of the Canyon area, the largest development in the country's oldest national park. Park spokeswoman <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> said 306 tourists and as many as 275 staff members spent Tuesday night in the development, which also contains a visitors center, a general store and a campground. `` Nobody wanted to rattle beds and get people up. As the people are getting up this morning they will start going through checkout procedures, have breakfast this morning and then start leaving the Canyon area,'' said the spokesman. The fire, one of 10 in the park involving some 350,000 acres, was the only one to post major advances Tuesday despite winds gusting to about 30 mph. Low temperatures aided some 4,000 firefighters and 1,200 soldiers battling flames. Several other areas in the park are closed, including its Grant Village complex containing a campground, hotel, visitors center and staff dormitories. Many of the guests who had reserved spaces at Canyon's 600 cabins were moved to other park lodgings Tuesday night, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tedder </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s concessionaire. `` Everything has been very orderly,'' he said. `` This has almost become business as usual, as we've lived with it -LRB- the fires -RRB- for about seven weeks.'' Reservations are off about 25 percent this summer, <PERSON> Tedder </PERSON> added, almost certainly because of this year's fires, the worst in memory in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, 400 firefighters battled to keep a fire from moving over a ridge and into area with 12 million board-feet of timber the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> wants to sell. Firefighters at a 156,500-acre blaze in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s northeastern corner were aided Tuesday by about 600 soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. Another 600 <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> soldiers were to help clean up a 4,300-acre fire in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and adjacent Grand Teton National In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, winds Tuesday pushed a blaze away from the towns of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Silver Gate, officials said. In mountains southeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, nearly 3,000 firefighters gained a foothold in a two-week battle to contain the 37,600-acre fire that destroyed more than a dozen structures. `` There are no problems on the line that we've heard of, and we're still hoping for containment by 8 p.m.,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a fire information officer. In the west-central <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> LaPine </PERSON>, three families were briefly evacuated Tuesday night because of one of a series of small fires in the state. Lightning was blamed for at least 50 of the blazes. Near <LOCATION> Morton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, gusty wind and 100-degree temperatures allowed a forest fire to grow from 60 acres to 500 within a few hours Tuesday, officials said. The blaze burned mostly on land owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a timber firm.

So his selection of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> apparently says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> feels comfortable with someone from the right wing or wants to cater strongly to right-wing voters.

To repair the situation, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> needs to answer the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> question and others about his pre-political life, and to begin campaigning in more serious settings. He should get away from rally scenes that require him to shout political rhetoric and try other, smaller arenas where he can be seen and heard in ways that may inspire more confidence in his government skills.

Where he gets that figure is a mystery.

For babies born damaged, that bill is just a down payment on a lifetime of special needs. That, and the loss of a potentially productive citizen is the bill society pays for its neglect.

 ST-BASILE-LE-GRAND, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Police today kept about 3,000 residents from returning to their homes after thousands of gallons of oil laced with PCBs caught fire and released a poisonous black cloud. The warehouse fire broke out at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday and was extinguished after burning for more than six hours. Quebec provincial police sealed off a 1-by-5-mile corridor in this suburb across the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. Officials warned people in a wide area including eastern <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> not to eat vegetables from their gardens. `` So long as we are not 100 per cent certain that the soil, air and water are 100 per cent safe, we are not going to let people go back into their homes,'' said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s environment minister Technicians today examined the soil and water around <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> technician <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavoie </PERSON> said at least 50 residents were treated in hospitals for skin and lung irritation, but no serious injuries were reported. PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls, are fire-retardant chemicals that were used most often as insulating fluids or coolants in heavy-duty electrical equipment suchthe community using loudspeakers to order the evacuation. Residents spent the night in local schools. `` Until the results of our tests, we are telling people not to eat food from their gardens or drink tap water because 30 percent of their water comes from a lake in the contaminated area,'' <PERSON> Lavoie </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> fire director <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Therrien </PERSON> also advised residents of eastern <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> not to eat fruit and vegetables from their gardens until further notice. `` Because of the winds, the cloud of smoke from this fire spread over east-end neighborhoods during the night,'' <PERSON> Therrien </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jean-Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who lives near the warehouse, said he was outside with his wife when the fire started with an explosion. `` There was a black cloud about three stories high,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` I could feel it on my skin. It was very itchy.'' Other evacuees complained of sore throats, itchy skin and dizziness after inhaling the smoke. `` In two or three years, how many cancers will we have?'' said resident <PERSON> Lise </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, a St-Basile town councilor, said the warehouse, owned by <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, stored 500 barrels containing about 23,000 gallons of oil laced with PCBs. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Latulippe </PERSON>, who represents the area in the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> legislature and was among the evacuees, said the government had had trouble getting the warehouse to conform to environmental standards. `` The company had to be forced to take some measures to improve the safety of the site and some things were done,'' he said. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> said the government had threatened to suspend <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>'s permit unless the company adhered to its specifications and that <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> complied with most of the conditions The only plant in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> capable of destroying PCBs is in <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, but it does not accept <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> waste from other provinces.

 Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> began his first solo campaign trip today by ignoring the controversy over his Vietnam-era military service and instead urging creation of `` real jobs'' for millions of needy Americans. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator also told an audience of Midwestern state legislators that `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could stand a little bit of perestroika'' _ a reference to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of economic restructuring _ in the way it drafts the federal budget <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made only an oblique reference to the persistent controversy over his 1969 entry into the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and reports of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> golfing weekend he spent in 1980 with a female former lobbyist. `` Those of you thinking of running for vice president,'' he said, `` I want you to know that taking out your trash is a photo opportunity.'' It was while <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was taking out his trash at his <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, home in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburbs Tuesday that waiting reporters and cameramen pounced on him for comment about the controversy swirling around him. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> denounced the allegations as rumor, gossip and `` outright lies'' which were preventing him from showing the public how he intends to work with nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to promote <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> goals of `` jobs, peace, freedom.'' In his <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> speech, at the outset of his first foray alone on the campaign trail, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> sought to do just that. He stressed his support for a job training bill he co-sponsored in the early 1980s, which he said had created millions of jobs for women, minorities and disadvantaged workers. `` These are n't make-work, makeshift type of jobs,'' he said. `` They are real jobs.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also proposed that the federal budget be written every two years rather than going through the current laborious process every year in a crisis atmosphere. He said the budget process should be simplified, and the president should be given line-item veto authority to reject objectionable portions of legislation rather than requiring veto of an entire bill. From <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, where he had an airport encounter with his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had just addressed the same group of Southern state legislators that was waiting to hear from <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` I've warmed up the crowd for you,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` I hope you said good things about me,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to wish you that much good luck,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> replied. The two men laughed and shook hands. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was to speak to a national conference of enlisted <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> tonight. At home Tuesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he believed the Guard issue will fade during the campaign because Americans would rather hear about peace, jobs and freedom. As for new reports about his entry into the Guard and relationship with former lobbyist <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` This is just getting a little bit outrageous and I'm getting a little bit indignant about just one bum rap after another.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has denied using his family's influence to get into the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War, saying that the Guard had openings at the time. But a retired <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> guard official acknowledged Tuesday that he asked the Guard personnel office to `` hold'' a space for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> after receiving a call from a <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> family friend in 1969. Retired Major Gen. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON>, former military support officer for <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and later head of the state's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, said he was contacted by an old friend, <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON>, a retired Guard commander who then worked for a newspaper owned by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s family. `` <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> had called and said he had a good man, and said he thought he'd make a good Guardsman,'' <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. After learning there were a couple vacancies, `` I said hold one of them, there's a good guy coming over,'' he said. `` We could n't take him if there was n't any opening,'' <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was accepted into the state's headquarters unit, which was `` pretty selective'' and looked for recruits with intelligence and leadership potential. He said he `` paid attention'' to <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> because `` he was a former commanding general'' who would have an eye for who might make a good Guardsman. <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> received no preferential treatment during his service. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday an article in its November edition includes a statement from Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> propositioned her during a trip to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> eight years ago but that she rebuffed him because she was with another man. `` We flirted a lot and danced extremely close and suggestively,'' Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said in the Playboy interview. `` He said he wanted to make love.'' The release by <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> followed a report in the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> in which two former attorneys for Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> say she told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 about the alleged proposition. One of the attorneys, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s account was consistent with what Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> had told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made a pass at her, said he would like to sleep with her. She said, ` No, I'm with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>.''' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said, referring to former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Del., who went on the golfing trip to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1980 Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, then a representative, and a third congressman shared a cottage, and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> looked into the outing in an investigation into whether sexual favors were traded for votes against legislation. Officials dropped the case seven years ago without filing charges. `` I had nothing to do with her down there ...,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` I've got a wife and three small children, and I hope there's some respect and dignity for things I did not do before we go rushing off with all these so-called rumors.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who has been married since 1972, has said he did not have an affair with Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s grain production is expected to fall short of this year's government-set quota because of natural disasters and rising production costs, a newspaper reported Wednesday. The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily, quoting officials from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, said 28 million acres of farmland, about 10 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s total, have been hit by a severe drought. It said another 17.3 million acres have been inundated by floods. The report also said farmers were discouraged from planting grains by low government-set prices and high production costs. Agriculture experts predict the 1988 grain output will fall slightly short of this year's annual quota of 410 million tons. After a record 407 million tons were grown in 1984, grain output fell to 379 million tons in 1985, then edged back up to 402 million tons last year.

 Ten Soviets arrived Wednesday to carry out the last inspection of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile base before the end of a two-month inspection period under the superpower treaty to eliminate medium-and shorter-range nuclear weapons. The inspectors will stay at a hotel until they give official notice _ within a 48-hour period _ that they intend to visit the base in <LOCATION> Comiso </LOCATION>, in southeastern <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Italian officials, 112 Tomahawk cruise missiles are deployed in <LOCATION> Comiso </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Soviets were expected to fly to the base in an American military aircraft to <PERSON> Comiso </PERSON> on Friday. Under the terms of the treaty, the Soviets can take as long as 24 hours to inspect missiles, missile launchers and related equipment. They can request an eight-hour extension, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials can grant or refuse. The Soviets will be escorted by 10 Americans, including military officials, and by four Italian military officers and a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. At the end of the inspection, inspectors and escorts must exchange reports. During the 60-day inspection period, which ends at midnight Aug. 29, the Soviets had 30 sites to visit in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in five Western European countries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors had 133 sites to cover in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. Three of the Soviet inspectors had visited sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a fourth had inspected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Western European facilities. Previous Soviet inspections have taken place in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The treaty calls for the elimination within three years of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,400 miles. The head of the Soviet inspection team, <PERSON> Gennadiy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhailovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Komogortsev </PERSON>, said in his arrival speech that the aim of the visit is to verify that the number of missiles, launchers and other related equipment corresponds to details provided by the Americans.

 President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, who died in a plane crash that government officials suspect was caused by sabotage, had many enemies at home and abroad who wanted him out of power. Pakistani and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators searching the wreckage in eastern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of the president's C-130 transport plane have yet to report their findings on the crash Aug. 17 that killed the five-star army general, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and 28 others. Acting President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> has said the crash was a `` dastardly crime,'' but neither he nor any other official has indicated who is to blame. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> made many enemies in his 11 years as the iron-fisted leader of this nation of 107 million people in strategic central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. He also was surrounded by unfriendly governments in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> enraged the Moscow-backed, communist government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by providing strong support to Moslem insurgents fighting to overthrow <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was the conduit for the shipment of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> weapons to Afghan rebels who have been fighting a guerrilla war for nearly a decade. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, Afghan's president, sent a condolence message to <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> that referred to the crash only as an incident and did not mention <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> by name. A Western diplomatic source in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> reported Tuesday that <LOCATION> Khad </LOCATION>, the Afghan intelligence agency, and `` other -LRB- <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> -RRB- regime supporters spent the night of Aug. 17 celebrating President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s support of the Afghan rebels also angered the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has maintained troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since 1979 in support of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which is withdrawing its troops, repeatedly has said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is providing assistance to the insurgents in defiance of a U.N.-sponsored agreement reached this year to bring peace to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and its neighbor to the east, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, always have had tense relations and have fought three wars in 41 years. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> was particularly concerned about reports, which <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denied, that <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s government was developing an atomic bomb. But one Western diplomatic source, who demanded anonymity, noted that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on several occasions `` has indicated it could communicate with <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>.'' The source said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> equated the Pakistani leader with stability. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s enemies at home included political opposition leaders, religious minorities and groups seeking autonomy. <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, the main opposition leader who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has a personal grudge against <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>: He executed her father in 1979. Her father, <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, was a populist prime minister ousted in a 1977 military coup led by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was hanged two years later for alleged with conspiracy to murder a political opponent. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s party has been strongly critical of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, particularly his decision to forbid candidates from running as members of political parties in nationwide elections scheduled for November. Another significant political opponent of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, leader of the pro-Kabul <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Some members of the Moslem Shiite sect, which makes up 5 percent of the nation's population, disliked <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> for his religious and foreign policies. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, a member of the majority Sunni sect, was the driving force behind instituting Moslem law in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. But hard-line Shiites claimed the program did not take into account their form of jurisprudence. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s Shiites also disapproved of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s close ties to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has had icy relations with Shiite-led <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. An English-language newspaper, the Muslim of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, reported Monday that members of the minority sect blamed <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> for the death of a <ORGANIZATION> Pakistani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> leader who was assassinated Aug. 5 while leaving a mosque in the northwest frontier city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arif </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Hussaini </PERSON> headed an opposition political party, the <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurisprudence </ORGANIZATION>. More than 100 Shiites were arrested `` when they fired in the air to rejoice the deaths of -LRB- <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> -RRB- because they felt the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> government and the Americans had a hand in the murder'' of <PERSON> al-Hussaini </PERSON>, the newspaper said. Sectarian strife broke out in the northwest frontier, the paper said, when Shiites and Sunnis `` disputed whether to celebrate or mourn'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death. Shiite groups denied that such celebrations took place. Also dissatisfied with <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> were groups in the southern province of <LOCATION> Sind </LOCATION> who are seeking autonomy. The late president was from northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> province. Some Sindhis have sought more economic autonomy to build up their province, which includes some extremely undeveloped regions. They claim the province is not fairly treated because Punjabis dominate the federal government.

 Democratic vice president candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> today criticized Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> over a recent vote and questioned the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's readiness for high office, saying Americans ca n't risk `` youthful indiscretion'' in someone so close to the presidency. The 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> touted his own role in drafting jobs legislation as he sought to overcome the controversy that has plagued him in the week since he became <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up the formal endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and union president <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> took the opportunity criticize the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for favoring `` greed over need.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> with a joint campaign appearance on his schedule with a vacationing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s comment about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was his harshest to date, and it came in a speech to Southern legislators meeting in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, Ky. He said that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was one of 11 senators to vote earlier this year against legislation making the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> a Cabinet-level agency. Then, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Monday his vote was a `` youthful indiscretion'' and he had changed his mind. Said the 67-year-old <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator: `` A youthful indiscretion? My friends, that vote occurred only five weeks ago. `` I do n't think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can risk youthful indiscretion in someone who could become our president at any moment.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a World War II bomber pilot, also indirectly zinged <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service, saying `` some of the things that happened to me early on in combat make you grow up pretty fast.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> on the first stop of his first solo campaign tour since joining the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket, and he made only a wry comment about the furor surrounding his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. `` Those of you thinking for running for vice president, I want you to know that taking our your trash is a photo opportunity,'' he said in a reference to the reporters who greeted him with questions Tuesday morning as he dragged his trash barrels to the street. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said the Job Training and Partnership Act, which he helped draft in the early 1980s, had provided jobs for millions of workers, including women, minorities and the poor. `` This program is working. We have trained 3.4 million economically disadvantaged people in <LOCATION> Amnerica </LOCATION> so far, and there will be millions more,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s appearance in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> marked the latest in a string of attempts by the Republicans to shed the controversy that has plagued the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters on Tuesday his campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would get back on track `` whenever you stop asking me these questions.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told a crowd of supporters gathered in front of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> State Capitol in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>: `` I'm not going to let some insidious rumormongers drive me to change my mind. I'm standing behind <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is facing questions about his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> duty at the height of the Vietnam War, admission into law school and claims by former lobbyist <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> that he propositioned her eight years ago during a golf vacation in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with two other congressmen. Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazine she rebuffed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s advances during the vacation because she was there with then-U.S. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Republican `` We flirted a lot and danced extremely close and suggestively,'' Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> told the magazine about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, according to excerpts of the forthcoming article released Tuesday. `` He said he wanted to make love.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who represented Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> when she was questioned by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in 1981, said <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s account agreed with what she told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he had `` nothing to do with her,'' adding, `` This is just getting a little bit outrageous and I'm getting a little bit indignant about just one bum rap after another.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent Tuesday campainging in his home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, where he borrowed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s line about `` voodoo economics'' to criticize the vice president's budget plan. `` There is no Republican plan,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The vice president is talking about a flexible freeze. That's like a melting ice cube. ... That's the son of voodoo economics.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic proposals as `` voodoo economics'' in 1980 when the two were competing for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also questioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support for mandatory recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools, saying the vice president was unfit to run for president if he would sign such legislation after being told by a court that it was unconstitutional. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to enjoy post-convention gains in the polls. A new Gallup poll said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 48 percent to 44 percent, among registered voters. However, the survey had a margin of error of 3 percentage points, meaning that either figure could be off by that much. Gallup contacted 1,000 likely voters last weekend immediately following the Republican National Convention. There also were signs of progress being made on a debate schedule between the two presidential contenders, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> to meet with his counterpart in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, early next week to discuss arrangements. A new account of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s entry into the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> also surfaced. Retired Major Gen. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON>, former military support officer for <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and later head of the state's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, said he was contacted by an old friend, <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON>, a retired Guard commander who then worked for a newspaper owned by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s family. <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> that after <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> called him, he checked with personnel. `` They said they had a couple spaces,'' he said. `` I said hold one of them, there's a good guy coming over. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> insisted there was no influence applied, because `` when I applied there were openings and after I applied there were openings.'' One <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> report indicated that the Guard was overextended in mid-1969, but a month-by-month breakdown made available Tuesday showed that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s specific unit did have a handful of openings when he joined up in May, and in the months before and after. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is backing away from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s declaration that one of his `` missions'' as president would be to create 30 million new jobs in eight years, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoellick </PERSON>, senior economic adviser on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign staff, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used the figure in his acceptance speech for the Republican presidential nomination to express a general goal rather than to promise 30 million new jobs.

<HEAD>Military Families Move Inside Bases In Panama</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has reduced by 54 percent the number of military families living outside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> over the past five months, officials said Wednesday. The effort to move as many military families as possible inside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the troubled Central American nation has been aided by a growing number of servicemen deciding to accept so-called `` unaccompanied tours'' rather than bring families with them. Pentagon officials say they have no precise statistics available on that trend, but add that on-base housing has been freed up this summer at an unusual rate compared to years past, making it possible to move more families in from civilian homes. According to Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, there were 2,450 military families living off-post in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as of March 1. That number had been cut to 1,134 as of Aug. 1, and efforts are continuing to find space for as many more as possible, she said. `` We think we can do more,'' the spokeswoman said of the movements. `` There are clearly people choosing not to take their families to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and that helps free housing.'' Although the Pentagon has been working to move dependents to base housing for months, the effort has taken on more momentum this summer because of what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has described as a deliberate campaign of harassing Americans. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> reported last Sunday that Americans had reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by Panamanian authorities this year, including stoppage of mail and attempts to extort bribes for traffic violations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is continuing to press economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in a bid to oust military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is the home of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, the organization responsible for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. There are about 10,000 American servicemen stationed permanently in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, plus about 2,200 servicemen who have been assigned there on a temporary basis since spring to upgrade security at American bases.

 The National Guard these days is no good place to hide from a war. In the years since <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joined the Guard in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> in 1969, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oldest military organization has been made a full partner in the national defense with the regular Army. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> battle plan, which came to fruition in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, some <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> would be on the front lines in a war in just a few days, with most of the rest of Guard combat units to follow within 30 to 60 days. Some would reach the battlefield even before their regular Army counterparts. `` It was not but a few years ago that they said we could n't fight our way out of a wet paper bag, and here we're on the spearhead of an invasion,'' says Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the liaison with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` Baby, we've come a long way. And seeing the kids out there, I do n't know of any that say, ` Hell, no, I wo n't go.''' Even with the threat of being drafted no longer a factor _ conscription ended in 1972 _ the Guard is at its greatest strength in its 352-year history, with 451,900 soldiers in 2,043 units, greater even than during the Vietnam War. The militia that first fought for its homeland at <LOCATION> Bunker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and has fought in every <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> war has also emerged into an `` International Guard.'' Over the past few years half a million Guardsmen have trained overseas _ in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> went to court to block the dispatch of their states' Guardsmen to <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, but failed Under an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> battle plan called <ORGANIZATION> Capstone </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservists </ORGANIZATION> will comprise roughly half the manpower of the <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in event of war. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> can not go to war without the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and they recognize this,'' says Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` Today's Guard is considered a full partner with the active component in the Total Force.'' While the Capstone strategy was worked out in the late 1970s, it was not until the military buildup during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which once trained with hand-me-down weapons, was properly equipped. After the Vietnam War, many of the units were down to less than 65 percent of their authorized strength. The Guard now has units with the latest weaponry, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Abrams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M-1 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tank </ORGANIZATION>, the M-2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the <ORGANIZATION> Roland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> missile, and most units are at 90 percent or better of their authorized strength. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> received the new <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tank before the active component,'' <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> says. `` Now this sends a hell of a signal to that young man out there in the Guard as to his importance today.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is also at record strength, with 114,600 in 642 units. The <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, an advisory group for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, says that, among other things, the Air Guard is responsible for providing air defense on a daily basis for most of the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. It is solely responsible for the air defense of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` National Guard air defense units provide 78 percent of the air defense assets for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with two fighter-interceptors on 24-hour alert at each of 22 locations,'' says the board. Air Guard tankers provided air-to-air refueling for the strikes on <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` We were ready 10 years ago, but it was kind of a paper-thin combat readiness, whereas today the Air Guard is in basically the very same first-line equipment that the active <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is in _ F15s, F16s, brand new C-130s,'' says Maj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conaway </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. CW3 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> technician from <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, is a radar operator with <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 53rd Infantry Brigade, the `` Gator Brigade'' that is assigned to defend the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. He first joined the Guard 40 years ago at age 16 and saw combat in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` Brother, there ai n't no comparison between now and what it used to be,'' he says. `` We used to meet once a week and play cards. Now we hit the ground running.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is the only military organization of its kind in the world, with a dual role as a state militia and a federal defense force. Frequently called on to assist in emergencies such as natural disasters or riots, the Guard has been given more responsibility in helping curb drug traffic. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which traces its heritage to four militia regiments organized in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colony </LOCATION> on Dec. 13, 1636, has seen duty in every American war since the Pequot Indian War of 1637. The term `` National Guard'' was first used in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> militia unit on Aug. 25, 1824. Eighteen of the country's 38 presidents, from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> to <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, were members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> or the militias that were the Guard's predecessors. During World War I, the Guard supplied 17 combat divisions, 379,071 soldiers, or about 40 percent of the American Expeditionary Forces. The records of the German High Command noted that of the eight American divisions considered the best, six were <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> divisions. In World War II, of the first five <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> divisions to enter offensive combat, four were National Guard. Among the 300,034 Guardsmen who served in the war, 20 received Congressional Medals of Honor. In the Korean War, 183,600 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> were called to active duty. But of the 3.4 million American servicemen and women sent to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> during the Vietnam War, only 22,745 were Guardsmen. President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> felt large-scale call-ups of reservists for extended periods would lead to more public pressure to `` bring the boys home.''

 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s president lifted martial law today and said the ruling party would consider letting the people decide whether to return to multi-party democracy, state radio reported. `` General elections will be held as soon as possible'' if the people vote for a multi-party system in a referendum, and top government officials will not run in the elections, said President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. Hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters marched through <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital, a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat and news reports said. It was the third straight day of mass protest against <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s one-party government and the largest since military rule was imposed in 1962. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would meet Sept. 12 to consider holding a referendum on multi-party rule, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> reported in a broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. He said he and the 13 other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would step down if the party decided not to hold the referendum. If the party does agree to put the issue to the people, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would amend the Constitution at an emergency session the next day to pave the way for holding the referendum, the radio said. If elections are held, `` neither I nor any personnel of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justices </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorneys </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspectors </ORGANIZATION> will run,'' <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said Longtime strongman <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who toppled the elected government in 1962 and instituted authoritarian rule, proposed a referendum on multi-party rule in a speech to the party at an emergency session when he resigned July 23. Two days later, the proposal was rejected by party members who were `` attached to the one-party system,'' <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said today. The Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said today's demonstration `` attracted from several hundred thousand to up to 1 million'' people in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, a city of 3.5 million. `` They were marching and chanting `` Down with Socialism!'' and `` We Want Democracy!'' he said. Another Western diplomat, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said that <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> went today to see <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who still appeared to be pulling strings behind the scenes. Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> signed decrees lifting martial law in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and in Prome, a town 150 miles north of the capital. An order signed by Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Myo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> area commander, withdrew the military administration from the capital, it said. Former leader <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> imposed martial law on <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> on Aug. 3 after anti-government demonstrations. Ne Win imposed it on Prome on July 22 after mobs destroyed houses and shops there. No violence was reported in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> as demonstrators led by students and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks gathered in the morning outside <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, the main rallying place since troops shot medical personnel there during earlier rioting. Diplomats said demonstrators marched from the hospital past the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy for five or six hours. They dispersed peacefully after <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, daughter of independence leader Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, addressed them at the hospital. `` She urged calm and discipline and non-violence to bring about <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule,'' one Western diplomat said. `` They're calling for Friday to possibly be the biggest day ever, a general strike and huge demos.'' An <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat said <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> called for a united front against the government and a rally by 1 million people to demand full democracy. She lives in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> with her husband and is visiting <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. About 5,000 people sat outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy today listening to speeches over loudspeakers, the first Western diplomat said. `` The speakers have been writers, artists, lawyers, doctors and nurses,'' and the demonstrators sent frequent messages to the embassy asking for support, he said. Soldiers went to the embassy, `` but they were non-confrontational, staying behind barbed-wire barricades,'' he said. Troops also were at intersections and other areas. When the decree lifting martial law in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> was announced, the soldiers `` got on trucks and left. There was great cheering, clapping and blowing of horns,'' the diplomat said. He also cited reports that six demonstrators were shot and wounded by security personnel in <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION>, 45 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, but he had no details and the report could not be confirmed. Hundreds of thousands of people across <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> took to the streets from Aug. 8 to Aug. 12 to protest the transfer of power from Ne Win to <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, widely hated in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> for suppressing dissent. The government said clashes with security forces left 112 people dead and 267 wounded in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> alone. But diplomats say hundreds of people may have died in the protests before <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s resignation Aug. 12 after 17 days in power The new government has freed more than 600 people arrested during the rioting. Several prominent figures remain in custody, including <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s leading dissident, and Sein Win, the <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Nearly two decades after the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> rock festival became a symbol of peace and love for the Baby Boom generation, the music has been replaced by bickering over whether there should be an anniversary concert. Promoters are squabbling. Neighbor is pitted against neighbor and bucolic <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> is still trying to come to grips with its place in history. `` This town does n't want to forget it,'' said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>'s supervisor. `` The town just does n't want to get into the same thing it got into 20 years ago.'' <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON>'s old farm, where 300,000 people converged for three days in August 1969 to hear musicians like the Who, <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, Stills, <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, is n't a tourist trap, largely because many people still think it's in <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, 45 miles away. The only clue along Route 17B is a small wooden sign advertising the `` <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> Camp Ground'' that points down narrow <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> <PERSON> Road </PERSON>. About a mile down the road is a large, sloping field, empty except for a concrete and steel plaque that identifies its historic past. `` Every year more and more people have been assembling at the site. It's virtually become a shrine,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, lawyer for the current owners of <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON>'s Farm, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> auto glass shop owner <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelish </PERSON>. The Nickys offered the town $ 200,000 for the right to be host for another concert in the summer of 1989. <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> would have to waive its ordinance forbidding gatherings of more than 10,000 people, passed in 1970. No thanks, said the town board. `` I walked through it. Besides the drugs, there were sex orgies all over the place,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuhaus </PERSON>, town supervisor during the original festival. `` I'm 100 percent against -LRB- another concert -RRB- and I will do everything I can to prevent it.'' Other townspeople are n't so harsh. `` Of course there was a lot of noisy music and nude people, but there were a lot of good things too,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassmer </PERSON>, who runs a general store that sold supplies to famished concertgoers 19 years ago. The small community two hours from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, surrounded by farms and out-of-the-way vacation homes, simply ca n't handle large crowds, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. The supervisor said he's heard from `` five or six'' promoters about an anniversary concert. One even offered to pay for a new sewage and water system for <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said that after he asked the promoter to post a letter of credit he never heard from him again. <PERSON> Gelish </PERSON> said the people blocking a concert are simply old-fashioned. `` My husband worked hard all his life, he never had a chance to be famous,'' <PERSON> Gelish </PERSON> said of 61-year-old <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON>. `` This is his chance to be famous.'' <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON>, who allowed promoters to hold the concert on his farm, died of a heart attack in 1973 at age 54. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenman </PERSON>, one of the four promoters of the original concert, says the Nickys, who bought the property seven years ago, just want to cash in on a piece of history they had nothing to do with. <PERSON> Rosenman </PERSON>, not coincidentally, wants to promote his own series of commemorative concerts, but somewhere other than the Catskills. <PERSON> Gelish </PERSON>, who vows to continue fighting for a concert, said she has no other plans for the land. Asked if she could envision a tourist attraction with the magnitude of Graceland, <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s home, her eyes lit up `` This is really hallowed ground,'' she said. Back at the site one afternoon, a man in a tie-dyed T-shirt and dirty jeans sat cross-legged in the field. A grey-haired man took video pictures of trees and tall grass swaying in the wind. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> drove up, his <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> license plates reading `` WOODSTCK.'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, who works at a bank in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, did n't attend the original show but drives up each summer because `` it's a nice feeling around here.'' Speaking above the blare of 1960s hits from his radio, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said he's ambivalent about a <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> anniversary concert. `` If it happens it would be fine,'' he said, `` but I do n't think it would ever be the same.''

<HEAD>Court Cites `Special Relationship' In Woman's Suit Against Police</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court, reinstating a suit by a woman who claims she was terrorized by her husband, said police may have a special responsibility to protect a person who obtains a restraining order against another. The decision Tuesday by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be the first appellate ruling to allow a suit against police for harm caused by violation of a restraining order. The woman, <PERSON> Jena </PERSON> <PERSON> Balistreri </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pacifica </LOCATION>, said in her suit that officers derided her complaints about her husband's violence and failed to help her. Restraining orders _ which generally forbid a person to approach, contact or harass someone else _ have become common in domestic violence cases. The restraining order in the <PERSON> Balistreri </PERSON> case may have been `` an affirmative state commitment to protect -LRB- the woman -RRB- from her husband's harassment,'' said Judge <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> in the 2-1 decision. `` While there is, in general, no constitutional duty of -LRB- police -RRB- to protect members of the public at large from crime, such a duty may arise by virtue of a ` special relationship' between -LRB- police -RRB- and a particular member of the public.'' A special relationship is found most often when the plaintiff is in custody and claims a duty by authorities to provide protection from harm. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said such a relationship may be created when a plaintiff secures a protective order and tells officers she is still being harassed. In dissent, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON> said a restraining order created no legal right to police protection, at least without proof that the order had been violated. He also asked whether the court was conferring `` preferred status'' on some citizens. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a lawyer for police in <LOCATION> Pacifica </LOCATION>, declined comment on the ruling. Ms. <PERSON> Balistreri </PERSON> said she got a restraining order against her husband in 1982 prohibiting him from contacting her after he beat her severely and after he apparently committed vandalism and made hundreds of harassing phone calls. After the order was issued, she said, he crashed his car into her garage, and a firebomb was thrown through her window. She said police refused to arrest him and suggested after the firebombing that she move or hire a private investigator. She also said police responded to her complaints with ridicule and refused to investigate harassing phone calls she got between 1983 and 1985. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Conti </PERSON> had dismissed the suit against the <LOCATION> Pacifica </LOCATION> police and Chief <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, saying police had not violated Ms. <PERSON> Balistreri </PERSON>'s rights.

 A <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> police officer has been charged with kidnapping and armed robbery in incidents two other officers were suspected of earlier, authorities said. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crite </PERSON>, 20, was arraigned Tuesday on charges of kidnapping, armed robbery and use of a firearm in commission of a crime, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hair </PERSON> said. Magistrate <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammons </PERSON> Sr. ordered him held on $ 100,000 bond pending a Sept. 2 preliminary hearing. <PERSON> Crite </PERSON>, on the department for two years, was identified Tuesday by three victims as one of two uniformed men who robbed them Aug. 16 after stopping them with a patrol car, police said. If convicted of either kidnapping or armed robbery, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Investigators are looking into complaints that two uniformed men driving a patrol car robbed at least 10 people Aug. 15 and Aug. 16. Two other officers detained in the case last week were suspected because a patrol car they used the afternoon of Aug. 15 was reported missing and believed used in the robbery spree. They were released after victims failed to identify them in a lineup. Department spokesmen declined comment on <PERSON> Crite </PERSON>'s arrest.

 About 150 parents toured a specially built glass booth where an AIDS-stricken girl is to be quarantined during class, but many remained concerned that their children could catch the deadly virus. `` If <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> comes here, my daughter wo n't,'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> declared Tuesday, referring to the mentally retarded 6-year-old who is to attend the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exceptional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> under federal court order. `` There's too much unknown to say AIDS is not a communicable disease,'' he said. `` I'm sorry she has the disease, but why put all the other children in jeopardy?'' Earlier this month <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> could attend classes with other children but must stay in the 6-by-8-foot enclosure outfitted with a toilet and sink until she becomes toilet-trained and stops sucking her fingers.

 Authorities in the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area have joined forces to search for a man believed to have sexually assaulted at least 22 women at apartment complex swimming pools since May.

The suspect then usually orders victims to run away while he steals the swimsuits. Police Lt. K.L. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> said authorities will have their third joint meeting this week. Farmers Branch Dectective <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemons </PERSON> described the man as active and persistent. He said when the man has been unsuccessful in assaulting one woman, he has approached as many as three others in different cities in as many hours. Officials said the joint investigation has tracked details of the suspect's movements. `` The guy is most active on Mondays and Wednesdays, and between the hours of noon to about 4 p.m., but he has varied the days and hours on a few occasions,'' Lemons said. `` Besides having an outdoor fetish, he likes knowing that the police are close behind him.''

<TEXT>
 Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up organized labor's endorsement today, criticized the Reagan-Bush record on creating jobs and said the nation needs `` an economic leader, not a cheerleader'' for president. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for failing to mention budget and trade deficits in his acceptance speech at the GOP National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> last week. `` And to add insult to injury,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> union presidents, `` he wants to cut taxes for the wealthy again. You know, if this was a movie it would be called ` Son of Voodoo'.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that while more Americans are working today than at any time in history, the majority of jobs created under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have paid poorly. He said the average weekly wage for jobs lost between 1979 and 1985 was $ 440, while the average wage of replacement jobs was one-third less. `` That's the price American workers and families are paying for eight years of voodoo economics,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, borrowing a phrase that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself once used to describe <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic policies. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> formally endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president, as expected, with federation president <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> charging that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` has favored greed over need'' for the past eight years. The giant labor federation's endorsement of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was nearly unanimous. Of its 91 affiliated unions, only the 30,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the 40,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the 1.6-million <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union abstained from the vote. `` The Reagan-Bush administration came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> charging that government itself was the problem,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. `` Eight years later we know that government is not the problem. The problem lies with those who govern. This is an administration that has favored greed over need.'' Teamster President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said his union had not polled its members but is doing so through its monthly magazine. Teamster officials said they expect to announce an endorsement in mid-September. The airline pilots said their board of directors had not met on the issue, and the marine engineers said they were following a long tradition of not making presidential endorsements. The Newspaper Guild cast 21,390 votes or approximately 80 percent of its membership in favor of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but abstained on 4,000 votes in the membership-weighted tally. Guild President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> said the partial abstention reflected the policy of the union's <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> local in `` disassociating itself from any political endorsements.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> flew here from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to address the labor federation later today, after reviving Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` voodoo economics'' line to criticize the vice president's own budget plan. Then <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned two days of campaigning in the big industrial states of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor spent Tuesday wrapping up his annual trip to his state's northeast communities, but he took time to deliver some of his harshest criticism to date of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his Republican rival. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s flexible-freeze budget plan `` the son of voodoo economics.'' It was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who, during his 1980 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary campaign, referred to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic proposals as `` voodoo economics.'' The governor also questioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support for mandatory recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools, saying the vice president was unfit to run for president if he would sign such legislation after being told by a court that it was unconstitutional. In addition, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reiterated that he was eager to debate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and there was an indication some progress was being made on that issue. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> was to meet with his counterpart in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, early next week to discuss a debate schedule. `` There is no Republican plan'' to erase the federal deficit, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said after telling newspaper editors he would balance the budget within five years by holding the line on defense spending, cutting some domestic spending and collecting unpaid taxes. `` The vice president is talking about a flexible freeze,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` That's like a melting ice cube. ... That's the son of voodoo economics.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also lashed back at criticism from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Republicans who have attacked his 1977 veto of state legislation that penalized teachers who refused to lead their students in the Pledge of Allegiance. The governor vetoed the measure after the state's highest court, citing <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> precedent, advised him the legislation was unconstitutional. `` I encourage children to say the Pledge of Allegiance,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I say the Pledge of Allegiance. That's not the issue. The Republicans know it. ... That law was unconstitutional. `` If the vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is saying that if he was president and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the law was unconstitutional and the attorney general said it was unconstitutional and he'd have signed it anyway, well, that raises very serious questions about what it means to take the oath of office,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` You are under a constitutional oath to veto the bill, are n't you? he said. `` Is the vice president suggesting something else? Is he suggesting he'd sign the bill anyway, having been informed by the highest court of the land that it was unconstitutional? If he does that, he has no business running for this office.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for failing to challenge the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> court's advisory opinion. `` Courts rule on constitutionality, not governors,'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said. `` The point is if he felt strongly on the issue, he could have challenged it in court and he decided not to do that.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also applauded President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for signing major trade legislation Tuesday, but said Democrats deserved credit for the measure. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was quick to point out that his running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, was the co-sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill. `` He was the architect of it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Officials of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said Thursday they are willing to resume talks on sharing next month's Olympics and a non-aggression pact. But there was no clear agreement: <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> suggested meeting on Thursday and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> proposed a session on Friday. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> said their chief delegate, <PERSON> Prk </PERSON> <PERSON> Joon-kyu </PERSON>, met privately with his North Korean counterpart, <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol </PERSON>, at the truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> Wednesday. Later in the day, <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> telephoned <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> to suggest reopening talks Friday. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said in a radio broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> that its delegation had proposed meeting on Thursday. Park refused to disclose details of Wednesday's meeting. He did say he expected `` new proposals'' from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, but he admitted he was not encouraged by Wednesday's meeting. Assembly officials were reluctant to predict whether the deadlocked talks could be revived. But one senior official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said, `` Neither side wants to take the blame.'' <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials say they believe <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> does not expect a dramatic breakthough. Instead, they think <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> is trying to distract world attention from the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since their peninsula was divided at the end of World War. The current round of talks, which began Aug. 19, ended in a stalemate Monday. South Korean delegates said then they hoped to pospone further contacts until after the Olympics. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had called for urgent talks on sharing the Olympics, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials said they were not so enthusiastic about pursuing the subject when the face-to-face meetings began. The North Koreans seemed more concerned about a non-aggression pact, they said. These preliminary talks broke up over such basic issues as the agenda and the number of participants for later negotiations proposed for the two parliaments. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> insists the main talks include the full legislatures of both sides, which would involve nearly 1,000 people. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> wants delegations of up to 30 lawmakers from each side. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> also wants the two parliaments to publish a joint declaration of non-aggression calling for the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, as well as removal of the nuclear weapons allegedly in their arsenal. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> sees the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces as vital to its defenses. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it would boycott the Olympics unless it can be a co-host. The International Olympic Committee rejected the North Korean demand, saying that the Olympics are given to a single city and can not be shared.

 Organs found floating in the city sewer treatment plant are believed to be human, but should not pose a public health threat, officials said Wednesday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today it was `` shocked'' by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s decision to expel 25 Palestinian activists, and a senior diplomat said that relations between the two countries might be damaged if the expulsions continue. The warning was conveyed Monday by Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s charge d'affaires <PERSON> Oded </PERSON> <PERSON> Eran </PERSON>, said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> source, declining to be further identified. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON> confirmed the meeting took place but declined to discuss its contents. Eran, who is in charge of the embassy while Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> is on vacation, was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> announced it would expel 25 Palestinians accused of fueling the violence which has claimed more than 250 Palestinian lives in the past eight months. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> `` was emphatic about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position that it objects to these expulsions,'' said the source. `` He said relations could be damaged if this goes on,'' the source added. `` We are shocked by the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s decision to expel an additional 25 Palestinians,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. She said that if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carries out the deportation orders, it will bring to 60 the number of Palestinians expelled this year from the Israeli-occupied territories. The expulsions can be appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, although all the orders have been upheld this year. The growing number of expulsions appears to indicate that deportations `` are the norm rather than the exception,'' she added. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> contends that it uses expulsions only as a last resort to ensure public order is maintained in the territories. It has accused those expelled of fueling the Palestinian uprising that began last December. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> argues that it is entitled to deport Palestinians in accordance with international law governing occupying powers, as well as under British emergency laws applied by the government in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. But Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> repeated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view that deportations are not legal under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> human rights accords, which govern the conduct of occupying powers, and called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to charge and try Palestinians rather than expel them. Expulsions only exacerbate the situation and increase tensions between <LOCATION> Israelis </LOCATION> and Palestinians, she said. Nonetheless, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> reaffirmed the strong ties between the two countries, saying `` our friendship and close association with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> continue.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the largest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid, getting $ 3 billion annually in economic and military support funds.

<HEAD>Superpowers Open Review Conference on ABM Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA WATSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A U.S.-Soviet conference reviewing the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty opened Wednesday after both sides linked progress at separate weapons reduction talks to full compliance with the ABM accord. Superpower delegates held two meetings Wednesday, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shroeder </PERSON>. He said he had no details of what was discussed. The first full meeting, or plenary, of both delegations is scheduled for Thursday at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic mission. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation is headed by Maj. Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and the Soviet side by top disarmament official <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>. The conference is the third such meeting held since the ABM treaty went into effect. Under the accord, such meetings must be held every five years. The ABM treaty restricts each side to deploying only one ABM system, comprising a radar and anti-ballistic missiles. The aim is to prevent either side from creating a full nationwide protective network under the theory that neither would launch a nuclear attack if it feared devastating retaliation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains that a Soviet radar under construction in <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, violates the treaty because it is not located on the periphery of the country, facing outward, as the treaty stipulates that missile tracking radars must be. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has also voiced concern at Soviet deployment last year of two other radars in <LOCATION> Gomel </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, saying they also violate the treaty. An information sheet distributed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials recently told the Soviets that unless the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar is dismantled, no agreement is possible at separate negotiations on reducing strategic, or intercontinental, nuclear forces. This was apparently the first time the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side made such a linkage. The Soviets have for years linked progress in the strategic weapons negotiations to limits on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's space-based missile defense system The Soviets have said that some research on the system, officially known as the Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly called `` Star Wars,'' violates the ABM treaty, but their public statements have not made clear where they draw the line. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has rejected the Soviet call for limits on the program. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said early this month that the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aim at the review conference would be to get the Soviet side to `` correct its violations of the ABM treaty.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that if the Soviet position on <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> does not change at the review conference, `` the president will consult with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and our allies concerning next steps.'' <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, the Soviet delegation chief, said upon arrival Saturday that his side is prepared to discuss the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar. He said the Soviets were `` ready to demonstrate in practice our consistent adherence to the ABM treaty.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will insist on `` the preservation of the ABM treaty intact as it was signed in 1972,'' he said, apparently referring to the Soviet position that the `` Star Wars'' program threatens the treaty.

 A federal jury today convicted a man of burning an American flag outside an armed forces recruiting station during a demonstration. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a 22-year-old member of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, could receive up to a year in prison. No sentencing date was set. He remained free on $ 1,000 bond. <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> testified Tuesday that he set fire to the flag in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> in March to show his discontent with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to send troops to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> `` I do n't necessarily agree with what my government was doing, but that does n't make me less of an American or less of a patriot,'' said <PERSON> Cary </PERSON>, who at the time of his arrest worked in a used clothing store. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the act was a show of contempt for the flag. `` This case is not about political beliefs,'' he told the jury. `` There are ways one can be legally contemptuous,'' he said. `` One can stand on a podium and shout or sing. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has said that for certain reasons you ca n't be contemptuous of the flag.'' <PERSON> Cary </PERSON>, dressed in garb made from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag, was arrested during a large protest in which demonstrators used bowling balls and rocks to break windows at the recruiting office. He was charged with burning a flag in public. <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> testified that a woman he did n't know handed him one end of a flag she was carrying and asked for his help in burning it. He said he used his own lighter and he and the woman laid the burned flag in front of the recruiting office doorway. `` It seemed like an appropriate gesture,'' he testified. `` I knew there were cameras there. I knew I could get people's attention that way. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said proceedings are under way to expel <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, of which he has been a member since age 18.

 A federal judge ordered the city to return a black boy to his white foster parents, saying that deciding the child's placement on non-racial grounds will encourage treatment of people as individuals. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannum </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that 5-year-old <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullard </PERSON>, now living with the Rev. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>, who are black, should be returned to the home of <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. The child lived with the <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION> between age 5 months and 2 -LCB- years. `` Deciding <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>'s placement, not on the basis of his race, but on the quality of his relationships, will advance the strong public interest in overcoming racial discrimination and will promote the goal that citizens be treated according to their individual human qualities,'' <PERSON> Hannum </PERSON> wrote. The judge said the youngster received quality care from both sets of foster parents, but he concluded the boy had become emotionally tied to the <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION>, became depressed after being removed from their care and would suffer irreparable harm if not returned to them. `` It is evident that use of race as a sole criterion in making proper long-term foster care placements of black foster children is inadequate,'' <PERSON> Hannum </PERSON> wrote. `` Factors such as the ability of foster parents, black or white, to care for the child, to provide a safe, secure and stable home to the child, etc., must be examined in making determinations of this kind.'' Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said she was `` tickled pink'' by the decision. `` Just to have him home in our arms, what else can we tell you?'' <PERSON> Willliams </PERSON> said he did not believe it was in <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>'s best interest to be moved again. He said the child was well adjusted and was part of his family. He said he and his wife wanted to discuss the ruling with their attorney before deciding whether to appeal. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> was placed with the <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 by <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit foster care agency under contract to the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said the placement would be for six months, then the boy would be returned to his natural mother. But his mother, who had emotional problems, was deemed not ready to resume caring for the child at the end of the six months, and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> remained with the <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> family. In 1985, however, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> advised the department that <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> should be removed from the <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION> and placed with a black family to comply with the city agency's policy. The child subsequently was placed with the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a board member of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency told him they had viewed <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>'s placement with the <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION> as short-term care and the boy's placement with the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> as a long-term solution. `` There's no set policy'' on placing children with foster parents of a different race, said <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Durkin-Asti </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archdiocese, which runs <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` We match children to families according to who is best able to help the child. Each case is individual.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied it used race as the sole factor in placing <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Hannum </PERSON> disagreed, and said using race as the sole criterion was unconstitutional. He granted the injunction the <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION> requested, directing the department to submit a plan to return the child to the <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION> within two months. The judge said the evidence showed the boy would benefit from returning to the <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> home and would be harmed psychologically if not returned. The judge added, however, the plan should give the boy contact with the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Hannum </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> McLaughlins </ORGANIZATION> live in a racially integrated neighborhood and had pledged to the court that <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> would attend a racially integrated school near their home. `` This court is satisfied that <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> ... will have every opportunity to develop a positive sense of racial identity.''

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Shrank 15 Percent In Second Quarter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit shrank 14.9 percent from April through June, helped by a record high level of exports and the first quarterly decline in imports in three years, the government reported Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the difference between what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> spends and sells abroad narrowed to a deficit of $ 29.9 billion in the second quarter, compared to a deficit of $ 35.2 billion in the first three months of 1988. That was the biggest quarterly improvement in more than five years, and continued a trend which began after the deficit hit a record $ 41.2 billion in the October-December quarter. For the first six months of this year, the trade deficit, on a balance of payments basis, has been running at an annual rate of $ 130.2 billion, down almost 20 percent from the record $ 160.3 billion deficit suffered in 1987. Some economists are predicting the trade deficit will drop by close to 25 percent for the year as a whole, marking the first annual improvement since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office. `` We have had a very good six months for trade. It has taken a long time, but the trade deficit is finally turning around,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. Democrats have tried to make the country's soaring trade deficits in the 1980s a campaign issue, but Republicans are hoping the voters will focus instead on this year's improvement, which has made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing one of the standouts of the economy. The new figures confirmed an improvement already evident in the department's monthly merchandise trade reports. Those figures showed the trade deficit declining 12.8 percent to $ 32.6 billion in the second quarter, compared to $ 37.4 billion in the first quarter. Wednesday's figures are smaller because they subtract such factors as shipping costs and military sales from the monthly numbers. The new report said that imports edged down 0.8 percent to $ 109.6 billion in the April-June quarter, the first quarterly decline since the first three months of 1985. While imports of petroleum products were up by 2.6 percent to $ 10.2 billion, non-oil imports fell 1.1 percent, reflecting a big drop in car shipments as Americans began to balk at higher sticker prices caused by the weaker dollar. Foreign car imports from countries other than <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> fell by 12 percent in the second quarter, led by a 25 percent decline in shipments from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. South Korean car shipments fell by 19 percent while Japanese car imports were down 7 percent. Average prices for German cars shot up 21 percent in the second quarter while the average price of Japanese cars rose by 3 percent. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports climbed 5.8 percent to a record $ 79.7 billion in the second quarter, reflecting in part a 48 percent surge in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft sales. Agricultural exports were up as well, climbing 7 percent to $ 9.7 billion, the highest level since the second quarter of 1984. Corn sales climbed 27 percent, with much of the gain attributed to increased sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Wheat sales were up 10 percent due to an increase in sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> while meat and poultry shipments rose 28 percent, largely due to increased Japanese purchases. Soybean and wheat prices both rose 13 percent while corn prices were up 7 percent. Analysts said even larger price increases would be seen in coming months since the spring advance did not reflect the impact of the summer drought. The trade deficit decreased with every major geographic area except for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the country's largest trading partner, where the imbalance climbed by $ 500 million to $ 4.1 billion. The country's largest deficit, as usual, was with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an imbalance of $ 11.9 billion, down $ 1.1 billion from the first quarter. The deficit with Latin American decreased $ 1.5 billion to $ 1.7 billion while the deficit with <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> fell $ 900 million to $ 3.8 billion. The deficit with the newly industrialized countries of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> declined $ 700 million to $ 6.1 billion.

 <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, whose sexual liaison with <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> led to the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> evangelist's downfall, has signed a 30-day contract to work as an on-air personality at a radio station here, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> announced today. Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> will begin work Monday as part of the morning team of announcers at <LOCATION> KOY-FM </LOCATION>, the Top 40 station said through an advertising agency. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the agency, would not disclose terms of the contract. However, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said that Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> was signed to a 30-day contract with an option to renew and that the deal included housing and `` very adequate'' compensation. Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> appears in the current issue of Playboy, which includes nude photographs of her following breast-enlargement and other cosmetic surgery. KOY-FM ranks near the bottom in audience share for metropolitan <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and has played elaborate pranks in its search for publicity. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said the offer to Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> was made because `` people tend to like her on the air.'' `` Obviously, there's publicity value involved, but it's mostly for the station,'' he said. `` She does n't need publicity. All she has to do is walk down the street if she wants publicity.''

 A father whose children repeatedly have been suspended from school for preaching at its gates has not ruled out legal action against the system, which has agreed the young evangelists can be taught at home. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday his children _ <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, 11, Pepper, 7 and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, 6 _ will be removed from <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. But he said he will not sign a document releasing the system from possible legal action. `` <LOCATION> McDowell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools rejected the Bible, so I reject them,'' he said. Strode, himself a street preacher, said he and his children will continue preaching, although he said he expects the town `` to take some kind of action'' in response. `` They're trying to shut me down,'' he said. Under <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> law, Strode has 30 days to set up a home-education plan. Strode, 40, an unemployed machinist, had said he did n't want to run a home school, but he said Wednesday it appeared to be the only solution. `` I'm just glad they -LRB- the children -RRB- are out of there,'' he said. The children are happy with the decision, <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said. `` The problem ai n't the kids,'' he said. `` It's the parents and the teachers. It's hard to fool kids. Parents' hearts are much harder. An adult's conscience is much harder than a child's.'' The decision to take the children out of school came after daylong negotiations between school officials and <PERSON> Caleb </PERSON> <PERSON> Campaign </PERSON>, a Chicago-based Christian civil rights organization representing the <LOCATION> Strodes </LOCATION>. `` We pretty much got what everybody wanted,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodden </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Caleb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rodden </PERSON> said his organization would help with the home education program and even help Strode find a job. The Strode children's first day of school Monday lasted less than a minute and ended with <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> being suspended for 10 days. At the school gate, <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> began to shout Bible verses and Pepper yelled `` Repent.''

<TEXT>
 Strikers closed down the last section of the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> port today and a convoy of more than 60 police vehicles and water cannons headed toward the city along the main road from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. About 1,000 workers went on strike today at the <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> steelworks outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, where a strike attempt fizzled after a few hours Monday, said worker leader <PERSON> Maciej </PERSON> <PERSON> Mach </PERSON>. A police raid ended a major strike at the 30,000-worker mill in May. Riot police smashed barricades to break up a strike at a southern coal mine and cleared strikers from an idled bus depot in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. Two coal mines ended strikes peacefully, but opposition sources said a coal mine and a cement factory joined more than a dozen workplaces on strike. Confronted by an 8-day-old series of job actions posing the stiffest challenge to its rule since 1981, the Politburo urged <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members `` to counter attempts to stir illegal strikes,'' the state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The stoppages have idled coal mines and factories employing about 100,000 workers. The strikers demand legalization of the Solidarity trade union movement, reinstatement of workers fired for union activity and wage increases. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the Politburo also decided to convene an extraordinary meeting of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` in the nearest future.'' Section 2 of the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> port, a cargo-loading division that was the only one in the city still working, joined the strikes today, government and opposition spokesmen said. Near <LOCATION> Elblag </LOCATION>, about 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, a long column of police vehicles assembled along the main highway leading to <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, said Western reporters driving to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, taking part in a strike since Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, rallied today with strikers there and at two nearby shipyards. `` It is you, the young people, who will renew Solidarity and renew the country,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> exhorted youthful strikers at the Repair Shipyard, according to a tape of the rally given to reporters. In <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, police today routed strikers from a bus depot, said <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalczyk </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Factory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port. Polish television showed sullen bus drivers quietly marching away from the depot after a police commander said his men would use force if they remained. It did not show police using force. On Monday, police raided three depots around the city and arrested strikers, and only one depot remained on strike today. Army troops continued to operate some buses. Police evicted 150 strikers from the <LOCATION> Miesko </LOCATION> mine in the <LOCATION> Silesian </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Walbrzych </LOCATION> in an assault Tuesday evening, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Government spokesman <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> said a group of `` party activists, management and workers'' accompanied by police intervened to end the strike, and he denied that police played an active role. But at another mine in the <LOCATION> Silesian </LOCATION> coal fields, about 125 miners Tuesday blocked themselves 580 yards underground in a shaft near the curfew-bound southern town of <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>. The miners pledged to stay underground at the 30 Years of People's <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> mine `` until the end of their lives, until all the demands are met,'' said <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Maziarski </PERSON>, a Solidarity spokesman in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, strikes ended peacefully at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> Myslowice </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> Walbrzych </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. But <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Knurow </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> Gliwice </LOCATION> in the south and the Dzialoszyn cement works in <LOCATION> Wielun </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> joined the strikes today. <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> said he had no information on the strikes. In another development, <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>, a former underground Solidarity leader, made a dash for his motorcycle during the night and escaped police watchers stationed outside his Warsaw-area home since Sunday, said his wife <PERSON> Waclawa </PERSON>. The Politburo issued a communique saying speedy changes must be made to correct the country's economic policies. The government has raised prices 40 percent this year and wages have lagged far behind inflation. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said at least 49 people have been detained in connection with the strikes. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appealed again Tuesday for dialogue with authorities to end the strikes, but the government, which has declared the strikes illegal, refused. Communist authorities stifled Solidarity in a December 1981 military crackdown, and it was outlawed the following year. `` There will be no political talks under the ` pistol' of a strike,'' Urban told a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> news conference. He did not rule out declaring a state of emergency in the affected provinces: `` The measures that will be applied will be adequate to developments.'' Urban said a special <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> commission will meet Aug. 31 to review the government's economic policies. Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> announced Monday that troops would be sent to secure major industrial plants, though none were in evidence at the plants on Tuesday. An 11 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew was imposed Tuesday in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, the country's industrial and mining heartland and site of many of the mine strikes. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> also authorized curfews in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> provinces on the Baltic coast, but none were declared. Four columns of army and police vehicles left <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> on Tuesday for Katowice, witnesses said. On the road in <LOCATION> Oswiecim </LOCATION>, near the entrance to the coal-rich <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> region, army roadblocks stopped cars and searched them.

 The death toll from the Himalayan earthquake topped 750 on Wednesday as rescue workers hampered by monsoon rains, aftershocks and washed out roads reached remote areas of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and found more bodies. In eastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which also was devastated by the quake, cracks were found in the embankments of six rivers in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state, and officials said floods could pose the next threat to the 10 million people. `` It may be the second coming. All the rivers are in full spate, and if the embankments breach, we are in for serious problems,'' said <PERSON> Puranman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittal </PERSON>, the relief commissioner in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state, which suffered the most damage in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> residents ran screaming through the streets on Wednesday when a mild tremor rumbled through the area. No casualties or damage was reported, witnesses and the <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> said. Residents in <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION>, the worst-hit area of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, also raced from their homes Wednesday during two aftershocks, officials in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> said. No further damage was reported in the city, where 100 houses collapsed during the quake. Rescue workers demolished 50 homes in <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION> on Wednesday that were severely damaged in the temblor, police inspector <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adhikari </PERSON> said. `` We will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied -LRB- the ones remaining -RRB- are to safe to live in,'' he said. `` This is the biggest calamity to strike <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Marich </PERSON> <PERSON> Man </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrestha </PERSON>, said Tuesday after a tour of devastated areas in his nation. At least 758 people died and 950 were injured in both countries Sunday when the earthquake jolted the mountainous India-Nepal border region. It was the deadliest quake to strike the subcontinent since 1950, when, by official count, 1,500 people were killed in the eastern Indian state of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>. Indian officials said Wednesday that at least 196 died in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in Sunday's disaster. Officials in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> said at least 562 people were killed in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, including 31 people whose bodies were found in remote areas on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state, officials said the water had reached dangerous levels and was still rising in six rivers: the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION>, the Ghagara, the Burigandak, the <LOCATION> Bagmati </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Koshi </PERSON> and the Mahananada. To make matters worse, survey teams found cracks in the embankments of the six rivers, which are swollen by monsoon rains that began in late June. Engineers tried to strengthen the weakened embankments with cement, and helicopters made aerial surveys watching for ruptures. As survivors in both countries began rebuilding homes damaged or destroyed by the quake, medicine, food and financial aid began arriving from abroad. <PERSON> Elroy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 25,000 in aid. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> presented the government with a similar amount for Indian victims. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, said three medical teams had been sent to <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION>. `` The teams are carrying two truckloads of blood and medicine,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. The British army also runs a military hospital in <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION>, where at least 100 people were admitted. The government hospital in <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION> treated hundreds of people injured when brick and wood houses collapsed. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> also sent medical teams to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, and the government began distributing 90-pound bags of rice. The relief efforts were hampered in both countries by heavy rains which cut off communications and road links to several of the affected areas. `` The earthquake hit a wide area, and it is a big job to reach the remote villages. But we are trying,'' said <PERSON> Mittal </PERSON>, the relief official in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state.

He also said <PERSON> Maleng </PERSON> thoroughly checked the case and noted a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> opinion stated the conviction would withstand appeal. <PERSON> Maleng </PERSON> also said that, if necessary, he could impose a murder charge at a later date since there is no statute of limitations. The charges against Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, stemmed from the June 1986 deaths of her husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, also of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>. Both died after taking cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules. Besides putting tainted pills in a bottle of capsules used by her husband, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> was accused of placing poison pills in capsule containers on store shelves to make her husband's death appear to be at the hands of a random killer. She stood to gain about $ 100,000 more in life insurance policies if her husband died by other than natural causes. The deaths touched off a nationwide tampering scare and caused Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myer to recall the brand.

 Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders agreed Wednesday to meet next month for unconditional talks aimed at reunifying their war-divided island. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> held a working lunch for <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> of the Turkish Cypriot side in which he said the two men pledged `` a determined and sustained effort'' to resolve issues that have long divided <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> said the meeting `` created a new opportunity for finding a just and lasting solution of the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> leader told reporters. `` It was a good beginning, we made progress on the procedural issues,'' said <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, recently elected president of the internationally recognized <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> government. It was <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>'s first meeting with <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, president of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in the Turkish-occupied part of the island, which is only recognized internationally by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> also seemed satisfied by the meeting, saying <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> was `` a good talker and negotiator.'' The <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem arose first in the wake of intercommunal clashes in 1963 that led to the dispatch of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peace force to the island. It was aggravated in July 1974 when <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded and occupied 37 percent of the island in the wake of a coup by supporters of union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>'s unilateral declaration of independence in November 1983 was declared legally invalid by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which demanded its abrogation. Previous negotiations between <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Spyros </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> broke down in December 1985. <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> had insisted the negotiations follow the implementation of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions demanding the withdrawal of the estimated 30,000 Turkish troops from north <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. `` I believe we will be able to find ways of settling the various problems. He is different from <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, however, indicated the question of troop withdrawal was likely to be the biggest stumbling block. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> on Wednesday reiterated his position that there can be no withdrawal `` before the dissolution of the illegal <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> government,'' and its replacement by a joint Greek-Turkish Cypriot administration. A senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official close to the negotiations said the meeting `` went better than we expected and the two leaders got along very well indeed.'' `` We are sure they have already laid the foundations of fruitful future negotiations,'' the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said negotiations between the two <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> sides will start Sept. 15 in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. The venue will be a hotel in the UN-patrolled no-man's - land splitting the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sectors of the city for He added that the two leaders will meet again Sept. 16 and `` recognized that the success of these talks depended on their personal and continuous involvement.'' The two also agreed to meet with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` after the first rounds of meetings in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> to review the progress achieved during this initial stage,'' he added. Greek and Turkish Cypriot sources revealed that the <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> talks would be carried out on an intensive daily basis and that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> meeting would be held at the end of October. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said the two leaders also had reaffirmed their committment to agreements reached between 1977 and 1984 for the settlement of the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem through the establishment of a bizonal federation. The other major outstanding issues involve the implementation of a series of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions ignored by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. These demand the repatriation of 50,000 mainland settlers from north <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and the return of 200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees, one-third of the island population, to their homes there. The two sides, however, disagree on constitutional aspects and the powers of the central government.

 The head of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> resigned Wednesday to take responsibility for a submarine collision that killed 30 people aboard a sports fishing boat last month. <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON>, fighting back tears, urged his successor to take steps to restore public confidence in the Self-Defense Forces after a series of accidents. `` Many innocent lives were lost in an extremely regrettable accident ... in which the defense force was one of the parties involved,'' <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON> told reporters after handing in his resignation to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON>, 51, who served as director-general for 10 months, said his successor, <PERSON> Kichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tazawa </PERSON>, should `` take over the responsibility of ensuring that such an accident never occurs again.'' <PERSON> Tazawa </PERSON>, installed as agency head Wednesday night, said in a televised news conference that pursuing a safer armed forces would be his major goal. The fishing boat, the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru, was rammed in the side by the massive Nadashio naval submarine on July 23. Japanese were outraged when television reports and witnesses' accounts revealed crew members standing on the submarine and watching people drown. `` While defense has grown ... increasingly important for our country, there have been a large number of incidents involving the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON> said. The submarine crash brings the number of military accidents this year to 11 and the death toll to 32. Critics say public confidence in the military is waning in a country where the armed forces have rarely been popular. <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON> becomes the first <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> director-general in 17 years to relinquish his post in a controversy involving to the armed forces. In 1971, <PERSON> Keikichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuhara </PERSON> resigned to take responsibility for the deaths of 162 people when a military plane collided with a commercial domestic airliner in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It is customary for high-ranking business executives or government officials to assume responsibility for a major incident and resign as a means of restoring public confidence in the institution they represent. Two other defense agency officials _ <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> deputy head <PERSON> Seiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishihiro </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> Shuichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Higashiyama </PERSON>, chief of staff of the Maritime Self-Defense Forces _ also indicated they would resign after the submarine collision, but <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON> reportedly refused to allow them to step down. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> attended a memorial service Wednesday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for the 30 victims of the submarine collision and reaffirmed that the government would take steps to prevent accidents and provide compensation for the victims' families.

<HEAD>Dispute Over Pollution Threatens 76-year-Old, Lakefront Gun Club</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gun enthusiasts who have been shooting clay targets along <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s lakefront for generations are under fire from the parks agency and citizens groups who say the 76-year-old club is polluting <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Patrons of the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> situated two miles from downtown argue that it is a unique part of the lakefront's heritage and one of few places in the city where people from all walks of life can compete on equal ground. But the Park District and others complain of lead shot, clay targets and plastic wads from shotgun shells. A Park District committee takes up the issue tonight, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaszak </PERSON>, an attorney for the agency. The skeet and trap shooting club was founded in 1912, when patrons showed up in straw hats and three-piece suits. Now, they wear everything from hunting clothes to shorts. Membership costs $ 220 per year, and members can shoot for $ 3 per round while non-members must pay $ 6. The club on city-owned land pays upkeep but no rent, said club manager <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>. It has 386 members but more than 5,000 people come to shoot every year. `` It's an integral part of the lakefront and an example of the diversity of this city,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonia </PERSON>, a 41-year-old health care executive who came to the gun club with his father more than 20 years ago. `` It does n't make any difference how much money you make _ if you do n't hit the target, it does n't break,'' added <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>, club vice president. Club officials acknowledge that the plastic wads cause litter but said the organization is willing to hire people to pick up them up. They also said the lead shot, wads and clay targets do not pollute the water. `` It's more a litter problem than a pollution problem,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. `` The gun club says it's litter, but we say it's water pollution,'' argued <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Denning </PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> field office of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s division of water pollution. <PERSON> Denning </PERSON> said that the clay and shot do not appear to threaten marine life but that state law requires <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> waters be free of debris. Opponents of the club also say it is a safety hazard. `` We have concerns about the operation and usage of guns in such a highly dense park facility,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kaszak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said the club's record speaks for itself. `` We've been here 76 years and we've never have an accident,'' he said. `` You're safer here than you are in a golf course.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday qualified its backing of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential candidacy, declaring a 15 percent abstention primarily because of opposition by wire service employees to any political endorsements. Three of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s 90 other affiliated unions _ the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> and the Marine Engineers _ voted to abstain their entire memberships in the labor federation's formal endorsement of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> The Marine Engineers for three decades have opposed making a presidential endorsement and the Air Line Pilots said they had not had a meeting of their executive board on making an endorsement. Teamster President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, whose union endorsed <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984, said he was abstaining on a presidential endorsement until after a mail poll of his union's members is completed in mid-September. Newspaper Guild President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> said his union's executive board and convention in June `` gave its blessing'' to a presidential endorsement But primarily because of uproars in the past from its 1,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> local, he told the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s general board that he was casting only 21,390 votes for a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> endorsement and voting his union's 4,000 other members as abstaining `` At least one of our locals _ the <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, representing employees of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> _ has a policy of dissassociating itself from any political endorsements by this international,'' he said. `` So I note that our vote does not carry with it the support of members of that local.'' In 1983, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> had cast all of its members' votes in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s early endorsement of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. The following week the <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> formally dissociated itself from that endorsement, saying that because it represents reporters who cover political campaigns, it should refrain from taking sides in them. The local based its action on a membership referendum conducted in 1973 following the parent union's presidential campaign endorsement a year earlier of Democrat <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>.

 Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> suggested Wednesday that his Republican counterpart, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, lacks the maturity required of someone who might have to lead the country. `` I do n't think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can risk youthful indiscretion in someone who could become our president at any moment,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, told the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, in his toughest attack on the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator referred to a speech that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made earlier this week before the Veterans of Foreign Wars in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> blamed `` youthful indiscretion'' for his opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation that would establish a Cabinet-level Department of Veteran Affairs. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator told the VFW he was reversing that position. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said that was an example of how <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would behave if he were in the White House. `` A youthful indiscretion? My friends, that vote occurred only five weeks ago,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can risk youthful indiscretion in someone who could become our president at any moment.'' At a news conference after his speech, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> made a veiled reference to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s decision to seek entry into the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 during the Vietnam War. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, whose son joined the Guard one year earlier, has refused to attack <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> directly on that issue. Asked about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a former World War II bomber pilot, said: `` I certainly do n't think he's too young. But I think that you have to have some maturity. `` And I think that the breadth of experience that I've had, and the tests that I've undergone, some of the things that happened to me early on, in combat, make you grow up pretty fast.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s quick switch on the VA bill showed that he did n't have `` the continuity of judgment that you would expect,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who supported the veterans bill which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved July 12. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he was `` not stepping up criticisms of his -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s -RRB- personal life,'' and he made no mention of allegations involving <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s association with former lobbyist <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> during a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> golfing weekend in 1980. But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he was `` just getting started'' comparing his record and experience with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s. Asked if he thought <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would still be on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket in November, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> replied: `` I hope so.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> received a warm reception from the Southern legislators, many of them pro-Reagan Democrats, not long after <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> addressed them. The two candidates met briefly at the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> airport, where <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he had just `` warmed up the crowd'' for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The two shook hands and laughed. In his speech, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> criticized <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assertion that he would create 30 million new jobs in eight years. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said there were only 6.5 million people looking for work. `` The only way you'd get 30 million jobs is to take away the border patrol and move one-third of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> here,'' he said. `` Or raise the working age to 80.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement was another example of `` voodoo economics,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` There is no real alternative to the honest, able leadership of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is right for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> _ take it from a Texan.'' From <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and visited a senior citizens home. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman talked about his efforts toward enacting a catastrophic health insurance law. He told about 300 residents of Dosker Manor that despite their talk of helping the elderly, the Republicans had tried to cut back programs for seniors. `` Do n't just read their lips, see what they do,'' he said, twisting a phrase that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used had used in his acceptance speech at the GOP National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> about opposing tax increases.

 The captain of the USS Dubuque is refusing to appear at a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> disciplinary hearing on charges of dereliction of duty for failing to rescue a boatload of Vietnamese refugees who claim they later resorted to cannibalism to survive, the service says. Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has been charged with two counts of violating lawful orders under a section of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that calls for `` non-judicial punishment proceedings,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He was ordered to appear at a closed `` admiral's mast'' this afternoon before Vice Adm. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the head of all surface ships in the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, the spokesman added. At such a hearing, <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> could be stripped permanently of his command, fined or issued a letter of reprimand or censure. But <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> notified the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday afternoon that he was exercising his right to refuse the admiral's mast, said Captain <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Litrenta </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. `` This wo n't be dropped,'' a source said. `` If he does n't show up for the mast tomorrow, then there's going to be a court martial.'' <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> was charged with violating a general <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> regulation `` by wrongfully failing to render appropriate assistance to Vietnamese refugees found on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on June 9, 1988, in danger of being lost.'' The second count accuses him of violating standing operational orders for the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> `` which require a commanding officer to aid and rescue refugees encountered at sea in life-endangering circumstances.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> also alleges <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> `` was derelict in the performance of those duties in that he negligently failed to investigate sufficiently and render appropriate assistance ... as it was his duty to do.'' In an admiral's mast, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> would serve as the lone judge or authority in considering the evidence. Given <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>'s decision not to attend, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> will have to decide whether to drop the matter or order an Article 32 hearing. An Article 32 hearing, similar to a civilian grand jury proceeding, is the first step in a full military court martial. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> could receive a maximum penalty of two years in prison and total forfeiture of pay if the case went to court-martial and he was convicted. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> was relieved temporarily of his command of the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> on Aug. 13 pending the outcome of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation. The <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, an amphibious landing ship, encountered the boatload of Vietnamese refugees while steaming to duty in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> gave the refugees several hundred pounds of food and water and navigational aids but did not take them aboard because `` the refugee craft was judged seaworthy'' by <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> regulations and orders specify that warships should `` be alert for refugees on the high seas'' and `` if encountered, ships are to extend humanitarian assistance as needed.'' `` In the case of an unseaworthy vessel, adverse weather or other special circumstances, the refugees may be embarked and transported to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship's next port of call.'' The boat people eventually were rescued off the coast of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and taken to a refugee camp there, where reports of murder and cannibalism began to surface. Some survivors have been quoted as saying they ate fellow passengers to stay alive after they encountered the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>. Two victims reportedly died of starvation, but three others allegedly were murdered through drowning and then eaten. Some survivors charged the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> refused to take them aboard even though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure and starvation. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION> has been investigating those reports. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commission's <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> representative, said 52 refugees survived 37 days at sea but 58 people died during the crossing. The refugees began their journey May 22 from the <ORGANIZATION> Mekong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> town of <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Tre </PERSON> aboard a 35-foot wooden boat. Its engine failed two or three days later.

 The man whose book `` The Graduate'' became the smash-hit movie of an idealistic generation says he is nearly destitute, living out of a van and trying to make ends meet on a few thousand dollars a year. `` It's hard to make anybody believe the author of ` The Graduate' needs money,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, 49, who says his abhorrence of materialism led him to give away two houses in his salad days Hard times, however, have driven <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> and his ex-wife, an artist who calls herself <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>, out of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campground where they lived for the last decade to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town where <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> went to college 30 years ago. He came East, he said Wednesday, in hopes of finding a publisher for his latest project, a compilation of writings on prejudice. His plight, however, has taken him to a welfare office in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION>, which rejected him because he has no permanent address. `` The things he stands for and believes in are principles he ca n't live by any longer,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>, 48, who still lives with her ex-husband. The novelist, whose hero in `` The Graduate,'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Braddock </PERSON>, struck a chord among young readers with his post-graduate misery at his parents' suburban home, has lived until now according to what friends consider impossibly high and even self-destructive standards. `` If he's hard up for dough, it's obviously due to ... his inclination toward divestiture,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a college classmate who teaches at the private <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said he gave a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> house to a real estate agent in the 1960s and another home to the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in 1970, because he felt the need for `` getting free of things.'' Getting free also explains his and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>'s decision eight years ago to get a divorce although they had no intention of separating. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> said the couple felt marriage violated their constitutional freedoms. The couple were married in 1962, the year `` The Graduate'' was published and a year after his graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, son of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> doctor, epoused odd views even back in college, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` We always used to wonder whether <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> was putting us on,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` He's quite sophisticated, a very intelligent person with a real heart, but he always said things that sounded peculiarly simple.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> says he received only $ 20,000 for the film rights to `` The Graduate,'' which made a star of <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> when it came out in 1967. The novel, however, is still in print and continues to earn him a few thousand dollars in royalties annually. `` The Graduate'' was followed by four other novels, including `` The Marriage of A Young Stockbroker,'' which also was made into a movie. His last work, `` Booze,'' was published in 1978. That year, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> took his two sons, then in the sixth and ninth grades, out of school and went `` underground'' because of his fear that schools were harming their minds. After a year in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Webbs </ORGANIZATION> moved to <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where they remained, living in their van, until they returned to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> a few months ago. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said he stopped writing during that time, reluctantly accepting support from his mother, to raise his sons and concentrate on larger issues, such as prejudice. `` I came to feel that writing fiction was a more narrow concern than addressing problems that went beyond my narrow, career-oriented goals,'' he said. Both sons are now in graduate school, one studying <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> and the other art. `` I hope that's an indication they are going to be a little more stable than their parents,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. But he added that he does n't regret the unusual life that led to his present situation. `` It's hard to think there would be another way to do it.''

 Security forces armed with machine guns prevented sectarian violence Wednesday as thousands of Shiites marched through <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> cities and beat themselves to observe a major Moslem holy day. The marches came one week after the death of President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem whose policies drew criticism from hard-line Shiites. The cause of the plane crash that killed <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> is not known, but sabotage is suspected. Sectarian friction between Shiite Moslems, a small minority, and the majority Sunni Moslems typically increases on Ashura, which marks the death almost 1,400 years ago of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s grandson, <PERSON> Imam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> About 30 people have died this year in Sunni-Shiite gun battles in northern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, according to news reports. Tension rose in early August after the assassination by unidentified gunmen of Pakistani Shiite leader <PERSON> Arif </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Hussaini </PERSON> in the northwest frontier city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. New clashes were reported in the region after <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> died Aug. 17 in a plane crash that also killed <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and 28 others. The Shiite procession in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> and other major cities went off without incident and disbanded before dusk Wednesday. During the processions fervent Shiites beat their chests and flogged their backs with switches of razor-sharp metal to show devotion to the martyr. In the southern port of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, the country's largest city, up to 40,000 Shiites marched through the main district in observance of the Ashura holiday, but no violent incidents were reported. About 20,000 police, paramilitary units and army regulars dressed in full battle gear lined <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>'s streets along the procession. They drove vehicles mounted with machine guns and kept watch from rooftops on the seven-mile route. In <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, another procession of 40,000 people peacefully made its way along tightly guarded city streets. Authorities imposed curfew-like conditions along the route, with residents ordered to stay indoors and not look out their windows, a witness said. Acting President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> and other government leaders had made pleas for sectarian harmony on the eve of Ashura. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> officials say they believe <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death was a result of sabotage but have not said who they think is responsible. Some officials have hinted at agents of neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s pro-Soviet government An investigation by American and <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> officials is being conducted. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, a Sunni, instituted Moslem law in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, but hard-line Shiites claimed the program did not take into account their form of jurisprudence. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s Shiites also disapproved of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s close ties to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has has long had icy relations with Shiite-led <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A flurry of political activity has followed <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death as political leaders prepare for crucial nationwide elections scheduled for November. Opposition leader <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> on Tuesday called on <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> to dismiss the Cabinet and appoint a caretaker government until elections. Thirteen of the 16 Cabinet ministers were appointed by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> leads the country's largest opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and has expressed confidence that if elections were conducted fairly, her group would win. She has demanded the government rescind <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s order that all candidates run unaffiliated with a party. In 1977, a coup led by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ousted Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. Two years later, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> had the former official executed.

 When the parents of 12-year-old <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> buried their strangled daughter, their 10-year-old son was close to dying from stab wounds. The next evening, when the children's often-distraught father disappeared, the family feared <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> might harm himself and police issued an all-points bulletin. Then, several days later, the 41-year-old <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> was arrested at the apartment of a co-worker and charged with attempted murder in the Aug. 16 attack on his son. Prosecutors said laboratory results will determine whether the father may also be charged with the murder of <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, who was strangled and raped. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> appeared in court Wednesday and asked for a court-appointed lawyer. No bail was set. The day after <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>'s burial and again Tuesday, police talked to her younger brother, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>, about the attacks that occurred after Mrs. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> left the family's home. She found the children when she returned home. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, who lost four pints of blood and was found face-down in a bathtub, was n't told of his sister's death until a week after the attacks. The boy had been stabbed repeatedly in the back, apparently with scissors. Cobb County District Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Charron </PERSON> said the warrants for <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> were based on interviews with the boy and other evidence, but he would not reveal what the boy told investigators. `` There is a lot of evidence and no inconsistencies,'' he said at a news conference Tuesday night. Family members described <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> as prone to leaving home. `` He was a good father. He just had this problem of skipping whenever the pressures got tough,'' said <PERSON> Lill </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>'s mother-in-law `` There's a lot of unanswered questions, ... an awful lot,'' said father-in-law B.L. <PERSON> Anderton </PERSON>. `` And I do n't know if I want to know the answers.'' <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON> <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON>, said it was common for her son to vanish for six or seven months at a time. Family members said <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> left his wife shortly after <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> was born and did n't return for years. Although the couple had been divorced, they had lived together since 1986, the family members said. Mrs. <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON> said <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> dropped out of high school to join the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, was rebuffed because of his age but joined a year later and eventually returned to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to marry a woman 10 years his senior. She died of pneumonia. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> served time in jail on abandonment charges after his first wife swore out a warrant against him, his mother said.

<HEAD>Strike at Key Mine in Hungary</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 300 workers went on strike at a key mine in southern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on Wednesday, demanding restoration of cuts in bonuses and changes in a new income tax, state radio said. The strike at the <ORGANIZATION> Mecsek </ORGANIZATION> mine near Pecs marked the first known worker protest against the stringent economic policies of <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> since he became Communist Party leader in May. State radio said agreement was reached to restore the cut bonuses and that some strikers resumed work. Other strikers, said to include more than 300 miners and an unspecified number of office workers, would wait until Thursday, it was reported. The radio reported the strikers threatened to stop work again if parliament does not vote to iron out a quirk in a new tax law that gives some workers on sick benefit more net income than those working normally. The strike coincided with labor unrest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but appeared unconnected. Reports of strikes have been extremely rare in communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, although there were scattered reports of labor unrest in 1969, 1977 and 1980-81. Wednesday's relatively swift reporting of the miners' stoppage appeared to reflect the greater openness of state-run media under <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the stoppage began Tuesday night, when 150 miners refused to start the evening shift at the <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> pithead in the <ORGANIZATION> Mecsek </ORGANIZATION> colliery at <LOCATION> Komlo </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of Pecs near the Yugoslav border. The day shift of 150 miners also refused to go into the pit head and the stoppage spread to `` several other sections,'' state radio said. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> called the stoppage `` a pure industrial dispute with no political undertones.'' <PERSON> Komlo </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s only mine producing high-grade black coking coal for the Danubian iron works, one of the nation's three main iron and steel mills. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said one grievance of the striking miners was computation of personal income tax introduced Jan. 1 as part of <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s efforts to curb <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s $ 18 billion gross foreign debt and to stimulate the economy. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s official trade unions have criticized the policies, saying workers, pensioners and the unemployed must be protected against inflation, already running at 18 percent this year. Miners are among the most militant workers in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The official trade union organization <ORGANIZATION> SZOT </ORGANIZATION> protested Wednesday against a provision in the new tax system that means workers on sick leave can end up with more net income than those who work regularly. Government spokesman <PERSON> Gyorgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marosan </PERSON> said without elaborating that this was an anomaly the government soon would fix. The miners' other main complaint was that the new tax system has sliced annual bonuses by 30 percent to 50 percent, radio said. <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Zipper </PERSON>, deputy industry minister, told <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> it would be up to parliament to decide whether to change the tax law, but that companies should make up bonuses to last year's levels. Banks should give credits for this to companies posting a deficit, <PERSON> Zipper </PERSON> said. This appeared to weaken recent government statements that enterprises would have to turn a profit or face closure as a result of reduced state subsidies.

<TEXT>
 A new effort to improve the capital's beleaguered public schools will give principals broader power and eliminate some of their bosses, officials announced Wednesday `` We've been a top-down organization, and we want to put more authority and responsibility where the action is,'' school superintendent <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` We are going to make the local school principal more responsible.'' Special and bilingual education programs also will receive more attention, the superintendent said. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> was appointed head of the city's schools in May under a contract that required him to overhaul the school system. He pledged Wednesday that the new plan would be put into effect by February, 1989. Various national surveys have ranked the capital's public schools near the bottom of the list for urban areas. One study, by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, gave the district's 88,000-student school system a grade of 17 out of a possible 100 after comparing attendance rates, average SAT scores, teacher-student ratios, dropout rates and the number of college-level courses offered in 52 metropolitan school systems. Only <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools near <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, rated lower than the capital's school system. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> had no cost projections for the new program, but promised the school system would stay within its $ 623 million budget for fiscal year 1989, which begins Oct. 1. One major change is that the position of `` regions'' _ adminstrators responsible for overseeing several schools at once _ will be eliminated. Instead, the principals of each school will report directly to <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> or a yet-to-be-appointed vice superintendent. `` After awhile, all bureaucracies become out of sync,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` They need to be put back together.'' Although he provided no specific figures, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said other less visible administrative positions would be eliminated. Those employees will be reassigned within the system instead of being dismissed, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` At the end of the school year, I expect to see tangible progress'' in standardized achievement scores,'' the superintendent said.

The court acquitted another 434 people. All of the defendants were charged with belonging to the violent and outlawed Marxist group <LOCATION> Dev-Yol </LOCATION> -LRB- Revolutionary Path -RRB-.

 The persistent controversy surrounding <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is worrying some <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> state legislators who said Wednesday they fear it is diverting attention from <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s message to the voters. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, received a warm welcome from the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> for a brief speech that followed an address by his Democratic counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Afterward, several <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> legislators said in interviews that the attention focused on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s service in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War and other issues is hurting the national Republican ticket. `` I think anytime you spend a lot of time about an ancillary issue ... obviously it's divisive,'' said <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hainkel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` It has n't been good because it's taken the spotlight off the things we ought to be talking about,'' <PERSON> Hainkel </PERSON> said. State Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> of Hazard, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, agreed. `` It's kind of stymied the ticket,'' Strong said. `` It's dominated the news where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't get his message across State Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tysinger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, said that both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Democratic ticket led by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have suffered from all the attention paid to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` It has hurt both of them,'' <PERSON> Tysinger </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has n't been in the news, and neither has <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> legislators saw some benefits flowing from the Quayle controversy. `` It has added to the party, and I want to thank the press,'' said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Martinsville </LOCATION>. `` It's inviting more questions, and I think the exposure's good. `` I think it's brought more focus to the ticket,'' said state Del. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lutherville </LOCATION>, Md. `` You do n't hear anything about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> anymore.'' No Republican interviewed Wednesday said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s problems are serious enough to warrant his removal from the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. `` If I was <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I would n't even consider that,'' <PERSON> Hainkel </PERSON> said. `` You'd infuriate every man who ever served in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, for one thing.'' Many lawmakers thought the news media would suffer a backlash if they kept alive questions about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s National Guard service. Most said enough had been written and uttered about the subject. `` It's detracted from what the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people need to know,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tenn </PERSON>.

It would be like if I was going to hire you to be an over-the-road trucker and the only thing that I tested you for was the ability to eat french fries.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said his investigators looked at firefighters' examinations in several major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities The result was a report issued Tuesday in which an unidentified fire chief in another city was quoted as saying, `` If you were going to design a test to exclude women, you'd end up with the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> test.'' The report concluded there was probable cause that discrimination against women took place, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. A complaint was filed after all 17 women who took the test in May failed to pass. They had all passed a separate written exam. A judge temporarily halted the hiring of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> firefighters pending the investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the next step is to try to resolve the dispute through an informal conciliation process with city officials. If that is unsuccessful, he said, litigation is a last resort. Assistant City Attorney <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said neither he nor other city officials would comment immediately. `` We'll respond in the next several days as to what approach we're going to take,'' he said. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s report said the test was unfair to female applicants and is discriminatory even in the absence of an intent to discriminate. The city failed to meet its burden of showing that its methodology is valid and that the extreme effect it has on women is justified, he said. `` There is no evidence that a person's score on the physical test is predictive of his-her future job performance as a firefighter,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the timed test measured only sprinting ability and upper body strength, areas in which men excel while ignoring stamina, an area in which women can perform well. A ladder climb and blindfold maze race, events in which women can often outrun men, were not rated for speed but scored on a pass-fail basis.

<HEAD>Parliamentary Deadlock Could Cause New Fighting In Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A bitter feud among lawmakers over <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s role in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has prevented the election of a new Lebanese president and could rekindle the nation's 13-year war between Moslems and Christians. Parliamentary deputies representing the 80 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> controlled by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the nation's main power broker, and its Moslem militia allies want a president willing to crush <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main foe, the right-wing Lebanese Forces. The Lebanese Forces _ the Christians' main militia which has links to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ is blocking re-election of former president <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> branded by political rivals as `` <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s candidate.'' `` Should a constitutional vacuum develop, one can kiss <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> goodbye,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> politician <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sleiman </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s fate is at stake,'' said parliamentary deputy <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaff </PERSON>, also a Christian. <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, 78, governed from 1970 to 1976. He is the front-runner in a lackluster field of candidates that includes <PERSON> Dany </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamoun </PERSON>, son of the late <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamoun </PERSON>, another former president. Behind the friction lie old hatreds. <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> holds the Lebanese Forces leader, <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, responsible for killing his son <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>'s wife and 3-year-old daughter along with 30 others in a raid on the family's summer mansion in June 1978. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> opposes <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s strategy of seeking political reforms that would give Moslems equal power with the Christians, who have dominated the government, judiciary and army since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. Back then, the Christians were considered the majority. Now, Moslems comprise about 55 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 4 million people and Christians make up 45 percent. In July, just 38 of the 76 members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> attended a session to elect a new president, far short of the quorum needed. All but two of the deputies who turned up were Moslems. They accused the Lebanese Forces of physically preventing Christian deputies from attending. No date for a new session has been set. There have been no parliamentary elections in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1972. The 99-seat house has simply renewed its mandate every two years. The Lebanese Forces pledged: `` There will be no quorum so long as <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> is a candidate.'' But the Syrians declared they still back <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s staunch support for <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> against local, regional and international powers is a very risky move that could plunge <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into all-out violence,'' said a foreign diplomat who demanded anonymity. A Moslem politician, who asked not to be identified, said: `` If the spirit of challenge persists, we might not have a president by Sept. 23.'' That's when the six-year term of the incumbent president, <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, expires. Under constitutional rules, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, 46, can not run again for a consecutive second term. The politician noted: `` Franjieh, whether candidate or president, means war. If elected, he'll launch war on the Lebanese Forces, and if not elected, he'll launch war on them.'' After more than a decade of war and the fragmentation of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into a cluster of sectarian cantons, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s authority is limited to his own stronghold in the <LOCATION> Metn </LOCATION> mountains. The Lebanese Forces control the rest of the shrunken Christian enclave. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its Moslem allies have boycotted <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> for 2 -LCB- years, since he torpedoed a Syrian-brokered peace accord under which the Christians would surrender some of their power. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s acting prime minister, <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni, went to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Wednesday for talks with Syrian leaders on the presidential deadlock, a senior government official said in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` He will certainly discuss with the Syrian command what should be done if a president is not elected by Sept. 23,'' the offcial added, speaking on condition of anonymity. Despite their differences, most Lebanese factions believe a constitutional vacuum will be disastrous. Under an unwritten national covenant, dating back to independence, the president has to be a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker a Shiite Moslem. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s independent An-Nahar daily said <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> would form an interim government headed by a Maronite prime minister if a president is not elected before Sept. 23. The 1943 covenant allows a Maronite to be named prime minister if the presidential post is vacant. But 10 Syrian-backed leftist and Moslem factions warned they will prevent such a government from running the country. Besides <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, a warlord whose private army controls north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, none of the other half-dozen <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> contenders appears to have much of a chance.

 Blacks and other racial minorities constitute 16 percent of the workforce of American newspapers, but only 8 percent of the news and editorial staffs, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION> survey, made public Wednesday, also said that 37 percent of the papers' employees are women. In the nation's overall workforce, minorities constitute 21 percent and women 47 percent of the total. The study suggested that the newsroom was the place in a newspaper plant were minorities were least likely to be found. Ten percent of newsroom employees were members of minorities, and, when clerical and administrative workers were subtracted, the number dropped to 8 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorfano </PERSON>. That finding approximates the results of an annual survey conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>. In April, the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> survey found blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> constituted 7.02 percent of newsroom employees, a slight increase from the 6.56 percent level in 1987 but a sharp increase from the 3.95 percent in the survey's first year, 1978 The <ORGANIZATION> ASNE </ORGANIZATION> survey was based on responses from 1,092 of the approximately 1,645 daily newspapers published in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION> study, responses came from 546 of the 1,443 daily newspapers that were sent questionnaires. The study, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Belden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, was undertaken to give the association `` a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of our programs to assist individual newspapers in their efforts to increase employment and promotion opportunities for their employees,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochs </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulzberger </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION> and publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. It was the first industrywide attempt to determine the racial composition of all departments in newspapers. The survey said that minorities constitute 22 percent of the employees in newspapers' general management _ including executive, professional, technical, clerical and service workers. They were 19 percent of the production workers and 19 percent of circulation workers; 17 percent of those in accounting, finance and information services; 13 percent of those in advertising and 11 percent in marketing, promotion and research. The <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION> said its <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and Constitution, is considering establishing a computerized national employment program to allow newspapers to list minoritiy job opportunities.

<HEAD>Armenians Renew Annexation Campaign for Disputed Region</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> residents rallied around their legislative building Wednesday while the deputies inside discussed grievances in the disputed region. The actions ended a month of relative quiet in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, an enclave of mostly Christian Armenians located within the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, near the border with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. From February to July, the residents went on strikes and street protests to demand that jurisdiction of their region be moved from predominantly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The campaign subsided in late July after the central leadership rejected the demand. Wednesday's report of many thousands of people gathered outside the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> legislative building in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> came from the state-run radio station in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital. The broadcast was monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported `` an all-city meeting'' at which the opinions of work collectives were expressed. The legislature appealed to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to consider the opinions of these work collectives and `` the wishes expressed by deputies'' about the administrative subordination of the region, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. This appeared to be a veiled reference to earlier demands for <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to be placed under the control of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. A resident of <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> said by telephone that people massed Wednesday to renew the annexation demand. But the telephone interview was cut off before the resident, a woman, could identify herself. Other calls to <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, did not go through. The <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> legislature also approved a new plan to improve the social and economic conditions in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> by 1995, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. So far, the program was being implemented `` unsatisfactorily,'' the legislature declared. The lawmakers also approved plans for strengthening the region's economic ties with business enterprises in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, and called for closer cooperation with the republic in `` spiritual and cultural life,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> was made part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923 although more than three-quarters of its residents are ethnic Armenians. They claim economic, cultural and religious discrimination under Azerbaijani rule. The Presidium of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on July 18 said <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> should remain part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, but it set up a commission to consider changes in its territorial status. The area is now classified as an autonomous region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The Presidium sent a representative, <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to help local authorities improve living conditions. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said without elaborating that he attended Wednesday's session of the Soviet of People's Deputies.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday that it took less time for an unemployed truck driver to be sworn into the Guard than it did <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who has been accused of using family influence to secure a spot with the Guard and avoid the Vietnam War. It took retired Sgt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> three days to complete processing and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator who is the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, 11 days, Guard records show. <PERSON> Morell </PERSON>, who says he dropped out of college and walked into a recruitment office, was offered a clerk-typist's position three days after undergoing preliminary testing on May 19, 1969. <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> served side-by-side with the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who records show was placed 11 days after he was tested May 8, 1969. `` We entered the Guard the same rank and left the Guard the same rank. And I was a nobody,'' <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Capt. <PERSON> Cathi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiger </PERSON> said how quickly recruits pass through preliminary processing, such as aptitude tests, interviews and physical examinations, often depends on the schedule of the person undergoing the tests. `` Enlisting can take anywhere from a week to a year,'' she said. `` We try to accomodate their schedules.'' <PERSON> Kiger </PERSON> said 348 non-prior-service recruits and 92 prior-service recruits wre enlisted during fiscal year 1969. The Guard lost 902 enlisted men during that year, she said. Reports that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> entered the Guard with the help of his family's influence have dogged his campaign. `` If his family really had all this influence like everyone says, he would have been sent directly to officer's candidate school and come out a lieutenant or captain,'' <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, whose maternal grandfather, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>, published several newspapers in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> was an OK guy,'' <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> said. `` He did his job, and I did mine. We washed dishes and washed jeeps together.'' <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> said he would not have found it particularly objectionable had <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> received preferential treatment. `` If someone would have offered me a hand, I would have shaken it and said thank you,'' he said. `` I do n't want to insinuate he got a hand, but if he was offered help, any fool would say thank you. And <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> is n't any fool.'' <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> said he was forced to drop out of college at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for financial reasons and, began considering the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you were n't a full-time student, you were full-time draft. There was no in-between,'' he said. `` I figured I might as well stay at home, do my weekend a month and get married,'' <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kiger </PERSON> said the service was below its authorized strength when the then-22-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> signed up. `` I can find no evidence that he was given special consideration and there was no need,'' <PERSON> Kiger </PERSON> said. `` Units that were not up to 100 percent strength could continue to recruit.'' But Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> said Tuesday that he received a call at that time regarding <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> from <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON>, managing editor of The <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON> newspaper. <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> was a retired Guard major general. <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> said he contacted the Guard's personnel office on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s behalf `` They said they had a couple of spaces,'' <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` I said hold one of them, there's a good guy coming over.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, South African, Cuban and Angolan officials met Wednesday to negotiate a timetable for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. No statement was issued after the four parties met for three hours, but reporters were told they would meet again Thursday. A Soviet and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' representative were present in the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> capital, but did not attend the talks. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, met separately with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the Cuban and Angolan delegations before the four-party talks began. In <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said the possibility of peace in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has never been nearer since rebels took up arms against the Portuguese colonial army for independence of the southern African nation in 1961. `` Never as now, since the historic morning of Feb. 4, 1961, has peace for our heroic and suffering people been so visible on the horizon,'' <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the country's representative body, in an Angolan news agency report. Cuban troops have supported <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in fighting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South Africa-backed <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels in a guerrilla war against the Marxist-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> government. The war has continued since <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> gained its independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s guerrillas of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, which stands for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, have not been involved in the talks. The Angolan government refuses to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, calling them bandits and stooges of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> also has refused to adhere to the cease-fire agreement, which was signed Monday on the Angolan-South-West African frontier by military representatives from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s forces have received support the last year from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration has pressed <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, saying that no complete peace could be reached without such a reconciliation. <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said disagreement exists over the timetable for withdrawal of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops _ `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> wants them to be out in 12 months, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants 36 months, and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have proposed 48 months.'' But, <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> continued, `` all indications are that an agreement on a timetable will be possible.'' In <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, news reports have raised the possibility that <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> troops could participate in an international peace-keeping force in the region. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was quoted by the French newspaper <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> as saying he would accept <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s invitation to visit that country if the <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> talks go well <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said it will withdraw its troops from southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where they have supported anti-Marxist rebels as well as pursued black nationalists seeking to drive them from <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, by Sept. 1. This was to be the first phase leading to elections and independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> insisted on a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal within a year, saying their continued presence in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> would pose a threat after <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is granted independence. In <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said Wednesday that the new leadership of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has prompted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to throw its support behind the peace initiative in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` The <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> factor is important,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` This does not mean that the Russians have relinquished their plans for world domination and have become the world's friendly neighbor,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. `` What it does mean is that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has realized that the Russian economy can not support the extremely expensive involvement in remote regions of the world.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has provided the weaponry for <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government.

 Black people do not encounter racism in their day-to-day lives as brutally as they did 40 years ago, but they are always reminded of their racial identity by a society that emphasizes race in politics and big business, a panel of black sociologists said Wednesday. And while they are aware of efforts to stave off racial attacks, minorities still believe they are viewed with disdain by a society that designs its institutions to oppress non-whites, said the panel, which convened in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> during the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sociologists </ORGANIZATION>. `` Institutional ways of handling overt discrimination have improved, but there has been no significant change in dealing with white attitudes toward people of color,'' said panelist <PERSON> Myrna </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, an administrator at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>. `` We see considerable attention given to overt actions which could be labeled plain ol' blatant, redneck racism, and it's on the rise,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the incidence of racially motivated violence grew in proportion to the amount of publicity given the subject. She said <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published 144 articles on racial attacks in 1987, compared to 16 the previous year. The prevailing attitude among whites in American society is that `` anything done for people of color is at their -LRB- whites' -RRB- expense,'' and little has been done to dispel that sentiment, Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a sociologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, said the nation is fighting a new breed of institutional racism created by an administration that gave too much power to the private sector. `` This society has expounded on an ... economic sector of governance by private corporations larger than most states, when you speak of economic units controlling jobs and labor,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. He charged that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is `` putting the private governance in control of the decisions that used to be wielded by public government.'' Large corporations then used testing, screening and access to training to control the flow of minorities into the private sector, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` All of these devices, used by bureaucracies, can be used in the service of white supremacy,'' he said. `` How did that happen if we have an equal distribution of intelligence, skill and knowledge? `` It can only happen because private bureaucracies are able to use their bureaucratic mechanisms ... to deny the payment of a living wage to millions of full-time manual and service workers because they are black and powerless.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> also charged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> uses `` Machiavellian'' principles, such as at-large voting districts, gerrymandering and willful discrimination in housing practices, to work `` in the service of white advantage and white affirmative discrimination.''

<HEAD>Students Fighting To Distribute Abortion Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Students at <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s largest university said Wednesday they would fight an attempt by an anti-abortion group to keep them from distributing information on legal abortions. Earlier this month, the High Court served non-criminal summonses on four student leaders and an officer at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, who had refused to agree not to publish the names and telephone numbers of legal abortion clinics in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, whose population is 95 percent <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, has made abortion illegal under a 1983 constitutional amendment after a campaign led by the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child. The four students said Wednesday they would fight the society's allegations that they were breaking a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that said it was illegal under the 1983 amendment for pregnancy counseling centers to provide women with information on how to get a legal abortion The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has power over the High Court. The four students, elected to represent <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s 10,000 students, said they will distribute the abortion information in a manual to be published in October The anti-abortion group has demanded that the university administration not provide funds or facilities to aid the students in publishing the manual. The administration has not responded publicly. `` Our mandate is to provide information on all pregnancy options,'' said Student Union President <PERSON> Diarmuid </PERSON> <PERSON> Coogan </PERSON>. `` If they are to succeed in this case, it will have grave implications for civil liberties in Irish society.'' <PERSON> Coogan </PERSON> said other colleges, including <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, alsp have stated their intention to provide the names and addresses of the same clinics. But the anti-abortion society has not taken any action against the other schools. <PERSON> Coogan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> was being singled out by the anti-abortion group in a `` witch hunt'' and accused the group of using the school `` as a pawn in their game.'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> welfare officer <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Keary </PERSON>, who also received a summons, said 24 women had sought information on pregnancy and abortion from her since July 1. Within three weeks, the anti-abortion society must submit a detailed argument on their case against the students to the High Court. The students then have another three weeks to present their defense. During the six weeks, the anti-abortionists may seek a temporary injuction from the High Court against publication of the manual. If the High Court rules in favor of the anti-abortion group, the students will be banned from distributing the abortion information. Last month, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the group, said in an interview: `` The right to life is written into the constitution, and it overrides the right to information.''

 Would-be presidential assassin <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> `` Squeaky'' <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> and many other prisoners have been transferred in a major shuffling of female inmates in the federal prison system, officials said Wednesday. Prisons in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> were most affected by the transfers, which began this month, corrections officials said. A growing female prison population _ partially caused by an increase in the number of women convicted of drug crimes _ is forcing the government to shift inmates and open more facilities, prison officials said. <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> and four other women were moved from the high-security unit of the federal prison in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, on Friday when the unit was shut down. The <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> facility is being converted into an all-female medium - and minimum-security prison <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON>, a follower of cult leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, and two others were transferred to a new high-security unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Marianna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. One was sent to a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison, and federal officials refused to identify the fifth inmate or where she was sent. The all-female medium - and high-security facility inside the <PERSON> Marianna </PERSON> prison, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Shawnee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, had received 23 other women as of Wednesday _ 15 from the <ORGANIZATION> Alderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, seven from the <ORGANIZATION> Pleasanton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and one direct commitment, officials said It eventually will house about 55 inmates and will remain separate from a all-female low-security camp and a medium-level men's prison that is under construction, authorities said. `` It looks like a combination of an old Roman coliseum and a garish modern office building,'' <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> said Wednesday in a telephone interview from <PERSON> Marianna </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s panhandle. `` There's so much concertina wire it looks like they went into the hardware business.'' <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> said the first floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Shawnee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> was flooded Tuesday by rain. A prison spokeswoman said she was n't aware of flooding but acknowleged some minor problems with the new facility. `` It's like when you buy a new house, you work the bugs out,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Jama </PERSON> <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON>. Many of the women believed they were being transferred to a nicer facility and some volunteered to go to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON>, who is serving a life term for attempting to kill then-President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> in 1975. <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON>, where <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> spent 10 years before being moved to <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> after she escaped from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> prison last year, is being turned into a less secure `` camp'' facility, said Warden <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkhart </PERSON>. `` We're currently reviewing all of our inmates to see who can reasonably remain in a camp-type setting,'' <PERSON> Burkhart </PERSON> said. In addition to <PERSON> Marianna </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> high-risk inmates could be sent to federal prisons in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Pleasanton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, he said. About 35 percent of the inmates at <LOCATION> Alderson </LOCATION> are serving time for drug trafficking offenses, <PERSON> Burkhart </PERSON> said. A female satellite camp at an all-male prison also is under construction in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, officials said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> touted Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today as a man of action for whom the backup role of vice president `` did n't come easily.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a man of action _ a man accustomed to command,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said at a Reagan-Bush rally at the hotel where the president is staying during a break from his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranch vacation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> renewed his criticism of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' veto of a Pledge of Allegiance bill, saying that if confronted with such a measure he would have left it up to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether it was constitutional. `` What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so much?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in 1977 vetoed a bill that would have penalized any school teacher who failed to lead the pledge every morning. `` I would have signed the bill,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Any constitutional question that some might raise should be decided by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Before the rally, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met privately for 15 minutes with approximately 50 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> supporters and GOP leaders. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, in a joint statement, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the group, `` We will not give away one inch of ground in this state.'' They quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as urging them to `` saddle up and ride hard to exert every bit as much energy for <PERSON> George </PERSON> as you did for me.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the rally, saying `` The vice presidency does n't fit easily on such a man. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is also a patriot. And so he made it fit, and he served with a distinction no one has ever matched.'' `` I once said he is a great vice president, but I know and I've seen that it did n't come easily,'' the president said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made no reference to the controversy surrounding the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, but he said, `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stands for the same principles as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I do.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> heaped scorn on the Democrats in his speech, saying they had fielded `` a three-headed ticket that does n't know left from center'' _ a reference to presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, running mate Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and runnerup <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` They talk about reaching for the center, but on issues like national defense, they've taken positions that only a <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> could love,'' he said, reaching back to 1972 when liberal Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> was the Democratic presidential nominee. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed a landmark trade bill on a pier at <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and spoke at a rally in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> for Republican Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. As he left the platform in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, the president replied with a firm `` No'' when asked whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should drop his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, from the ticket. `` He's a fine man and well qualified for the job,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who is the center of controversy over his military and academic record. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, the second-ranking Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, was among officials on the platform as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation designed to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficits in world trade. The president's signature climaxed three years of skirmishing between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, but clearly did not mark an end to partisan debate over the trade issue. `` In 1981, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> committed to getting government out of your way,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told an audience of port officials, dock workers and others. Using an old nautical term, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> described the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy as yare, meaning `` easy to handle, quick to respond, bright, lively.'' `` This bill will allow us to provide up to a billion dollars a year for retraining workers to adjust to our turbo-charge economy _ an economy that, with the right leader, will remain yare,'' he said. In his fund-raising address for <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who is challenged by Democratic Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not going to trade away our winning team for third-stringers with a weak defense, a foreign policy of errors, curveball campaign promises, a set of policies to be named later, and billions of dollars in higher taxes.'' The speech is expected to be the first of many on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> ticket. The president has two political appearances _ for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Republicans in <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION> and for Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> _ scheduled Saturday on his way back to his ranch. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president also is expected to visit eight to 15 cities on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates after he returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sept. 6.

 <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s ruling party on Wednesday threatened to deal a `` death blow'' to instigators of tribal warfare that left 5,000 people dead and sent about 40,000 fleeing across the border. The refugees pouring into <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor, <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, claim the <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> army, which along with the government is dominated by the minority <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON> tribe, is taking part in a mass slaughter of the nation's majority <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> tribe. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said there was evidence refugees were wounded by troops. But a senior Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> said `` the idea the army is massacring Hutus, burning huts, etc., is just not what we're hearing here.'' `` Non-governmental sources, including missionaries coming down from the north, say the army is acting with a great deal of restraint,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition his name not be used. But he said the army `` still is engaged in fighting with dissident Hutus.'' The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement vowing `` to deal a death blow to outsiders who have been inciting peaceful Burundians to cause trouble in the country,'' according to state-run Radio <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>. The statement did not refer directly to refugees' claims of army involvement in a slaughter, but urged Burundians to desist from listening to `` foreign propaganda and false reports by foreign media.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Hutu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, an exiled opposition group, has charged that <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s military massacred thousands of Hutus. The government has denied the accusations and claims 5,000 people were killed in a slaughter instigated by exiled Hutus who infiltrated the tiny central African country to inflame anti-Tutsi sentiment. Despite making up nearly 85 percent of <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s 5 million people, the Hutu are subservient to the Tutsi, who comprise the remaining 15 percent and dominate the government and army. The Hutu and the Tutsi are longtime enemies. Following an abortive 1972 coup attempt in the former Belgian colony, the Tutsi massacred more than 100,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe's intelligentsia, according to human rights groups As of Tuesday, about 38,000 refugees had fled into <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> since the violence began Aug. 14, and an estimated 5,000 peasants continue to cross the border daily, said <PERSON> Code </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisse </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees representative in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>. `` We saw many people who had been injured by bullets and bayonets,'' <PERSON> Cisse </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` They said they were fleeing because they did n't want to get shot by the military.'' Most of those fleeing are members of the Hutu tribe, said <PERSON> Cisse </PERSON>, who visited border areas over the weekend. <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, a densely populated and impoverished nation, has appealed for international aid to cope with the influx of refugees which it says are straining its meager resources. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, meanwhile, has promised to work with those who fled to <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> and to make possible a speedy return home. Details about what sparked the current violence are sketchy. Refugees told <PERSON> Cisse </PERSON> the unrest began Aug. 5-6 with local opposition to an army attempt to arrest some Hutu, although the mass killing did not start until more than a week later. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, however, said they understood <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> initially turned on Tutsi. The region where most of the killing took place is in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s north, a remote hilly and marshy region, around the farming communies of <LOCATION> Ntega </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Marangara </PERSON> The army has since sealed off the region. The government has restricted travel between towns, enforced a dusk-to-dawn curfew nationwide and banned meetings of more than five people. The massacre was the first reported violence since Maj. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON> seized power in a bloodless coup Sept. 3, 1987, while former President <PERSON> Jean-Baptiste </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON> was attending a Francophone summit in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> covers an area about the size of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. About 6 million people live in slightly smaller <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>. There, the Hutu-Tutsi percentages are roughly equal, although the Hutu dominate the government.

 A federal appeals court judge once branded by opponents as unfit for the federal bench said Wednesday the smooth political career of his law school friend, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, left ill-prepared to handle controversy. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manion </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran and conservative Republican, dismissed questions about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s Vietnam-era service in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and a claim by former <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> propositioned her during a 1980 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacation. <PERSON> Manion </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> should remain on the Republican ticket as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. But he said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s political career might have gone better if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had chosen someone else. `` He walked into this thing unimpeded,'' <PERSON> Manion </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> scored upset victories over incumbent Democrats to win seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and easily won re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. `` From a guy who could walk down the street unrecognized, bang, he's suddenly put in the spotlight,'' <PERSON> Manion </PERSON> said. `` He was unprepared, and that's probably not a very good way to put a vice president in.'' <PERSON> Manion </PERSON> became a controversial figure when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nominated him in 1986 for an appeals court judgeship.

 The pain was so extreme the patient prayed to die and endured `` living hell for 40 minutes'' as he lay awake through gall bladder surgery, according to testimony at a medical negligence trial. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahls </PERSON> `` could n't move, he could n't talk, he could n't scream, he could n't do anything'' due to muscle relaxants and the insertion of a tube down his throat, attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strodel </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury during opening arguments Tuesday <ORGANIZATION> Wahls </ORGANIZATION> felt the surgeon cut into his abdomen, move several organs about and snip out his gall bladder, <PERSON> Strodel </PERSON> said, and should be compensated for the ordeal. The attorney contends the anesthesiologist, Dr. <PERSON> Kuo-Tung </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>, was negligent during the February 1987 operation at <ORGANIZATION> Proctor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` The evidence will not show that <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> is a bad doctor,'' <PERSON> Strodel </PERSON> said. `` He's not. But in this one case, he was negligent.'' <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, disputed the contention that <ORGANIZATION> Wahls </ORGANIZATION> felt extreme pain. `` There's no way he felt what he claims he felt,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said, adding `` I'm not here to tell you he did n't feel'' some discomfort or pain. He said <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> used the recommended dosage of anesthetic. <PERSON> Wahls </PERSON>, who lost consciousness later in the procedure, is seeking at least $ 15,000 in damages from <LOCATION> Cheng </LOCATION>. Wahls, a <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy coroner, contends he heard everything said by the surgical team during the first 40 minutes of surgery, including surgeons' remarks about his obesity and his professional honesty. <PERSON> Strodel </PERSON> paraphrased the remarks <PERSON> Wahls </PERSON> said he heard: `` He's a deputy coroner. You know what deputy coroners do. They get out before anybody else and rip off -LRB- steal from -RRB- dead bodies.'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wahls </PERSON>' obesity was a factor in deciding how deeply to sedate the patient without endangering his chances for safe recovery from the anesthetic. He said <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> administered as much of the anesthetic as the manufacturer recommended. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said expert anesthesiologists would prove <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>, who has practiced in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> for 14 years, was not negligent in his treatment of <LOCATION> Wahls </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Strodel </PERSON> said his own expert would use <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>'s own notes from the surgery to prove <ORGANIZATION> Wahls </ORGANIZATION> `` was aware'' during surgery and in pain.

 Conservative economist <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laffer </PERSON> on Wednesday questioned <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s goal of creating 30 million new jobs in eight years as president. At a news conference for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laffer </PERSON> said 20 million jobs in eight years might be an attainable figure. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s goal is `` a large number'' and an estimate `` that I would not have made,'' <PERSON> Laffer </PERSON> said. `` Whether 30 million is a reasonable or optimistic goal or not, the point is you want to keep those jobs going, keep that prosperity going,'' he said. The 48-year-old economist is best known for the `` Laffer Curve'' which holds that beyond a certain point, increasing taxes wo n't increase government revenues because high taxes slow down the economy <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked about creating 30 million new jobs in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> last week. He spoke of his goal of creating `` 30 in eight _ 30 million new jobs in the next eight years.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides retreated somewhat from the vice president's declaration. They said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used 30 million as a goal rather than a promise. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> recently projected a growth of 18.4 million jobs over the next 12 years. `` That 30 million I do n't think is a number you should focus on,'' <PERSON> Laffer </PERSON> said. `` Twenty million would get the point across.'' <PERSON> Laffer </PERSON>, a Californian and member of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, questioned <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' contribution as governor to the economic growth of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Laffer </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration created its own deficit problems by overestimating tax revenues in the state.

<TEXT>
 American efforts to switch to the metric system are set to get a major boost from a little-noted feature of the trade bill President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed into law this week, a congressman says. `` This metric provision could be one of the best kept secrets of the trade bill,'' Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., the sponsor, said Tuesday in a statement The law requires the federal government to start doing business with its private suppliers under the metric system _ centimeters instead of inches, kilograms instead of pounds and liters instead of gallons _ starting in 1992. A deliberate loophole has been left for cases in which the changeover would not be cost-effective. But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said a broad range of business could be affected by the measure. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Navas </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, called the provision `` outstanding'' and `` long-needed to accelerate the metric conversion process'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is now one of only three countries not using the metric system, based on the number 10. The other nations that have not adopted it are <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, he said. Some nations have made only a partial conversion. `` It's still 90 miles from <LOCATION> Stratford-on-Avon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, not kilometers,'' even though <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has adopted the system, <PERSON> Navas </PERSON> said. `` And football fields wo n't change to the metric system. I'd be against that, myself. There have been efforts to put the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the metric system for more than a decade, including 1975 legislation. But progress has been slow. Not everyone is thrilled with the idea. One opponent is the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Businesses </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> group whose 550,000 members around the country have an average of 10 employees and gross annual sales of around $ 350,000. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NFIB </ORGANIZATION> is opposed to a conversion to the metric system because quite frankly it's difficult,'' said chief <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehr </PERSON>. `` Given the size of their businesses it would be very costly both to convert to metric and, in the case of federal contracts, to make necessary adjustments.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that proponents were careful not to put the spotlight on the metric provisions in the legislation for fear of arousing more critics. `` Our strategy was to downplay the metric language in order to avoid confrontation with those who might oppose the measure without fully understanding its provisions,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Now that the trade bill is enacted, however, I want everyone to know that this country is finally taking real steps to convert to metric.''

 Federal engineers have opened an investigation of claims that the rear seat belts on 1.7 million Ford Escort and <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynx </ORGANIZATION> cars can cripple passengers in a crash, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. But the agency said the belts, which have an unusual design, comply with federal standards. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> granted part of a petition by a <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, couple, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, whose son was crippled in a 1985 accident while riding in a Ford Escort. The Garretts through their attorneys alleged a strap retainer causes the rear seat belts on the Escort and <ORGANIZATION> Lynx </ORGANIZATION> cars to ride up on the passenger's waist rather than settling around the hips, greatly increasing the likelihood of serious injury in accidents. In the event of a collision, they said, a seat belt over the waist cuts through softer parts of the body to the spinal column, while the hips provide a large mass of bone that enables a belt to hold a passenger in place without serious injury. The <ORGANIZATION> Garretts </ORGANIZATION> last December won a $ 3.3 million judgment against <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for their son's injuries. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> in a letter said, `` Based on the limited information gathered in our technical review, we are unable to conclude that the strap retainer has had an adverse effect on the performance of the system. `` However, testing did indicate that the Escort and <ORGANIZATION> Lynx </ORGANIZATION> rear safety belts with and without the strap retainer fit differently on test subjects compared to rear safety belts in some other cars.'' The agency said its investigation was needed `` to understand the safety effects of the different fit of these belts.'' <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s engineering analysis, a mid-level investigation, covers 1984-1988 Escort and <ORGANIZATION> Lynx </ORGANIZATION> cars. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said after the petition was filed that the seat belts were positioned properly during the <ORGANIZATION> Garretts </ORGANIZATION>' accident, and it attributed their son's crippling injury to the force of the crash. The automaker on Wednesday vowed to cooperate with <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation and expressed confidence the agency would find no safety-related defect in the belts The belts `` meet or exceed all federal lmotor vehicle safety standard performance requirements, including those for location, fit, strength and ease of use,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Garretts </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakayan </PERSON>, accused <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> of trying to put the case `` on the back burner for awhile'' in response to congressional critics. `` The letter they sent us today acknowledged there was a problem,'' <PERSON> Sakayan </PERSON> said. `` They acknowledge that the belt did n't fit the way it should They did n't tell us what the problem was? What are they waiting for if there was a problem?'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, then 11, was buckled into the back seat of the Escort when it crashed into a tractor-trailer truck near <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, Md. Two front-seat occupants were hospitalized but were spared crippling injuries, despite the crumpling of the passenger compartment in the head-on crash. <PERSON> James </PERSON> became a paraplegic as a result of injuries in the crash, and another back-seat passenger, 14-year-old <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaboury </PERSON>, was killed. While investigating the safety of the Escort and <ORGANIZATION> Lynx </ORGANIZATION> belts, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> continues to believe that `` you are far better off wearing any kind of belt than no belt at all,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFore </PERSON>, a spokesman for the agency.

 Heavy rains this month flooded about 25,000 people out of their homes on the isolated Caribbean coast and destroyed thousands of acres of subsistence crops, officials said Wednesday. <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tefel </PERSON>, Minister of <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>, said the majority of those affected are Indians who live mostly on corn and whatever else they can grow. He said 37 tons of food had been sent to the area and the government is asking the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> for help. Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> party, said <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> plan to donate food and other aid. The remote, jungled region is home to about 155,000 people, most of them Suma, <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> orMiskito Indians. Many of their wooden homes are built on stilts to avoid damage by floods when rivers rise during the rainy season. A preliminary survey by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> showed 90 percent of the area's crops were destroyed, <PERSON> Tefel </PERSON> said, and `` this means those 25,000 people will need food for the next six months.'' He said the leftist Sandinista government was short of funds because of economic difficulties created by the 7-year-old war the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backed rebels. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Salome Valle estimated 80 percent of the corn, yucca and bean crops were damaged. She said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> had provided shelter to about 3,000 people.

<TEXT>
 A conservative media watchdog group accused the four major television networks Wednesday of displaying `` blatant anti-conservative bias'' in their coverage of the Democratic and Republican nominating conventions this summer. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON>, founder and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said his group analyzed 100 hours of prime-time coverage on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> and found `` a seriously flawed double standard'' among the networks. The media `` let <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> get away with murder'' at the Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> by failing to report on issues, <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON> said. At the Republican convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, he said, `` the media spent too much time looking for scoops'' when they should have been reporting on issues. The <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> rated <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> best of the four networks it studied, followed by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS. <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON>'s group looked at the ideological labels network reporters and commentators used, their choice of who to interview, the types of questions they asked, which if any controversies they highlighted and whether the coverage was valuable to the viewer. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the controversial <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, was the subject of 432 of the 889 questions posed by network questioners during prime-time coverage of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> convention, <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON> said. Of 190 citations of all GOP controversies, he said, there were 140 mentions of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s service in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War. By comparison, he said, there were only four mentions of controversy during the Democratic convention. He said there were three comments about the ethics investigation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and one on vice presidential nominee Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s former fund-raising breakfast club for lobbyists <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON> said said the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> issue would not have come up 140 times if questions had been answered better initially. `` If the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> people had handled it better, there's no question'' that fewer questions would have been raised, he said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>, co-director of the non-partisan <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s selection during the convention made it inevitable that he would be scrutinized quickly and intensely by reporters. <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> blamed the focus on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> partly on the Republicans. `` The Republicans handed the material to the media, who then proceeded to tailor it,'' he said. `` If <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had had the right answers at the beginning, he could have defused a lot of this controversy.'' <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> has been analyzing <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> political coverage since the start of the primary season. He said network coverage of the two parties `` pretty well balanced out'' during the primaries.

 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> officially endorsed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president on Wednesday, and labor leaders said they can deliver the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat a margin of 2.5 million union votes in November. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the endorsement `` represents our commitment to work for you in every state in the union,'' but a spokesman for Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the endorsement `` a classic dog bites man story.'' The presidents of the labor federation's 91 affiliated unions voted 95.7 percent of their 14.1 million members in favor of a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> endorsement, with only three unions abstaining entirely. Not a single union worker was counted in the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> tally as favoring an endorsement of Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. However, among those unions abstaining was the largest, the 1.6 million-member Teamsters, who in 1980 and 1984 endorsed <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> after making no presidential endorsement in 1976. Newly installed Teamster President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, who sources in the union say personally dislikes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said he is withholding an endorsement until a mail poll of his members is completed Sept. 16. Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> could endorse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, an official in the union said, `` I just do n't see it.'' `` If the poll comes back strong for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, we'll probably endorse him,'' said the Teamster official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. `` If it's close, we'll probably remain neutral.'' The 30,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the 40,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> union also voted to abstain from making a presidential endorsement. The Newspaper Guild voted 4,000 of its 25,390 members as abstaining primarily because of opposition to any endorsement by its <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> local. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> had estimated earlier that the federation's endorsement of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984 was worth a net 2 million votes despite exit polls showing that as many as 47 percent of voters from union households cast their ballots then for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` Our rule of thumb is that we have to do two-thirds or better in order to be successful in the election,'' he said. `` We fell short of that. I'm reasonably confident that the results this time will be improved.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, calling the endorsement `` a classic dog-bites-man story,'' said, `` Every four years the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> trots out what has become an obligatory endorsement of a Democratic presidential candidate and 1988 is obviously no exception.'' Communications Workers President <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> said four polls of his union's members in the past year show that those who voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984 _ a slight majority, according to political operatives in the union _ `` are coming home to the Democratic party.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said a poll of his union's members in July and August at 28 sites showed 96.9 percent favoring a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> endorsement. `` Obviously we had a lot of people in 1980 and 1984 who made a mistake,'' <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said, citing the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the past seven years, including a 52 percent decline in farm and heavy equipment factories alone. `` The attitude of our members has changed.'' The 1.3 million-member <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which has a higher concentration of Republicans than most unions, said its latest telephone poll showed a two-to-one edge for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among those members who had made up their minds. `` For the first time in four years, a majority of our members classify themselves as Democrats with fewer than 24 percent calling themselves Republicans,'' said <ORGANIZATION> UFCW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, who noted that his union's members split even on <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> four years ago.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> visited black squatters Wednesday in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, met with Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and renewed his clemency appeal for the <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>, a group of blacks facing execution. The Illinois Democrat, on a five-day trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, conferred briefly with <PERSON> Prakash </PERSON> <PERSON> Diar </PERSON>, lawyer for the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six. The five men and one woman have been sentenced to hang for involvement in a mob that killed a black town councilor in 1984 in <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION>, a township south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Later, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> spent about 30 minutes with <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, leader of the Anglican church in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his campaign against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid system of race segregation. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> predicted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will toughen sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee on African affairs, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> will have a major role in that decision. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` would be eager to avoid sanctions if we got a good strong clear signal from the government here that they were going to do away with apartheid,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` But I'm not getting that signal.'' He contends that sanctions could push the white authorities toward reform. Before meeting <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> toured <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the black township of 2.5 million people outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. He also visited two squatter camps and an all-male hostel for migrant workers. `` I've just spoken with a man with five children who sees his family only once a year,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said after emerging from the hostel. `` This is an illustration of what happens under a system of injustice based on racial separation.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> also met with <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, a prominent anti-apartheid activist whose husband, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, is serving life in prison with fellow <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is leading a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign seeking clemency for the <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>, whose case has drawn worldwide attention. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has refused to intervene. They were granted a reprieve in March hours before they were to be executed. <PERSON> Diar </PERSON> will argue the case before the Appeal Court next month. His clients did not physically contribute to the death of the councilor, according to court testimony. They were convicted under the doctrine of `` common purpose,'' which holds them responsible for being an active part of the mob that carried out the killing. `` There is a feeling that the system has not provided justice for a great many people, and to some extent the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six are a symbol of that,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. He said his request to visit with the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six was turned down but he planned to mention the case in a scheduled meeting Thursday with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> skipper believes he acted properly in declining to take aboard a boatload of Vietnamese refugees who later reportedly turned to cannibalism to survive, the officer's attorney said Wednesday `` The captain is confident that what he did was correct given the facts and circumstances,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Petronio </PERSON>, the attorney for Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, who provided supplies to the refugees. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> faces a possible court-martial for alleged dereliction of duty. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> informed the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday that he would exercise his right not to attend an `` admiral's mast'' disciplinary hearing that had been scheduled for Wednesday before Vice Adm. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>'s surface forces. Under military law, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> now must decide whether to drop the matter or order an Article 32 hearing. Such a hearing, similar to a civilian grand jury proceeding, is the first step in a full military court-martial. `` It's not that he would not get a fair hearing, because he would have. But the nature of the -LRB- admiral's mast -RRB- proceedings are such that they're not public'' and <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>'s side of the story would not have come out, <PERSON> Petronio </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, who was skipper of the amphibious landing ship USS Dubuque, is charged with failing to render appropriate assistance to the refugees and violating a standing order to aid and rescue refugees found at sea in life-threatening situations. He was temporarily relieved of command Aug. 13. The charges were prepared for <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>'s administrative hearing and could be changed if a court-martial is ordered. According to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials, the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> encountered the refugee boat June 9 in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> while en route to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> gave the refugees several hundred pounds of supplies, including food, water and navigational aids, but did n't take the estimated 110 people aboard because he judged their vessel seaworthy, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The refugees, who left <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Tre </PERSON> in southern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on May 22, were at sea 37 days before fishermen from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> rescued them on June 28. Only 52 survived. Some of the survivors have been quoted as saying they killed and ate some of their fellow passengers to stay alive after they encountered the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> on June 9. Two of the victims reportedly died of starvation, but three others allegedly were murdered through drowning and then eaten. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION> are investigating the reports. <PERSON> Petronio </PERSON> said <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> would have no comment until the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decides whether or not to proceed with a court-martial. `` He's a very loyal <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer who's not going to buck the system,'' he said.

<HEAD>Federal Grant For AIDS Drug To Expire Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal payments for the drug AZT are running out for about 6,000 AIDS patients nationwide, and many may be forced into poverty to qualify for the life-prolonging drug under Medicaid, officials said Wednesday. A one-time, emergency appropriation of $ 30 million was enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last summer to help those AIDS patients who could n't afford the $ 8,000-a-year treatment, had inadequate health insurance and made too much money to qualify for Medicaid About a fifth of all AIDS patients in the country are receiving AZT under the grant, according to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. AZT, or azidothymidine, has been shown to prolong the lives of some AIDS patients but has severe side effects. Because few states have taken action to continue funding, many of those patients may be forced to `` spend down until they reach Medicaid level,'' <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> said. `` You use your own resources until you're out of money and you qualify for Medicaid, which can be pretty devastating,'' he said. `` That's what's going to happen, I have no doubt about it.'' AIDS activists have criticized the states for not continuing the program. The federal program technically expires Sept. 30 when the government's fiscal year ends, but states with surpluses at that time will be allowed to continue supporting their AIDS patients until their AZT money runs out, officials said. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the money has already run out, despite extra funds voted by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made it very clear to the states that they needed to pick up the slack once this -LRB- federal -RRB- program expired,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is unfortunate that the states have waited until the last minute to react.'' <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enact `` some type of matching program'' during the transition to state funding. `` It does n't make a lot of economic sense to have people who are working to stop working ... and go on Social Security so they can get Medicaid to get a very expensive drug that may not work,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. So far, only the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> has actually appropriated money to continue the program after the grant expires, <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> said. The fiscal 1989 budget includes $ 250,000 for emergency drug assistance, says <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, who administers the district's AIDS office. However, the district's budget still must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. While no state has acted to continue AZT funding for all those receiving it under the grant, six states _ <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ have changed their Medicaid rules to cover the drug for the poorest patients. Only in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> is AZT not paid for by Medicaid. The $ 30 million AZT grant was disbursed proportionately among the states based on the number of AIDS patients as of July 1987. Money from some states that had overestimated their need was later transferred to other states. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which has more AIDS cases than any other state, got the most, about $ 8.5 million, and has helped about 900 patients so far. According to <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> McTague </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s AIDS Drug Assistance Program, the money is expected to last a year beyond the grant expiration. As a result, there is as yet no legislative push to come up with state money to continue to program, she said. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> said most states with surpluses will be allowed to keep the money provided it is spent on AZT. Normally, unspent grant money must be returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was next with $ 7.6 million for 1,500 patients. It was followed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which got $ 2.1 million to treat 520 patients, according to <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Marler </PERSON>, the AZT coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. She said the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, which convenes in January, will be asked to provide state money for AIDS treatment. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> got the fourth largest grant of $ 1.7 million, and later received an additional $ 329,000 from states where the money was not needed. When the state still overspent the grants in treating about 630 patients over the year, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> appropriated an extra $ 278,000. Still, <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was forced to discontinue the grant program about five weeks ago. The deficit stemmed primarily from the fact that until July 1, Medicaid in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> did not pay for AZT.

 Two executives of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> marketing firm and three other people have been indicted on charges of rigging <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> promotional contests and awarding prizes to friends and relatives. Prizes involved in the alleged scheme included a $ 14,000 Mustang, a $ 28,500 Corvette and $ 25,000 in cash, according to Tuesday's 13-count indictment. The games were sold by C & amp; K Marketing to the <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> supermarket chain and the <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> fast-food chain, but neither Alpha Beta nor <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> took part in the fraud, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>. Named in the indictment were C & amp; K's president, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>; vice president <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissane </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Brielle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; auto dealer <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baratta </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Au </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The defendants were scheduled to be arraigned in federal court here Sept. 6. The indictment alleges mail fraud, wire fraud, aiding and abetting and use of misleading conduct. The Alpha Beta game was called `` <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreamin </ORGANIZATION>''' and <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s game was dubbed `` Wheels, Reels and Meals.'' The indictment said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> gave his friend <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> the winning ticket for the Mustang in the Alpha Beta contest in 1985 and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kissane </PERSON> rigged the <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> game the following year to make <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> the winner of the Corvette. In the <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> game, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> elected to take $ 28,500 in cash instead of the car, but his victory was on paper only and the marketing company kept the money, the indictment alleged. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> acknowledged winning the Mustang and selling it for $ 12,000, but he declined to say if <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> had given him the winning ticket. He declined to comment further. <PERSON> Baratta </PERSON>, a relative of <PERSON> Kissane </PERSON>, was the arranged winner of a $ 25,000 second prize in the <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> game and the money actually went back to the company, according to the indictment. <PERSON> Baratta </PERSON> said he was unaware the contest was a setup. The Curtins and <PERSON> Kissane </PERSON> declined comment.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> renewed his criticism of rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' stand on the Pledge of Allegiance on Wednesday, accusing the Democrat of `` looking for a reason'' to avoid signing a bill requiring teachers and students to say the pledge. `` What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so much?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> queried at a high-voltage pep rally, where he was joined by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in their first post-GOP convention campaign appearance. `` I would have signed that bill,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Let's face it _ my opponent was looking for a reason not to sign that bill _ I would have looked for a reason to sign it.'' Battered by questions over the military record of his running mate Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., during their first week of campaigning, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared intent on focusing the attention elsewhere <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s renewed emphasis on the issue came one day after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` dedication to the Constitution and the rule of law'' on the matter. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` no business'' running for the White House if he was willing to sign a bill that he knew to be unconstitutional. The vice president used the pledge to wrap up his acceptance speech to the Republican convention. And twice recently, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faulted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at campaign appearances because the governor vetoed a bill in 1977 that would have penalized any school teacher who failed to lead students in the pledge every morning. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he rejected the bill because the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declared the law unconstitutional. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used his appearance with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to argue the matter should be decided by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I find it hard to believe that the Founding Fathers would have objected to teachers leading students in the Pledge of Allegiance,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president also faulted his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rival with being weak on defense and crime as well as eager to raise taxes. `` We ca n't take another gamble'' by putting a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor like <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contended. `` We must have tough, experienced leadership ... which someone who's been there and someone you can trust _ I am that man,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has appeared several times in his home state to press the cause of his vice president. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with its rich deployment of 47 electoral votes, is seen by both campaigns as essential for winning the White House. In his remarks to the crowd of several thousand at the Century Plaza Hotel, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will shift gears smoothly from being a loyal No. 2 to being a strong president because he is `` a man of action _ a man accustomed to command.'' The president argued that being a loyal No. 2 is n't always a simple job. `` The vice presidency does n't fit easily on such a man. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is also a patriot. And so he made it fit and he served with a distinction no one has ever matched,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` I once said that he is a great vice president, but I know and I've seen that it did n't come easily. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a man of action _ a man accustomed to command,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was comfortable with the idea of passing on the mantle of chief executive to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I have seen him keep a cool head in hot crises. I have seen his leadership and vision. I have given him some of the most sensitive and difficult tasks we've had, and he has never let me or the country down,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lambasted the Democratic ticket as `` a three-headed ticket that does n't know left from center,'' an apparent reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his running mate Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, and Democratic runner-up <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also tried to offer a boost to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s troubled campaign, dogged by questions over his entry into the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and his relationship with a female lobbyist on a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> golfing trip. `` I'd say <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has a great candidate ... and I must confess I like his running mate, too,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in comments that were not included in his prepared remarks. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stands for the same principles as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I do,'' the president said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared together at the noisy pep rally after conferring privately for about 15 minutes. Besides <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., attending the rally were actor <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, actress <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>, singer <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> and comedian <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, who quipped that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> can `` not only be our vice president, he can be our national bird.

<HEAD>A Top Ticket Price of $55 for New Broadway Musical</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Top seats for `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway Dances,'' featuring dance numbers from some of <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' biggest hits, will cost $ 55 when the $ 7 million musical opens early next year, it was announced Wednesday. `` We are limited to one source of income in the theater _ the box office,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Shubert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which is co-producing the show. `` It's a question of economics, and this is a lavish show.'' The current top ticket price on Broadway is $ 50, the going rate for such musical hits as `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' `` <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miserables </LOCATION>,'' `` Cats,'' `` Me and My Girl'' and `` Into the Woods.'' By any standards, `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway Dances,' which begins preview performances at the Imperial Theater Jan. 16 and officially opens Feb. 26, is a mammoth undertaking. <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON> said the musical has a cast of 60 and is expected to include production numbers from such <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' shows as `` Fiddler on the Roof,'' `` West Side Story,'' `` Gypsy,'' `` On the Town,'' `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON>,'' `` The King and I,'' and `` High Button Shoes.'' In some of the shows, he was the choreographer and in others he was both director and choreographer. Adding to the cost is the musical's unusually long rehearsal period of 22 weeks, compared with six to eight weeks for most musicals. `` Broadway Dances,'' which features a cast of relative unknowns, began rehearsals Aug. 15. In addition, <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON> said, it took <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> six months to research and reconstruct the dance numbers, interviewing many of the original performers in his shows as well as watching videotapes of the original productions. <PERSON> Schoenfeld </PERSON> said the show would need to gross $ 420,000 a week to break even, and would need to play more than 60 weeks at capacity to pay back its $ 7 million investment. Although the show would be the first regular Broadway production to crack the $ 50-a-ticket barrier, the limited-run, eight-hour production of `` <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickleby </PERSON>'' cost $ 100 a ticket.

 The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombed an armored police car Wednesday and announced a sophisticated new terror strategy to go with its summer blitz against the British army that has killed 26 soldiers. Explosives packed in a parked van blew the patrolling police car across a road at <LOCATION> Maghera </LOCATION>, 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, slightly injuring the two officers inside, police said. The incident resembled the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bombing of a military bus Saturday near <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION>, about 30 miles away, which killed eight British soldiers and injured 27. It came a day after a car bomb blew up in the center of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, shattering windows and possibly signalling a return by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> to the `` commercial war'' of the 1970s that devastated the city center. A telephoned warning enabled police to evacuate the area, and the only casualty of the 400-pound bomb was a pregnant woman who suffered minor injuries, police said. Police said gunmen burst into a children's birthday party in Roman Catholic west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on Tuesday, held five adults and four children, and stole the family van for use as a car bomb. It said the captives were released unharmed after the bomb exploded at <LOCATION> Maghera </LOCATION>. Police said they were questioning several people arrested in the <LOCATION> Maghera-Omagh </LOCATION> area about `` serious terrorist crimes.'' In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, dozens of homes were evacuated while police checked two other suspected car bombs that turned out to be harmless. The British government claims the regime of <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has given the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> high-quality arms, anti-aircraft missiles and Czech-made explosives. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to discuss anti-IRA strategy with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. King told NBC News: `` The injection by Col. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> of more powerful explosives and additional weapons may have given some people the idea that somehow violence can actually win.'' Following the two-hour meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said some matters that had been resolved `` will become apparent shortly in various ways.'' He declined to give further details and said more meetings with the prime minister were planned because other unspecified issues `` will require further detailed work.'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said the government faced `` a serious, vicious terrorist challenge'' which would be met. In statements issued through the legal <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday's car bomb was aimed at the <ORGANIZATION> Windsor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office block. It also announced a new strategy for bombing `` commercial and administrative property'' at minimal risk to civilians. In future car bombings, a smoke grenade would go off, simultaneously warning bystanders and sensitizing the bomb to any attempt to defuse it, the group said. A renewed bombing campaign in central <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> would be a blow to rejuvenating its commercial and entertainment heart, which the government sees as crucial to returning life to normal. Late-night shopping has played a major role in stimulating business confidence, proving so popular among violence-weary <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> residents that the law has been changed to allow two late-night shopping days a week instead of one. The government faces demands to crack down harder on the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, following a series of attacks on British soldiers in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this summer. The most recent was a bomb Monday that killed a navy officer as he was driving into <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Among measures being proposed are locking up suspects without trial, changing the law to deny suspects the right to remain silent and outlawing the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s political wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>. Except for changing special license plates on the cars of British soldiers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to make them less identifiable, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and King have refused to disclose what measures might be taken, saying they do n't want to tip the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said: `` Attempting to defeat the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is not a viable or sensible option despite <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and King's bravado. In a statement, he said: `` The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> people need to ask if there is not another way. They need to ask why the question of their government's immoral claim to a part of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is constantly being forcibly rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> which their government claims to have defeated.'' The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to rid <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, with its <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> majority, of British rule and unite the province with the 95 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` shocked'' Wednesday at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s planned deportation of 25 Palestinian Arabs, and sources said the administration would not lend its usual support to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if the issue arises in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> complained that the deportation move `` appears to make expulsion the norm rather than the exception.'' `` We are shocked by the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s decision,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. She stressed the numbers involved distressed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government most. `` As a strong friend of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> we are deeply concerned over the widening use of expulusions,'' she said. Diplomatic sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> notified <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> it would be obliged to take this position in conflict with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s if the deportation issue reached the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The two governments have differed only infrequently before the world body, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has often rescued <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from condemnation over various policies and actions. But the sources, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had informed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> the dispute was harmful to U.S.-Israeli relations. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said she was not `` speculating on the strength of what we all consider to be a very strong relationship.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman added: `` Our friendship and close association with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> continues. But what we are saying is that this is an issue of concern and we've expressed these concerns to the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said enforcement of the expulsion orders would mean a total of 60 Palestinian Arabs were deported this year. The statement did not specifically condemn all expulsions or question <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s attempt to maintain order on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> in the face of rising unrest among the 1.5 million Palestinian inhabitants. However, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on several occasions has publicly urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> not to use expulsions as a punishment for criminal acts but rather to apply the regular process of charging and trying suspects based on evidence. The last such <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement was made by Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> last Friday even as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was in the midst of moving against the Palestinians. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> on Monday summoned Deputy Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Oded </PERSON> <PERSON> Eran </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to convey <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unhappiness with the deportations. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON>, the Israeli embassy spokesman, defended the policy on Tuesday as a `` measure of last resort'' in dealing with agitation. He said the expulsions were carried out `` in conformity with the law of the land and subject to review by the Israeli high court.'' The Israeli spokesman said the purpose was `` to try to ensure public safety'' and that expulsions were ordered `` only when we are convinced it is the best way to handle the instigators and inciters'' of violence in the territories. Despite the disagreement, <PERSON> Gal </PERSON> said on Wednesday there was `` no crisis'' in <LOCATION> U.S.-Israeli </LOCATION> relations. At least 252 Palestinian Arabs and 4 Israeli have died in the disorders that broke out last December. Meanwhile, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has made four trips to the region this year to try to promote <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations over the Palestinians. His missions foundered over <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Jordanian resistance to hold talks on a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement under the terms proposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. With <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on vacation, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> is in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In his session with <PERSON> Eran </PERSON>, he `` was speaking for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government as he does in any situation like this,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tucked away the endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and promised strong business-labor relations backed by a president who is `` an economic leader, not a cheerleader.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in speeches to the labor group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and a college audience in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, said that more Americans are working now than ever before. But he said the new jobs created during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration have been low paying and average family income stands where it was 20 years ago. `` That's the price our workers and their familes are paying for voodoo economics,'' the Democratic presidential nominee said, resurrecting a line <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used against <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980. `` I have met too many young people who have accepted jobs over the last eight years that pay less than their old jobs,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a speech at Grand Valley State University. `` I have met too many couples who are working harder at two jobs just to stay in place.'' The Democratic presidential nominee criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to create 30 million new jobs if elected to two terms as president, a pledge senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ecomonic advisers have conceded may be overly optimistic. `` This election is not about whether Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own economists believe his speeches,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It is about making every American a full shareholder in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. It's about creating jobs with a future, jobs you can count on, jobs you can raise a family on.'' It was the second consecutive day <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has directly criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has no experience as a chief executive and also said the vice president was unfit for the presidency if he would sign a law mandating recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools even if advised that it was unconstitutional. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chastised the vice president for not mentioning the trade and budget deficits in his speech to the Republican convention. `` And to add insult to injury, he wants to cut taxes for the wealthy again,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` My friends, if this were a movie, we'd call it ` son of voodoo.''' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had failed when sent to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1983 to improve trade relations. He also criticized both <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for suddenly supporting the trade bill signed by the president Tuesday. `` Trade is an issue which requires presidential leadership each day _ not just 77 days before a presidential election,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` In 1983, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was put in charge of managing our trade problems with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, when the trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was $ 22 billion. After visiting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and meeting with Japanese government officials, he came home, declaring U.S.-Japanese trade relations were ` superb.' Since then, our trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has tripled.'' He also touched on several fronts important to labor, promising to help foster improved management-labor relations and to strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want to be able to say that there's a new spirit of determination in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a new economic patriotism that brings us together as one people, one nation, helping us to compete _ and win _ in the world market,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` My friends, the next president of the <LOCATION> Unites </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be an economic leader, not a cheerleader,'' he said. `` He must do more than talk about creating more jobs, he must be a president who knows how to build a strong economy _ and has done it. A president who knows how to create and save jobs _ and has done it. A president who has the strength and the vision and the values to build a strong economy and a vibrant future for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Pollsters: Quayle Controversy May Limit Bush's Bounce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s boost from the Republican National Convention shows signs of decaying as quickly as it arose, a victim of the controversy surrounding running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, pollsters said Wednesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rebounded to at best a narrow lead in public opinion polls this week after badly trailing the Democratic nominee, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, last month. But new polls indicate that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bounce may have peaked virtually as soon as it began. Two polls Wednesday put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead by leads so slim they were within the margins of error _ 44-39 in an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll done Saturday through Monday and 49-47 in a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll done Friday to Monday. `` I think he's been hurt in the long run for the race,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON>, a Gallup Organization pollster. `` As this reporting takes hold, there has to be some negative consequence for the Bush-Quayle ticket.'' News reports since the GOP convention last week have been dominated by questions about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s entry into the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war and about a former female lobbyist's claim he propositioned her in 1980. Those issues arose at a critical time in the campaign, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needed to capitalize on the positive response to his acceptance speech by keeping attention focused on his themes, pollsters said. `` If you hit a high note you've got to keep hitting it, because the public is n't paying attention and it needs to have that constantly reinforced,'' said <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, a CBS News pollster. `` The good news that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is trying to continue to pump out is getting lost in this Quayle thing.'' The result: In a Gallup poll conducted Thursday and Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by nine percentage points. But in a Gallup poll done Friday through Sunday, he led by just four points, a dead heat because of the margin of error. Similarly, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led by six points, also within the error margin, in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted Friday through Sunday. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support was strongest Friday and seemed to wane as the weekend progressed. It was expected that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would receive a boost in popularity as a result of television coverage of the Republican convention, just as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won a bounce from the Democratic convention in mid-July. The partisan speechmaking and careful choreography of modern conventions reliably lift their nominees in the polls, albeit temporarily. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> questions arose even before the convention closed. <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON> likened the effect to the 1976 debate in which President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> contended that Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is not under Soviet domination; initial polls found no effect, but <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> soon suffered as news reports stressed the gaffe. `` This will turn out to be one of those events, like the 1976 debate, that will be cited as a major explanatory factor for either a narrow -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- loss or a victory which could have been bigger, given the boost that he should have received from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> performance of the past eight years,'' <PERSON> Traugott </PERSON> said. `` It will become part of the folklore of the 1988 election.'' While <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s misstatement reflected on himself, pollsters doubted that concerns about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> personally were harming the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket, because voters tend to decide exclusively on the presidential nominees. `` People repeatedly say the vice presidential choice does n't matter,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>, pollster for ABC News `` If the vice presidential candidate ca n't help very much, then it's equally difficult for him to hurt very much.'' Instead, others said, the apparent damage stems from a lack of positive publicity for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign coming out of the convention. With voters somewhat unfamiliar with the nominees and not strongly committed to either one, negative developments _ such as the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> questions _ can strongly influence the electorate, at least briefly, they said. That is not to say polls now can predict the election's outcome. Measures of underlying public attitudes for months have indicated a close contest, even as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rose to an 18-point lead on the tide of publicity from his convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' bounce was greater and lasted longer than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s, but some polls put the race back at a tie even before the Republicans met. `` Bounce is not momentum. Momentum implies you're going to continue on indefinitely,'' <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said. `` Bounce means you're going to rise, you're going to fall And the fall can be as quick as the rise is.'' The NBC-Journal poll was conducted Saturday through Monday among 1,762 registered voters, the <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll Friday through Monday among 1,310 likely voters. Both had error margins of plus or minus three points.

 A spokesman for Kurdish rebels said Wednesday that Iraqi troops were massing for an all-out offensive against the guerrillas, who are supported by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Western diplomats in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday the Iraqis were taking advantage of a cease-fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to step up operations against the rebels. `` A bloody massacre is awaiting the 150,000 civilians trapped in the area,'' the spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said in a telephone call from a Western European city he did not identify. `` We believe the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> authorities will use chemical weapons. This is a matter of life and death for us.'' The Iraqis were planning large-scale operations `` in all the Kurdish liberated zones'' along the entire 220-mile border with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the rebel spokesman told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in the telephone call to <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. He spoke on condition his name not be used because of `` security reasons.'' He said many Iraqi army troops were gathering in the northern cities in <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dahok </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zakho </LOCATION> and predicted fierce fighting in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> when the offensive is launched, but he did not say when that might happen. About 20 million Kurds are spread across the mountainous region where the borders of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> meet. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Kurds have been fighting for a separate homeland for more than 50 years. The Kurdish <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and other Kurdish factions, backed by Iranian Revolutionary Guards, escalated their war against <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> two years ago. Their attacks created a second war front in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, pinning down tens of thousands of Iraqi troops badly needed in the main battlefields farther south. But in recent months the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army has pushed the Iranians out of their footholds in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and intensified pressure on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The Kurds said the Iraqis intensified their attacks on rebel forces a week before the cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> took effect Aug. 20. The recent Iraqi offensive, involving about 50,000 troops, has brought about a dramatic reversal in the guerrillas' fortunes. They now appear to be trapped between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the Turkish border to the north. The Turks, who are also fighting the Kurds, have been reported to deploy large numbers of their own troops along the frontier, apparently in collaboration with <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. The rebel spokesman said the movement's leader, <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON>, has appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> for immediate assistance to Kurdish refugees and called on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to protect them. Kurdish officials and Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> say the Iraqis have razed hundreds of villages in recent months and forcibly moved about 150,000 civilians to camps in the south. <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON>, son of the famous Kurdish general <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON> who died 18 months ago, also has called on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and world leaders to intercede with <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to halt its `` genocide'' against the Kurds. He has said the Iraqis have thrust deep into the Kurdish stronghold, using poison gas, air strikes and scorched earth tactics. Kurdish officials list nearly 30 chemical attacks on villages in recent months. Charges that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has used chemical weapons, outlawed under a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, are difficult to confirm. However, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has reported at least some use of chemical arms by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed 4,000 Kurdish civilians were killed in the town of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> when the Iraqis dropped poison gas bombs in February. Western correspondents who visited the town, captured by pro-Iranian forces, reported seeing the bodies of hundreds of men, women and children. Kurdish alarm has deepened with the cease-fire. Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leaders meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Thursday for peace talks were expected to seek guarantees that both sides will halt support for opposition forces. Moreover, the guerrillas have long been suspicious of their Iranian ally. Both the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> and current <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> tried to crush Kurdish groups inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before the war made them allies. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, reported Wednesday that <PERSON> Yar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, leader of an Iraqi-backed Kurdish faction, was publicly hanged in the western town of <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION> Monday.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman cleared of terrorism charges after being imprisoned in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> dodged reporters upon her arrival in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Wednesday after saying she wanted to go sightseeing and visit family here. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, 40, a native of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, was the only passenger to leave a Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, at <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION> airport 128 miles west of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, airline officials said. Immigration officials said she was allowed to enter the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> on her American passport. She eluded waiting reporters at <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION> by mingling with about 200 passengers from another flight and slipping out a side door. Ms. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> earlier said she would move on from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to meet friends and eventually hoped to find a job teaching English somewhere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. She was imprisoned for nearly five months in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> on charges of taking part in an August 1987 rebel attack in <LOCATION> Vilcashuaman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> state, by the Maoist Shining Path movement. Two government workers were killed. She said she was a tourist, had no ties with the rebels and had nothing to do with the attack. Her lawyers, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and survivors of the attack and other witnesses backed her up. A <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> court cleared her April 26, but she was rearrested on the same charges Aug. 2 when she went to a police station for permission to leave the country. She was held in jail until Monday night, but was finally freed after an <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> court ruled she could not be tried twice for the same crime, her lawyer said. `` My name is cleared. I feel relieved,'' Ms. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> told reporters before leaving <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> Tuesday. Peruvian police first arrested her on Dec. 5.

<DATELINE>MESQUITE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The press has taken a nearby hill, christened it `` Fort Mesquite'' and settled in for a long wait _ but a friend staying with <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> at an apartment here says the media siege wo n't work. `` She is still here, but she does n't want to talk to anybody,'' said a woman who identified herself only as <PERSON> Cori </PERSON> and as a niece of Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s roommate, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON>, who was arrested Friday after a domestic disturbance. `` She's not going to say anything for a long time.'' But <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area reporters and photographers and network TV crews are keeping an unblinking eye on the second-story apartment of the ex-lobbyist, who has become a thorn in the side of the vice presidential nominee, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Neighbors say the press began circling, cameras in hand, outside Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s apartment late last week, even before the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> reported that two former attorneys for Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> quoted her as telling the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had propositioned her on a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> golfing holiday. Then Playboy magazine announced Tuesday that an article in its November edition will include a statement about the incident from Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, who says she rebuffed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s advance because she was with another congressman, then-Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Del `` We flirted a lot and danced extremely close and suggestively,'' Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> was quoted by Playboy. `` He said he wanted to make love.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who has denied any relationship with Mrs. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, said Tuesday he is tiring of questions about her and his National Guard service. `` This is getting a little bit outrageous and I'm getting a little bit indignant about just one bum rap after another,'' he said Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, who was interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as part of an investigation into whether sexual favors were being traded for votes against legislation opposed by her employer, has refused to come to her apartment door. She did accept a list of prepared questions from one reporter only to send them back outside without answering them. `` The residents here feel like it's an invasion of their privacy, too,'' said an apartment manager, who refused to be identified. `` They are n't real thrilled about having all these cameras around.'' Mesquite police said <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> was arrested after a disturbance at the apartment complex. He was being held Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Lew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sterrett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in lieu of $ 2,000 bail on charges of driving without a license, possession of marijuana and driving while intoxicated. He also was being held for state prison authorities for investigation of a possible parole violation. Ms. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, who changed her name back to her maiden name <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Laham </PERSON> following a 1984 divorce from <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, has held a number of short-term jobs since the original <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sex scandal and an ensuing appearance in Playboy. She also has had legal problems, The Dallas Morning News reported in its Tuesday editions. She was arrested for public intoxication twice in 1985, with one case being dismissed and the other probated for 90 days. Then last December, she pleaded guilty to a charge of driving under the influence and was placed on probation for two years, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Mountain Climbers Rescued After Reports of Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rescuers found a mountain-climbing party of five Frenchmen, one Canadian and two Bolivians on Wednesday, the day after their guide reported what he described as a guerrilla attack. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON>, acting interior minister, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the climbers were expected in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> on Thursday and police were continuing to investigate. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderete </PERSON>, interior undersecretary, said earlier: `` We do not yet have a clear picture of the situation but the first information indicates it is a group linked to the Peruvian Shining Path guerillas.'' <PERSON> Berfardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarachi </PERSON>, the Bolivian guide, said 16 heavily armed men surrounded the climbing party's base camp Monday at about 15,000 feet in the <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Guarachi </PERSON> said he heard shots before escaping down a glacier. <PERSON> Guarachi </PERSON> said Tuesday that the men communicated with walkie-talkies and five wore khaki uniforms. After the climbers were found, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> said a preliminary investigation indicated they were surrounded by armed Indians who may have been hunting and there was no evidence of guerrilla involvement. He said military aircraft flew over the site and helicopter pilots found the camp abandoned Tuesday, raising concern among officials. Paititi, the travel agency that handled the expedition, said the foreign climbers were experienced and the two Bolivians worked for the agency. <PERSON> Guarachi </PERSON> is a veteran mountaineer who was the first to reach an airliner that crashed on <PERSON> Illimani </PERSON> mountain in 1984. The Shining Path, a Maoist group, began fighting in the Peruvian Andes eight years ago and the guerrilla war has cost more than 15,000 lives. No guerrilla operations have been reported in the <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> and no people live near the base camp.

 Police arrested two officials of a leftist newspaper the government has linked to Shining Path, the 8-year-old Maoist guerrilla group, a lawyer and several <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> dailies said Wednesday. Lawyer <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Crespo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON>, editor and administrator respectively of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diario </LOCATION>, were arrested Tuesday while seeking the release of five people detained during a raid on a printing plant the newspaper uses.

Police confirmed a raid at the time but have refused comment since. <PERSON> Crespo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>, said anti-insurgency police were holding <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Amal Militia Reports Seizing Six Spies Operating for Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Shiite Moslem militia <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had captured six members of a spy network working for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> militia allies, and showed them to journalists. The suspects were displayed at Amal headquarters in <LOCATION> Zefta </LOCATION>, six miles northwest of <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The five men and a woman said they spied for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION> secret service and made bombing attacks on the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> army in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> under orders from a liaison `` espionage officer'' they identified as a Lebanese named <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasr </PERSON>. Amal, a pro-Syrian militia, did not say what it intended to do with the prisoners. The suspects are Shiites who belong to the <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> family, but their relationship to each other was not clear. They said they warned the Mossad about several guerrilla operations being prepared against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains a `` security zone'' just north of the Lebanese border, ranging in depth from 6 to 10 miles, with the aid of a surrogate militia called the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON>, a Lebanese army soldier, said he had passed on information about battalions stationed in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1987. Another of the group, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON>, confessed to two bombing attacks on the Syrian army, which patrols <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector to prevent factional warfare.

<TEXT>
 Talks to bring peace, ease tensions and limit weapons are under way throughout the world, giving rise to hope in many regions where problems until recently seemed intractable. Here is a glance at talks on the Iran-Iraq War, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.

<TEXT>
 IRAN-IRAQ _ <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are scheduled to begin peace talks Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sponsorship. An Aug. 20 cease-fire was arranged under a year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution. These will be first talks since the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war began in September 1980. Up to 1 million people have been killed, and damage totals hundreds of billions of dollars. The biggest long-term problem is the border dispute, a major cause of the war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says the border was agreed upon in a 1975 treaty made with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> by the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, overthrown in 1979 and replaced by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> repudiated the treaty days before its 1980 invasion of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which had followed several border skirmishes.

 <LOCATION> CYPRUS </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> leaders agreed Wednesday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to meet Sept. 15 in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, for unconditional talks to reunify their divided <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island. At issue is the Turkish-occupied part of the island, which <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> alone recognizes as independent. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' problems were aggravated by intercommunal clashes in 1963 that led to use of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force. In 1974, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded and occupied 37 percent of the island. Negotiations broke down in 1985 over demands of withdrawal of 30,000 Turkish troops from north <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Outstanding issues involve the powers of any central government on the island and repatriation of refugees.

 <LOCATION> ANGOLA </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators held separate sessions in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> with South African, Cuban and Angolan officials Wednesday in advance of talks to determine a timetable for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, the Angolan capital, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said the possibility of peace in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has never been greater since rebels began fighting the Portuguese for independence in 1961. Cuban troops support the Angolan government in fighting U.S.-and South African-backed <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels. The civil war has been going on since <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> won independence in 1975. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and its leader, <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, are not involved in the talks. The Marxist government of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> refuses to negotiate with the rebels, who say they wo n't adhere to the cease-fire signed Monday by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> KOREA </LOCATION> _ North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials said Thursday they were willing to resume talks this week on sharing next month's Olympic Games and on developing a non-aggression pact. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials say <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is trying to distract world attention from the Olympics, set for Sept. 17-Oct. 2 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> says it wants to co-host the Games, but Olympic officials say the Games belong to a single city. The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the peninsula was divided at the end of World War II.

<TEXT>
 Backers of bringing the 1994 Winter Olympics to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s largest city said Wednesday that voters boosted their effort, while <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> rallied behind a first-time candidate who won a crowded race to oppose a first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman. In <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, voters agreed by a 2-to-1 margin Tuesday to assume financial responsibility for the Games. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> voters also narrowed the field for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s sole seat in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and all five <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> congressmen who faced challengers in Tuesday's primary won renomination. The <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> vote gives the city a good lobbying position when it goes before the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> next month in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nerland </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the numbers that we're seeing now are impressive numbers to the <ORGANIZATION> IOC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Nerland </PERSON> said. The ballot question asked whether the municipality should cover any unanticipated debts incurred by staging the Games. With 79 of 91 precincts reported Wednesday, the vote was 26,365 in favor and 13,878 against, or 66 percent to 34 percent. The Anchorage organizers had said they needed a clear majority to impress the <ORGANIZATION> IOC </ORGANIZATION>, though they are not sure how much weight the vote will carry in the international competition. The nine-member <ORGANIZATION> IOC </ORGANIZATION> is to choose in September between <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Lillehammer </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>; Ostersund-Are, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> primary, eight-term Republican <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruenstein </PERSON>, making his first try for a statewide office, advance to the general election. Young handily defeated Republican challenger <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> employee from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. With 94 percent of the votes counted Wednesday, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> had 50,958 votes, or 55.2 percent, to <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>'s 4,977 votes, 5.3 percent. <PERSON> Gruenstein </PERSON> drew 32,375 votes, or 35 percent, to pull ahead of two Democratic contenders. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Vick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> got 2,474 votes, 2.6 percent. <PERSON> Ryal </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> had 1,503 votes, 1.6 percent of the total. In <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, freshman Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Inhofe </PERSON> faced no Republican challengers Tuesday, but this fall faces <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Glassco </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> lawyer making his first run for political office. <PERSON> Glassco </PERSON>, a one-time aide to former Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigh </PERSON>, won the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nomination Tuesday with 60 percent of the vote despite a crowded field that included four other candidates. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Inhofe </PERSON> is going to have his hands full'' with <PERSON> Glassco </PERSON>, predicted <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, an aide at the Democrat's state headquarters in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Democrats say <PERSON> Inhofe </PERSON>, a first-term congressman, has been ineffective in representing his district, but Republicans expressed confidence <PERSON> Inhofe </PERSON> would prevail. `` It may be close, it may be a blowout,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, adding that `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Inhofe </PERSON> has built a very conservative record up there.'' Republicans also are touting <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a lawyer making his first run for political office, in the fall race against Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON>, who got 84 percent of the vote Tuesday over one rival. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would campaign on economic issues such as jobs.

 The mayor of an Israeli town where arsonists killed three Palestinians apologized to a victim's family Wednesday in an attempt to patch up strained Arab-Jewish relations `` What happened really shocked me,'' <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukovza </PERSON>, mayor of Or Yehuda near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, told relatives of <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Abadlah </PERSON> during a visit to their home in this central <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town. `` It's a -LRB- religious -RRB- commandment to bring the spirit of peace and express our will to live together,'' <PERSON> Bukovza </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abadlah </PERSON>'s three brothers listened with tears in their eyes and accepted the mayor's apology. But they also demanded harsh punishment for the arsonists and better protection for Arab workers in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Three Palestinians laborers sleeping in a construction site shack in Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> were killed when assailants set the hut on fire Aug. 8. Three Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> residents are being held in the attack. Police said the assailants were not out to attack <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, but to take revenge on a Jewish contractor who refused to give them work. Earlier this week, police detained four Arabs suspected of hurling smoke bombs and firebombs at an Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> home to avenge the arson. However, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported Wednesday that police detained two Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> residents, ages 20 and 30, on suspicion of carrying out the attack for which the four Arabs were held. The report said one of the suspects lives in the apartment building where the bombs were thrown. Their aim was to provoke neighbors to expel Palestinians from the town, the television said. Several Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> residents welcomed the arson attack. `` So what if an Arab burned to death?'' <PERSON> Shuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Calif </PERSON>, 16, told the Hadashot newspaper. `` What's an Arab anyway. He is n't human.'' In his visit to <LOCATION> Qarara </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bukovza </PERSON> defended city residents, saying: `` Those who are under suspicion are Or Yehuda residents, but we can say with a clear conscience that our boys were not involved in this.'' He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Bukovza </PERSON> was accompanied by a dozen city residents during the trip. The delegation's bus was guarded by two army jeeps and followed by about two dozen journalists. When the group arrived at the four-story home of the <PERSON> Abadlah </PERSON> family, mayhem broke loose as camera crews and photographers pushed for positions, leaving the relatives bewildered and intimidated. The meeting was awkward at first. The victim's three brothers were seated in chairs, and <PERSON> Bukovza </PERSON> delivered his statement standing in front of them, until a village leader pointed out that it would be more appropriate for him to be seated as well. One of the brothers, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Razik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abadlah </PERSON>, said after the meeting: `` I'm very thankful that this important man came to see us. I'm very happy that he apologized to us.'' However, <PERSON> Abadlah </PERSON> said he would no longer work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because `` if I go, I will get killed.'' He said he has worked as a construction worker in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> area for 10 years. The family demanded a thorough investigation, better protection for Arab workers and compensation from Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bukovza </PERSON>, speaking in Hebrew and halting Arabic, invited the family to Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> at the end of the 40-day period of mourning and promised compensation. When asked for immediate assistance, <PERSON> Bukovza </PERSON> said he and others would pay `` a symbolic sum'' until a deal was worked out. Initially the mayor, whose parents were born in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, also planned to pay condolences to the families of the other two victims. It was not clear why they did not attend the meeting. The Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> arson was one in a recent series of violent confrontations between Arabs and Jews inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>3,000 Residents Evacuated After Fire In PCB Depot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three thousand people driven from their homes by a fire at a <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> depot in suburban <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> waited with friends and relatives late Wednesday while scientists conducted water and soil tests for contamination. Many evacuated residents complained they were being kept in the dark about the possible dangers of inhaling PCBs, a liquid chemical suspected of causing cancer. `` I'm not afraid for me but for my baby,'' said <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON> <PERSON> Labarre </PERSON>, 24, eight months pregnant. `` We all have questions and wonder what the danger is.'' Another resident, <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinesch </PERSON>, said: `` The firemen were told to burn their clothes. What about us?'' Environment Minister <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> MacMillan </PERSON> promised a thorough investigation into the cause of the six-hour inferno in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basile-le-Grand </LOCATION>, 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. The blaze sent flames more than 150 feet into the night sky on Tuesday and covered the area with a thick black cloud. More than 50 residents were treated for skin and lung irritation at local hospitals, <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavoie </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Police sealed off the area as federal and provincial scientists conducted soil and water tests. Doctors checked residents of a 5 -LCB- - square-mile area Production of PCBs -LRB- polychlorinated biphenyls -RRB- now is banned, but it was formerly used as a coolant in hydroelectric transformers. PCBs inhibit electrical flow and wo n't burn at temperatures under 1,832 degrees. The depot stored drums containing thousands of gallons of discarded oil with PCBs. Environment official <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Flammand </PERSON> said some test results may not be available for weeks. Until then, it is impossible to predict the long-term effects of inhaling the fumes. `` There's a possibility that animals -LRB- near the scene -RRB- and firemen who were exposed may suffer long-term effects,'' said <PERSON> Flammand </PERSON>. Residents in <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Basile </PERSON> and neighboring sections of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> were advised not to eat fruit or vegetables from their gardens, or drink tap water. In nearby Ste-Julie, people were warned to keep windows closed, and keep children and pets inside. The privately owned warehouse, roughly the size of a hockey rink with steel outer walls and a cement floor, has been a topic of controversy, with residents pressing for better safety. The <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> government found seven safety violations two years ago but improvements reportedly remained to be carried out. `` It's a scandal that it's still there,'' said resident <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Archambault </PERSON>. `` It takes a disaster like this before people wake up.'' The only plant in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> capable of destroying PCBs is in <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, but does not accept <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> waste from other provinces. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Basile </PERSON> is one of 50 storage sites in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> alone. `` It was a bomb waiting to go off,'' said resident <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> can station 39 more attack helicopters in central Hesse state, despite objections by local officials that the skies are already too crowded. Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> found no grounds for refusing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to base the helicopters at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air field near <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> in September, the ministry said in a statement. Earlier this month, the Hesse state parliament told the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> it objected to more helicopters being based near <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, saying air traffic was overcrowded near <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s international airport <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> is 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said that after careful study <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> decided the advantages of the helicopters in boosting the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s security and defense of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> outweighed objections to the stationing. But the statement said the decision was limited to the basing only of the 39 additional attack helicopters and does not include the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's plans to expand to 181 total aircraft at the air base by 1993. There are currently 57 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military helicopters based at the <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> site. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> released a statement late Wednesday which said the ministry's decision `` confirmed the planned stationing is within the scope of international agreements governing the use of <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> air base by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. forces.''

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court judge rejected the proposed <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> reorganization plan Wednesday, saying it did not take into account the television ministry's poor financial health. `` This plan does not work,'' Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` It does not reflect the situation.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> gave bankruptcy Trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> until Oct. 1 to prepare a new plan, and until Sept. 10 to return with information on potential buyers for the ministry's assets. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> considered but rejected the idea of closing operations down, saying that would kill <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s source of revenues, which include donations from television viewers and proceeds from the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> retreat near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>. The ministry, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in June 1987 after the resignation of founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in a sex-and-money scandal, has been divided into the newly named <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> and a corporation holding <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets. The rejected reorganization plan would have given the trustee up to five years to sell assets and repay <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s debts, which could be more than $ 130 million. After the 75-minute hearing, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he would propose to sell the assets over a shorter period of six to seven months to satisfy <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors and the court. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> did not say whether the rejection of the reorganization plan would affect a proposal by <ORGANIZATION> Samoth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owned by Canadian businessman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, to buy <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s satellite television network, the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> property and 1,700 acres of undeveloped property. <ORGANIZATION> Samoth </ORGANIZATION> has offered $ 113 million, but the money would be paid over several years. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said solidifying a sale within the next six to seven months would let creditors know exactly how much they would receive much sooner than the five years allowed in the rejected reorganization plan. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he expected to have a firm offer from <LOCATION> Samoth </LOCATION> by Sept. 1, and possibly competing offers from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, businessman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinn </PERSON>, who owns an <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION> expansion franchise in that city, and an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> group he declined to name. Both <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said any potential buyer would need to maintain a ministry on the property to support operations. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> also agreed to transfer $ 885,000 in proceeds from other assets sales to the corporation holding the ministry's assets. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said the corporation has been losing $ 400,000 a month. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> did not act on a request for funds for <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said was already some $ 400,000 in debt. Afterwards, <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> Pastor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> blamed the shortfall on legal expenses and the ministry's television program having to go through a name change. He said he would once again appeal to ministry supporters for help and should know by the end of September the ministry's future. `` If they respond we'll have a ministry. If they do n't it will be shut down,'' he said.

 Premier <PERSON> Noburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> comes to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Thursday on a six-day visit to point up recent improvements in Chinese-Japanese ties and offer new financial aid to reaffirm <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s role in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s future. It is the 64-year-old Japanese leader's first visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since taking office last November. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> will welcome <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> in a ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People.

His visit comes at a relatively trouble-free moment in the often-stormy relations between the two <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> neighbors. Officials from both sides agree the talks will be upbeat. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the visit `` will be a major event of far-reaching significance in the political life of the Chinese and Japanese people.'' On Wednesday the national television evening news, in a rare profile of a visiting dignitary, gave a lengthy account of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s life. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is to highlight the visit by announcing a new package of low-interest loans, estimated at $ 6 billion for Chinese development projects in the 1990-95 period. He is also to sign an investment protection accord reached after seven years of sometimes acrimonious negotiations that will give Japanese investors the same tax and other benefits accorded to Chinese enterprises.

<TEXT>
 The death of more than 7,000 seals in the heavily polluted <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> indicates major problems in all the world's oceans and is a warning to humans living around them, British scientists said Wednesday No link has been established between pollution and the virus leading to the severe pneumonia that is killing the seals, but dumped chemicals may be destroying their immune system so they can not fight disease, said scientists of the British government's <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> `` Whatever is causing the problem in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> could spread to affect all the world's oceans,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Proudman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> monitoring the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` Pollution is higher in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> than in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, but the two seas are connected and the state of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> is an early indicator of the state of all the oceans,'' he told a news conference. `` Seals are prone to infection, but we have seen nothing like this before,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>, head of the government-funded <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. `` We feel powerless as there is almost nothing we can do to stop the seals dying,'' he said. The British government announced it would fund new research to discover how and where seals pick up harmful pollutants in the sea. Junior Environment Minister <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottomley </PERSON> said the government was concerned about the death of seals because disease could reach <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from the eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The research involves taking samples of blood and tissue from seals and fitting some of the animals with radio transmitters so ships can track their feeding movements. A report should be ready within six months, Mrs. <PERSON> Bottomley </PERSON> said. The scientists said a group of highly toxic compounds called PCBs _ polychlorinated biphenols _ used in electrical equipment like transformers are among the prime suspect chemicals. `` Seals represent the highest mammals in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and are the closest to man physiologically, so when they die in thousands it is a warning to man,'' <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON> said half the population of common seals in <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has died from the virus on the coasts of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 200,000 gray seals might be threatened. These seals account for half the world population of gray seals and still are not known to be affected by the virus. Only 500 to 1,000 monk seals survive in the eastern <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> Sea of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and the west African coast of <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>. These seals `` could be in terrible danger if the disease spreads,'' and the disease could also spread to dolphins and porpoises, he said. <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON> said Dutch scientists isolated two viruses in dead seals, one a type of herpes and the other a type of picorna, which causes polio and hoof and mouth disease in livestock. Dr. <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON>, an independent marine biologist of <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We know nothing of immunity in seals or fish, only in man. We are in a very weak position when something like this happens. It's as if you had to start studying medicine for human beings all over again.'' Sir <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Body </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker, called for urgent government action to stop <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> pollution because <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was `` pouring more filth'' into it than any other nation. <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunkett </PERSON> said, `` It is time for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to act, to prevent the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> becoming the <LOCATION> Dead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and to work with the Dutch and the Scandinavians in saving what seals we can.''

<HEAD>Conference Adopts Plan of Action For African Refugee Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> adopted a plan Wednesday to help ease the plight of 5.4 million refugees in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It asked for intensified world aid. The Oslo Declaration and Plan of Action said relief efforts should concentrate on rebuilding agriculture, finding jobs for displaced people and providing them access to credit and marketing structures. The three-day conference attracted more than 400 delegates from 80 countries, specialized <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies and African `` liberation movements.'' The plan suggested a general outline for helping refugees in nine states bordering or near <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. It said greater efforts should be made to forecast and prepare for emergencies; to assess relief needs and plan deliveries; to help affected areas recover and develop, and to step up the mobilization of resources. `` The conference recognizes that the conditions of refugees, returnees and displaced persons is a global responsibility,'' the declaration said, stressing the need for international burden-sharing. Documents distributed at the conference estimated some of the annual recovery costs for southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as: $ 150 million for agriculture, $ 100 million for health and education, $ 50 million for housing, $ 50 million for roads, $ 40 million for emergency food stocks, $ 25 million for water supplies, $ 20 million to deal with soil erosion and $ 15 million for sanitation. The conference recommended more coordination among existing organizations, particularly the High Commissioner for Refugees, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The document blamed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial policy for many of the problems in the area, although millions of the refugees also were displaced inside their own countries by domestic conflicts. `` The root causes of the tragic humanitarian crisis unfolding in the region is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid policy, its illegal occupation of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, the policies it pursues in the region of direct and indirect acts of aggression, intimidation and destabilization,'' the declaration said. `` The fundamental and lasting solutions to the region's refugee problem lie in the adoption of political and other actions aimed at bringing about total abolition of apartheid, racial equality, national independence and improved economic and social conditions.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> attended the conference opening on Monday before leaving for <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Also attending were <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> chairman and <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Traore </PERSON>; President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>; Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Hocke </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees. The conference asked that its declaration be submitted to the next <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sessions for appraisal and follow-up. By law and custom, apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 A prominent Jewish leader said Wednesday he's `` disappointed and saddened'' at the response of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to his request for a statement condemning anti-Semitic remarks made about the film `` The Last Temptation of Christ.'' <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON>, national director of the New York-based Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, chastised the former Republican presidential hopeful for failing to quickly condemn statements made by some critics of the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> film, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON>, in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said he was sad the personal correspondence between him and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had become public in the newspaper and that he considered <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to be a friend. But he repeated his contention that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s initial response to his letter asking the television evangelist for a condemnation of anti-Semitism had been inadequate. `` I appreciated his advice,'' <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. `` And I respect his judgment. `` But I am still disappointed and saddened. This is something that needs no great strategy or counsel. We should be able to stand up and say, ` Anti-Semitism is wrong.''' Some conservative Christians, unhappy with the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> film, claimed it is a Jewish attack on Christianity. <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, is Jewish. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> criticized the film but did not join in the attacks on <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>. In a statement Wednesday, he said he did eventually condemn the anti-Jewish comments about the film on his television show, `` The 700 Club In his first letter to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON> asked the evangelist to condemn anti-Semitic rhetoric. In his response, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he would condemn any anti-Semitism `` that might occur,'' and suggested the <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION> join him in criticizing the picture. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, founder and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement Wednesday saying he too was upset that private correspondence had been made public, and expressed disappointment that the <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION> leader had not taken his advice to condemn the film. `` I was advising a dear, personal friend of what I felt was the most effective strategy in this particular situation _ to stop anti-Semitic rhetoric and sentiment about this film before it ever began,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` Had they done what I suggested, it would have been a great move to solidify the rapport between Christians and Jews in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and further prompt unity between us.'' <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON> said he believed that whether the <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION> took a stand on the film or not, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> should speak out on the anti-Semitism. `` I have seen the film, and I can understand why Christians are upset. I think that the discussion of the portrayal of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in the film is certainly proper within the Christian community. `` But at the same time, the anti-Semitism is something we have been fighting for 2,000 years. If we let these things stand unchallenged, they become the accepted truth. It is time that those in the middle stand up and be heard, rather than only those on both extremes,'' <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON> said. In his statement, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said: `` I will always stand against anti-Semitism. I have already spoken out on ` The 700 Club' on this matter as I promised.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abourjilie </PERSON> said she had no details on what <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had said or when he said it.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded up to 15 Palestinians on Wednesday and their government rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism of its policy of deporting activists from the occupied territories. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, in the first such warning, that relations would be damaged if the Israelis continued deporting Palestinians from the occupied lands. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> delivered the warning Monday at a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> diplomat. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, troops fired on Palestinians who hurled stones and burned tires in the alleys of the central market, the army said. As soldiers and Palestinians skirmished, scores of kites flown by children on rooftops darted in the sky. One box kite sailing near the casbah, or old city, wore the red, white, black and green colors of the outlawed Palestinian flag. A spokesman said two Palestinians were wounded by gunfire, two by rubber bullets and two by plastic bullets. Arab hospital officials put the number hit by gunfire at 11, including a 17-year-old girl seriously wounded in the chest. Four Palestinians were wounded at the <LOCATION> Shati </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the army spokesman said. Arab hospital officials said an 8-year-old boy was shot in the back. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said a 10-year-old Israeli boy on his way to the Jewish settlement of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION> was struck in the head by a rock as his bus passed the El Arrub refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. Palestinians began a two-day general strike Wednesday in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to protest the deaths of four Arabs held in Israeli prisons. The mayor of an Israeli town where arsonists killed three Palestinians drove to the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to apologize to the family of one victim. At least 252 Arabs have been killed in the uprising that began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians who live in the occupied lands, most of them shot by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Four Israelis also have been slain. Soldiers with bulldozers demolished three homes before dawn Wednesday in Jelazoun refugee camp. The houses belonged to members of outlawed local committees who were suspected in the beating death of a Palestinian youth who allegedly collaborated with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the army said. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> counted more than 20 instances of soldiers opening fire _ most often into the air as warnings or with rubber or plastic bullets, which are lethal only at close range. At least twice while the reporter was present, soldiers radioed commanding officers for permission to fire live ammunition. Maj. <PERSON> Elkana </PERSON>, whose full name can not be disclosed because of army regulations, turned down a soldier who asked permission to fire a .22 caliber rifle at the legs of protesters blocking a main road. Mayor <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukovza </PERSON> of Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON>, near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, told relatives of arson victim <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Abadlah </PERSON>: `` What happened really shocked me. It's a commandment to bring the spirit of peace, and express our will to live together.'' <PERSON> Abadlah </PERSON> was sleeping a construction site shack in Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> when he was burned to death. His three brothers listened with tears in their eyes and accepted <PERSON> Bukovza </PERSON>'s apology, but demanded harsh punishment for the arsonists and better protection for Palestinian workers in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Foreign Ministry, in a reply to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism, said Wednesday: `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> does not accept the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interpretation of international law regarding deportations. The legality ... was checked recently by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled that deportations are legal, according to both Israeli and international law.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> spent 90 minutes with Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> discussing the issue. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television later reported that both <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> the deportation policy would continue. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s inner Cabinet of 10 senior ministers met Wednesday and endorsed the policy, the television said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s criticism `` has created a small crisis, certainly tension in the relationship,'' said <PERSON> Eytan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilboa </PERSON>, a specialist on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The language was exceptionally strong.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported 33 Palestinians since the rebellion began, contending they are leaders of resistance to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule, and has ordered the expulsions of 25 more. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers expulsions a violation of human rights and an obstacle to peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said Wednesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` shocked'' by the decision to deport another 25 Palestinians. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has long-standing differences with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on deportation, detention without trial and other punitive measures against Palestinians, but never had indicated they threatened relations.

 The right-wing government on Wednesday decreed an end to all state of emergency measures for the first time since President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> took power in a 1973 coup, the interior minister announced. The action was taken less than a week before <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military commanders meet to nominate a candidate, expected to be <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself, for a presidential referendum planned for October. Interior Minister <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, in a news conference at the government palace, told reporters that presidential decrees removing the emergency measures `` have been issued today and will take effect upon publication in the official bulletin,'' within the next few days. The two measures now in effect are a state of emergency and a state of disturbance to internal peace. Under the state of emergency, the government is authorized to suspend publication and broadcasts by news media and restrict public gatherings. The state of disturbance measure permits <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to order the arrest and detention of opponents for up to 20 days; send into exile citizens deemed dangerous to internal security; order internal exile for up to three months, and restrict freedom of information and public gatherings. Opposition figures reacted with cautious approval. `` Better late than never,'' said <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hales </PERSON>, head of the national lawyers' association and a prominent critic of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. `` I now hope the government will not resort to any legal loopholes to prevent Chileans from exercising rights of which they have been deprived for 15 years,'' <PERSON> Hales </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustos </PERSON>, leader of the main labor conferation, called the government's action positive `` because it creates better conditions for a clean referendum.'' The president of the country's <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, Monsignor <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, lauded the government action. `` It makes me profoundly happy,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said in remarks broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperativo </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. `` I think this will contribute to the peace of everyone, it gives tranquility, it gives confidence.'' Since Sept. 11, 1973, when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> led a coup that toppled the government of elected Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> always has been under a state of siege, of emergency or of disturbance of internal peace. Each has been lifted at one time or another, but never before have all been lifted and often more than one has been in effect at the same time. According to <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, the new decrees were issued because authorities had established order within the country. `` The efforts of the competent -LRB- government -RRB- agencies to guarantee public calm and order have born fruit,'' he said. `` Neither the cunning aggression of extremists nor the violence that certain groups persistently utilize has managed to compromise the general atmosphere of order, peace and progress.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, several foreign governments including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the political opposition and even many government supporters had called for lifting the states of emergency before the referendum. They said the ballot would lack credibility if civil liberties were restricted during the political campaign. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, navy commander <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, air force chief <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON> and national police director <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stange </PERSON> meet Aug. 30 to pick the presidential nominee and announce a date for the referendum. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is virtually assured of the nomination. Although the precise date of the ballot has not been announced, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has said it will take place in early October. If the candidate wins a majority in the vote, he will begin an eight-year term in March. If a majority rejects him, open elections will be held in 1990, with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining in place until then. According to lawyer <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> of the local <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church's human rights agency, the lifting of the states of emergency could allow most of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 504 political exiles to return. The law allows for some exiles to remain barred from returning, he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an telephone interview.

 Police converged on strikebound coal mines and a port, activists said Thursday, after more workers joined stoppages and Solidarity denounced official repression of the protests. The government and workers are struggling for the initiative in the biggest labor upheaval since Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> imposed martial law in December 1981 to crush and then outlaw Solidarity, the first independent labor union in the Soviet bloc. Strikers demand higher pay, better working conditions and that Solidarity be made legal again. `` We condemn and strongly protest these acts,'' <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a senior Solidarity adviser, said Wednesday of police strike-breaking actions. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> was asked by telephone whether the government was getting the upper hand and replied: `` There is more and more news about strikes ended, but on the other hand there are new centers of workers' conflicts still appearing.'' Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> declared to young strikers: `` It is you, the young people, who will renew Solidarity and renew the country.'' Strikes began Aug. 16 and have spread to more than 20 sites. A Soviet spokesman said Wednesday his government was watching the Polish strike situation with concern, but the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> has not made an official statement. In <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where the Soviet army crushed an uprising in 1956, more than 300 miners struck Wednesday against bonus cuts and a new income tax. It was the first known worker protest of stringent economic policies introduced by <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who became <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in May. In northwest <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, helicopters circled over the strikebound <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> port early Thursday, and police massed outside its barricaded gate, said Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemczyk </PERSON>. Police invaded a bus depot in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> early Wednesday, and 150 strikers who had been holed up there for a week yielded quietly. A strike at the Mieszko coal mine in <LOCATION> Walbrzych </LOCATION> ended Tuesday night in similar fashion when police broke down the barricaded gate. <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, another senior Solidarity adviser, said: `` The situation in <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> has become extremely serious.'' He said workers at other coal mines in southwestern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> may follow the example of those at the 30 Years of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> mine, who have barricaded themselves in more than 1,500 feet below the surface. `` Other miners are preparing to evacuate -LRB- to -RRB- underground if there are signs of intervention,'' <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> said. Polish strikers occupy their job sites instead of walking out, as do workers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said strikes ended peacefully at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Borynia </LOCATION> mines, all in the <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> region of southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Niemczyk </PERSON> said the `` voluntary'' evacuation at <LOCATION> Borynia </LOCATION> occurred only after riot police threatened a raid. Late Wednesday, large convoys of police vehicles headed toward strikebound coal mines in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said an activist in <LOCATION> Jastrezebie </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lycyna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wujec </PERSON>. Up to 60 vehicles were seen going toward the July Manifesto mine in <LOCATION> Jastrezebie </LOCATION>, where the strikes began last week, Ms. <PERSON> Wujec </PERSON> said. The convoy consisted of police vans, armored personnel carriers, water cannons and ambulances, said Ms. <PERSON> Wujec </PERSON>. She said about 12 other police vans headed to the <LOCATION> Morcinek </LOCATION> mine. Witnesses said earlier about 30 police vehicles had moved in around the July Manifesto mine. An army helicopter hovered and a convoy of 103 police vehicles, including water cannon, jeeps, trucks and an armored personnel carrier, moved through the town, according to reporters at the scene. Foreign journalists were barred from the mine area for the first time since Aug. 16. About 1,000 employees quit working Wednesday in two departments at the <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> steel mill, where a strike attempt fizzled after a few hours Monday, said <PERSON> Maciej </PERSON> <PERSON> Mach </PERSON>, a worker leader who spoke from the plant by telephone. <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION>, which has 30,000 employees, was the scene of a major strike during the last labor unrest in May, but a police raid ended it. Solidarity activists said strikes spread on Wednesday to the <LOCATION> Knurow </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> and the Dzialoszyn cement works in central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but the government did not confirm the reports. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said eight mines remained on strike and Solidarity spokesmen reported 10. The latest <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> strike brought all major dock and shipyard industries to a halt in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port. Employees of the Lenin shipyard, where <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> works as an electrician, went on strike Monday in support of the miners and of port and transport workers in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. Workers at the other port and shipyard facilities in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> quickly followed, paralyzing the nation's vital export industries. Tons of high-grade export coal remain in rail cars at the bulk-loading terminal, which has also been idle since Monday. Riot troops have sealed off all strikebound operations in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> led rallies at three shipyards Wednesday. Some of his comments were on a tape provided to reporters. Hundreds of workers, including some on the deck of a Soviet ship undergoing repair, listened as he blamed government leaders for bringing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to economic ruin. In an effort to quell public unrest, the government has said a special session of a parliament commission will review economic policy later this month.

<TEXT>
 A war between two Colombian gangs to control <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s cocaine market is out of control, the mayor of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> said in a report published Wednesday. The commander of the national police in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, Col. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, asked the federal government on Wednesday to use state of emergency and state of siege measures to combat the violence. On Tuesday, Mayor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> told a news conference, `` The only thing we can do is increase the size of the police force.'' <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said it is impossible for <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> to control the mob war _ `` National or international help is needed.'' Colombian newspapers reported the news conference in Wednesday's editions One gang has headquarters in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s second largest city, and the other in <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, the third largest city. The two cartels have been at war for six months for supremacy of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> cocaine market, estimated by Colombian authorities to be worth $ 35 billion a year. Eighty gang members have been killed, 62 of them belonging to the Cali mob. The entire nation has been under a state of siege for all but a few months of the last 35 years. A state of siege was imposed anew four years ago when drug traffickers assassinated Justice Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> in the capital city of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s largest city with 6 million people President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> could use the state of siege to give search and seizure authority to the army and other government security forces without requiring them to act on a judge's orders. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> also could impose curfews and restrict the right of public assembly. Last year he issued a decree allowing the army to arrest and try civilians in an effort to combat drug trafficking, but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck the decree down as unconstitutional.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have agreed in principle to extend for one year the current deal between the two countries for Soviet purchase of American grain, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Wednesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the terms were `` essentially identical'' to current arrangements, under which the Soviets must buy at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain annually. The five-year pact expires Sept. 30. The official said the two sides reached a mutual decision to try to devise a new accord but to stick to the terms now in force. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the deal was sealed last week through `` diplomatic channels.'' A second official said he hoped a pact between the two countries could be reached at the next negotiating session, but said that no final agreement has been reached. `` We feel like we made some progress, but we're still far apart on pricing, minimums and things of that nature,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The grain deal benefits American farmers, now experiencing severe drought problems, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which often looks to the West for grain even though it has had a good harvest this year. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated that the Soviets would have a bumper harvest of 215 million metric tons, which would be their third best crop ever. The Soviets are importing grain to build up their stockpiles and to feed expanding livestock herds. The Soviets have already been given permission to purchase more than 12 million tons of grain for this year. As of last month, they had bought more than 5 million tons of corn, more than 9 million tons of wheat, 830,700 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

 Residents of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s boyhood hometown say a friendly welcome is all the pomp and circumstance they'll need for a weeklong `` <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'' goodwill visit by a delegation from <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. `` It will be a very laid back and relaxed visit,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> City Clerk <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Graff </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` They're coming here in the spirit of harmony as a sister city. They will see how we live and exist here. We will show them the American side of life.'' The Soviet delegation _ <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kardamyshev </PERSON>, journalist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> and interpreter <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vishnewvsky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ arrived in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for the first leg of their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journey. They planned to continue on about 100 miles west to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> later Wednesday night. Mayor <PERSON> Kardamyshev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> shook hands warmly after the visitors got off the plane. <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> noted that the delegation had to wait in line for two hours in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before getting their passports and visas checked, and missed an earlier flight to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It's beautiful here, but your bureaucracy is much worse than ours,'' <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> said. But he said he was looking forward to the visit because, `` I want to learn more about the interesting people and places here.'' In <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> the group will be greeted by storefront signs proclaiming `` Peace on Earth'' in English and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION>, and flags of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Rather than glitz, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> officials hope to impress the Soviets with a scenic <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> setting, seven miles of petunia-lined streets, and friendly, hard-working, peace-loving residents. `` I want them to feel they are experiencing Midwestern American hospitality,'' said <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. `` I want them to see our people at work. To see what we produce. Hopefully, they will get a feel for life in small-town <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The visitors will view this town of 15,700 from a boat excursion on the <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, in tours of factories and farms and in meals at the local restaurants. `` We're going to take them to Pizza Hut and places like <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s Garden Deli for sandwiches, stuffed baked potatos and frozen yogurt,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said But mainly, they will get a heavy dose of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> history. The first thing on their agenda Thursday is a private tour of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s boyhood home, a two-story frame house on the city's south side. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> `` Dutch'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, son of a shoe salesman and a dress maker, lived there from 1920 until he left for college in 1928. Born in nearby <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> moved to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> with his family when he was 9; it was here he began to show an interest in drama, politics and athletics.

 <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> went to court Wednesday to fight a possible jail sentence for failing to turn over financial records and luxury items allegedly purchased with donations for her late son's liver transplants. At the opening of an often-acrimonious contempt hearing, the attorney for the court-appointed curator of <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' estate said Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' fate was in her own hands `` We are here with a sincere sense of regret,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dribin </PERSON>. `` The curator-trustee has no desire to see Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> punished ... the key to the jailhouse cell is held by Ms. DeSillers.'' As <PERSON> Dribin </PERSON> spoke, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> muttered `` What a joke.'' Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, said he would show his client had already complied with the court's demands. Dade Circuit Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> has repeatedly ordered Ms. DeSillers to surrender a BMW car, jewelry, clothes and other items believed bought with about $ 200,000 of the almost $ 700,000 donated to pay for operations on <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>. So far, however, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has turned in only the car. Her attorneys have complained that the order is unclear and includes items she bought with with her own money. The contempt hearing was scheduled to continue Thursday. The judge could rule immediately on whether to jail or fine Ms. DeSillers, or take the decision under advisement. When curator <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> took the witness stand, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> repeatedly attacked her testimony. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> admonished Black several times to stop interrupting Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>, who testified she had never received documents that would enable her to determine whether some of Ms. DeSillers' expenditures were legitimate. Black grilled Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> on whether she knew the intentions of all the donors _ who include President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ and on whether the money was given in <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s name or his mother's. `` To this day I have n't gotten any of the information,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> responded. `` I was trying to find out what the assets were.'' Black also criticized the curator for hiring expensive attorneys without negotiating a fee first, but she said she would not have had to pay anything if Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> had obeyed the court orders. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> also brushed aside <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s contention that by turning over the financial records, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> was being forced to testify against herself. `` Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> can not hide behind the Fifth Amendment and flout the courts,'' said the curator. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> then called to the stand <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON>, whose son was a classmate of <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> threw herself into building a foundation for other transplant children after her son died. `` It was disorganized, perhaps misguided _ I think it was her way of handling grief,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON>. `` Something needs to be done for these children but it's not <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>.'' She said the effort was sincere, however. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, 7, died at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in April 1987 after undergoing three unsuccessful liver transplants. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has refused to pay $ 262,000 to the hospital, claiming that her son received improper care. His case was widely publicized after more than $ 4,000 gathered for him by schoolmates was stolen from a classroom closet, and donations began pouring in from around the world.

<TEXT>
 Government officials on Wednesday said flood-damaged roads and railways were slowing relief to the north and complained that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were providing little help, news media reported. The governor of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s northern region, <PERSON> Abdul-Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Amin </PERSON>, said the situation after flooding in his area was `` disastrous.'' He said `` relief and food supplies are non-existent.'' In statements made to the daily <ORGANIZATION> al-Siyassa </ORGANIZATION>, he blamed the shortage on disrupted transportation and said rail tracks had been damaged by the floods. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> also said about one million people in the northern provinces were in urgent need of relief supplies. Torrential rains Aug. 4-5 in the northern provinces and around the capital <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> left 1.5 million people homeless. The government declared five disaster areas at the start of the floods, including <LOCATION> Dongola </LOCATION>, 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, and el-Damer, 160 miles north east of the capital. On Tuesday, the waters of the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION> overflowed in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Omdurman </LOCATION> across the Nile from the capital, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The confluence of the Blue and <PERSON> White </PERSON> <PERSON> Niles </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> form the Nile river that runs on through <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to enter the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>. International relief supplies were flown in, but Sudanese officials repeatedly have said they only met 10 percent of the actual needs. At a tea reception for foreign reporters Wednesday, <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, minister for Culture and Information, attacked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for `` not supplying <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> with anyhing worth mentioning.'' He said 90 percent of relief material received so far came from Arab countries, or 4,390 tons of the total 4,775 tons. In statements carried by the news agency <ORGANIZATION> MENA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said 13 <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states had come to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s rescue. `` What we need now is not food or blankets, but medicine and agricultural material,'' he said. `` It is not important now to send food, but to help us produce it.'' Earlier Wednesday, Sudanese authorities said there was no epidemic outbreak of diseases so far, quelling fears of fatal diseases resulting from a scarcity of clean drinking water following recent floods. Health officials said 19 cases of suspected cholera in and around the capital proved to be only a mild form of diarrhea. Cholera and acute diarrhea kills the young and the weak. A lack of fresh water supplies makes even basic treatment difficult. Officials said cases of malaria, another gastro-intestinal infection, are on the rise, as are respiratory tract infections and eye diseases. The reports were carried by the daily <ORGANIZATION> al-Ayam </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, quoting unidentified health officials. Wednesday's reports seemed to contradict earlier statements from the Sudanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION>, a relief organization, which last week said more than 5,000 people were suffering from severe diarrhea, most of them children. Officials reportedly had identified some cases as malaria, cholera and typhoid. Following the floods, health officials predicted deadly epidemics of water-borne diseases as people cut off from drinking warter supplies are forced to drink from contaminated pools left behind by the rainstorms and floods. In his meeting with foreign reporters, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> defended the government's decision to impose press censorship, saying these were `` ordinary measures used in democratic countries in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... to preserve the security and reputation of the country.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> ordered foreign journalists and photographers to conduct interviews and take pictures only in the presence of an information ministry representative. He said news stories and films must be cleared before being allowed out of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> a day earlier criticized foreign media for allegedly exaggerating the disastrous effects of flooding in the capital and elsewhere, which has been called the worst in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s history.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that Nicaraguan rebels killed three civilians, kidnapped 10 people and wounded two others in separate attacks in recent days. A Ministry statement also said 15 of the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, were killed in `` combat actions in response to attacks by the counter-revolutionaries on our troops.'' The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government and rebels agreed to a truce in March, but the two sides failed to reach a permanent settlement in the 7-year-old civil war. Negotiations broke off June 9, and each side has charged the other with violating the truce.

The statement did not say if any of the casualties included government troops.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ended a three-day fast protesting the use of pesticides on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grapes Wednesday, and another leading civil rights figure picked up the fast `` in the name of justice, equity and peace.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, stood outside a food store and urged consumers to boycott <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grapes. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had been on a water-only diet since Sunday when he attended Mass with <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, as the union leader ended a 36-day fast in <LOCATION> Delano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

 Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> assembly Wednesday, `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> does n't run away from a fight,'' as he sought during his first solo campaign trip to set aside questions about his military record during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> era. In an impassioned defense of his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> duty during the war, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator told a cheering audience of 1,000 present and former <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> members that `` I'm not looking for any medals'' but `` I served loyally.'' `` Nearly 20 years ago, I had no reason to be ashamed of my service. And you know what, I'm sure as hell not ashamed of it now!'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> noted that Missourian <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> also served in the Guard, and said, `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> never ran away from a fight, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> never runs away either, and by the way, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> does n't run away from a fight.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he `` was n't looking for favors'' when he entered the Guard in 1969 and reiterated that `` no rules were broken'' and no effort had been made to `` influence the process'' of his admission during the height of the Vietnam War. `` I'm not looking for any medals. And I'm not asking for a pat on the back. But let me say this: I served. I served loyally, and I served to the best of my ability,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator began this campaign swing seeking to shift attention from the controversy and focus instead on his message of peace, freedom and jobs. Almost at the very start, he had a good-natured airport encounter with his Democratic counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who had just warned Southern state legislators not to `` risk youthful indiscretion'' in someone like <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> who might someday ascend to the presidency. In the speech, he criticized Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for an `` anti-defense attitude.'' `` One of the worst false impressions <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has put forward is the idea that he stands for a strong national defense,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` Maybe he sincerely believes that. But he stands for the opposite, and that position has been clouded over by the distractions of the last few days.'' `` I suppose <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is enjoying this firestorm because it's helping distract people from the issues of this campaign,'' he said. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll released Wednesday yielded some encouraging results for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Sixty-four percent of the respondents said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military record should not be an issue in the campaign, while 27 percent said it should. Also, 42 percent of registered voters approved of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee; 27 percent disapproved and 30 percent were not sure. The poll was conducted Saturday through Monday among 1,762 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus three points. During the day, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> kept out of range of reporters and sought to concentrate on campaign issues and the prospective virtues of a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. An aide said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> wanted to focus on `` things we want to talk about.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ignored reporters' shouted questions seeking a response to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s remarks. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had tried to exploit <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s earlier comment that his `` youthful indiscretion'' was to blame for his vote against elevating the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to a Cabinet-level department. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, told reporters later that if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic candidate, were elected president, the country would be plunged into a `` midlife crisis because he knows very little about defense issues.'' In appearances before Midwestern state legislators in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and a Southern legislative conference in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> avoided any discussion of his military record or allegations about his past association with former lobbyist <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, the scion of a wealthy <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> publishing family, has denied that strings were pulled to get him into the Guard during the Vietnam War or to gain his admission to <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> after a mediocre performance in college. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, was quoted Wednesday in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> as saying his son had majored in `` booze and broads.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s spokesman refused comment. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has also denied having a sexual affair with <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, who shared a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacation house with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and several other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members in 1980. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> termed `` outrageous'' a Parkinson assertion that he had propositioned her. In his speeches before state lawmakers Wednesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was proud of a jobs training bill he had co-sponsored in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1980s. He said the legislation had resulted in training 3.4 million economically disadvantaged people, `` and there will be millions more.'' `` These are n't make-work, makeshift type of jobs. These are real jobs,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He said he supported reforms of the federal budget process, which is now carried out annually through budget resolutions and appropriations and authorization bills. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a three-layer cake out there, and one of them is going to have to go,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He said the budget should be drafted every two years, instead of one, and that the president should be authority to veto individual budget items rather than entire bills. `` I believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could stand a little bit of perestroika, to coin a phrase,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, referring to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of economic restructuring.

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A radio station manager said Wednesday that his station's hiring of <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> as an on-air personality was more than a publicity stunt. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, whose sexual encounter with <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> led to the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> evangelist's downfall, has signed a 30-day contract starting Monday with station KOY-FM. `` We feel that <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> has the potential to develop into a strong radio personality,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, the station's operations manager `` That, coupled with her desire ... convinced us.'' He and Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, who appeared in a white leather miniskirt, KOY shirt and high heels, spent most of a 30-minute news conference trying to convince reporters that the station was serious about developing her into a fifth member of its morning show. The 29-year-old former church secretary did a test run on <ORGANIZATION> KOY </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Y-Morning Zoo'' show Aug. 18, and listener reaction was `` overwhelmingly positive,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> was modest about her qualifications, though. `` I'm not a professional. I know I need to learn a lot and polish up,'' she acknowledged. Nevertheless, she said she had been interested in being on radio for years and felt at home with KOY. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s contract includes promotional appearances but insisted the station, which has played elaborate pranks in its search for publicity, was not trying to raise its ratings. A public-relations firm distributed sheets from the Tapscan Rating Analysis System showing KOY-FM sixth of 20 <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> stations in listenership. The contract has a renewal option and <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said, `` We both hope to make this a long-term agreement.'' But neither he nor Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> would say definitely that she planned to be with the station by October. Nude photographs of Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> following breast-enlargement and other cosmetic surgery appear in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazine's latest issue. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> refused to discuss salary details, but <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said the contract included housing and `` very adequate'' compensation. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, another personality on the show, described Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> as `` the Vanna White of the morning show. She's going to be our prize-and-weather bunny.''

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> criticized Republican rival <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s voting record on Wednesday and said the nation ca n't risk `` youthful indiscretion'' so close to the Oval Office. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> touted his work on jobs legislation and defended his military record before a cheering National Guard audience. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> does n't run away from a fight,'' the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator told a group of 1,000 former and present Guard members in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` stands for the same principles'' as he and the vice president. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received an endorsement from the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and charged that the legacy of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was more jobs but lower family income. Meanwhile, two fresh polls indicated that the surge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received during last week's Republican National Convention already was dissipating. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> survey put the vice president's margin as 44-39, while a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> survey pegged it at 49-47. Both leads were within the margin of error, indicating the race is a dead heat. The two campaigns also sparred over the timing of campaign debates for the fall. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said it was `` inexcusable'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to decline dates of Sept. 8 and 14 established by organizations interested in staging the confrontations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` It is unlikely that a debate can occur prior to Sept. 20.'' But the political spotlight was uncharacteristically fixed on campaign understudies, particularly on the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and the controversy about his <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> era stint in the National Guard. Democrat <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told Southern legislators meeting in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had said earlier in the week that `` youthful indiscretion'' initially led him to vote against <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation granting Cabinet-level status to the Veterans Administration. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also noted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention that he had changed his mind on the subject and now favored the bill. `` A youthful indiscretion? My friends, that vote occurred only five weeks ago,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. ` I do n't think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can risk youthful indiscretion in someone who could become our president at any moment.'' At a news conference following his speech, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s reversal on the VA bill and said, `` You've got to stand up to that kind of heat.'' He also referred indirectly to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> era stint in the National Guard. `` I certainly do n't think he's too young,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said of his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleague. `` But I think you have to have some maturity.'' He added, `` And I think the breadth of experience that I've had and the tests that I've undergone, some of the things that happened to me early on, in combat, make you grow up pretty fast.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in his debut as a campaign soloist, said he had helped draft the Job Training and Partnership Act in the early 1980s, which he claimed had provided jobs for millions of workers, including women and poor people. `` This program is working. We have trained 3.4 million economically disadvantaged people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> so far, and there will be millions more,'' he said before flying on to <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. In his <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he `` was n't looking for favors'' when he entered the Guard in 1969. He said `` no rules were broken'' and no effort had been made to `` influence the process'' of his admission during the height of the Vietnam War. `` I'm not looking for any medals. And I'm not asking for a pat on the back. But let me say this: I served. I served loyally, and I served to the best of my ability,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. The NBC-Journal poll yielded some encouraging results for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Sixty-four percent said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military record should not be an issue in the campaign, while 27 percent said it should. Also, 42 percent of registered voters approved of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee; 27 percent disapproved and 30 percent were not sure. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made no mention of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as he traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to receive his endorsement from the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. In a speech to union members, he promised `` new economic patriotism'' based on strong business-labor relations. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor conceded that more Americans hold jobs than ever before, but said low-paying positions have been the legacy of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and that average family income is no greater than it was 20 years ago. `` That's the price our workers and their families are paying for voodoo economics,'' he said in a speech in a hotel a few blocks from the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the first time since winning the Republican nomination next week. He sought to deflect attention away from the controversy over his running mate, accusing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of `` looking for a reason'' to veto <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> legislation requiring teachers to lead their students in recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. `` What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so much?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he vetoed the bill after receiving an advisory opinion from the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that the measure was unconstitutional. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> heaped praise on his vice president. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a man of action _ a man accustomed to command,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a rally at the hotel where the president is staying during a break from his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranch vacation. `` The vice presidency does n't fit easily on such a man,'' he said. `` But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is also a patriot. And so he made it fit, and he served with a distinction no one has ever matched.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor intends to go ahead with plans to be in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> on Sept. 14, the date selected by a bipartisan presidential commission for a debate on national security issues. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision not to debate before Sept. 20 `` threatens the full schedule of debates anticipated for the fall.'' But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said it was `` unlikely'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could debate before Sept. 20 because the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> concluded only last week. Aides to the two candidates are expected to open face to face negotiations on debates next week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The NBC-Journal poll was conducted Saturday through Monday among 1,762 registered voters, the <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll Friday through Monday among 1,310 likely voters. Both had error margins of plus or minus three points.

 A Soviet fishing vessel collided with a Panamanian freighter in the fog Wednesday off the Canadian coast, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. There were no injuries, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON>. Coast Guard Petty Officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> said the freighter, Ocean Fame, took on water from a gash in its bow and proceeded under its own power to <LOCATION> Barkley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s southwest coast. Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials examined the freighter. <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> said the Soviet vessel, Irtyshsk, remained in the vicinity of the collision and was unloading some of its diesel fuel to another Soviet fishing boat. The collision occurred about 6:30 a.m. about 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flattery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter Clover was at the scene, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviet vessel carried a crew of 120; the 500-foot Panamanian freighter, which left <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> on Tuesday loaded with grain for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, had a crew of 18. <PERSON> Micheline </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodeur </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> said she did not have details of the Panamanian ship's damage, but added, `` Apparently there was some concern for a while that it would sink.''

The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> branch would investigate the accident, Ms. <PERSON> Brodeur </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, Senior Chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, declined to speculate on whether the Soviet vessel was gathering intelligence on Trident submarines based at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s base at <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Taking More Tolerant Tack About Religion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seasoned by some new, more conservative members, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seems to be occasionally taking a more tolerant tack about religion's place in public affairs. This was indicated in several of the court's rulings in its 1987-88 term, notably in upholding inclusion of religious organizations in a federal program to fight teen-age pregnancy and abortion. In a time of soaring church-state litigation, the case was among a dozen of this kind handled in the high court's latest term. The Family Life Act of 1981, which critics derisively call the `` chastity law,'' had been challenged as unconstitutionally advancing religion by funding religious as well as secular groups to foster sexual discipline among youths. There are nearly a million teen-age pregnancies annually in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with about half of them aborted. Under the law, about a fourth of the $ 10 million spent annually under the act has gone to religious groups. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and others charged this unconstitutionally promoted religion. However, in a 5-4 decision on the final day of the court's term June 30, it upheld the law, saying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may recognize `` the important part that ... religious organizations play in resolving certain secular problems.'' Such organizations are n't barred `` from participating in publicly sponsored social welfare programs,'' wrote Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, adding that any boost to religion was `` at most incidental.'' Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> dissented, saying `` government funds are paying for religious organization to teach and counsel impressionable adolescents on a highly senstive subject of considerable religious significance.'' In another case that turned out favorably for religious groups, the court let stand an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law exempting religious day-care centers from state regulations. About 33 states have such laws. Churches provide the largest sponsorship of day-care centers in the nation. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had upheld a state law exempting church-run centers from state regulations, rejecting a challenge to it as violating the First Amendment ban against establishing religion. The high court left the ruling in place. The state had argued that such exemptions enhanced church-state separation by avoiding state inquiries into religious beliefs as would be required if the centers were state licensed. Another case of historic potential in upholding religious rights, an 8-1 high court decision overruled a lower court decision and held the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> had a right to appeal a contempt citation against it. The contempt citation had been issued by a district court for the church's refusal to produce a vast array of internal church records demanded in a lawsuit by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> pro-abortion group. It sought to have the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> revoke the entire church's federal tax exemption on the ground that it had engaged in political activity opposing abortion. Most of the nation's other major denominations, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern Orthodox, had sided with <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in opposing the attack on its tax exemption _ seeing it as a threat to all religious bodies. Another potentially major decision came when the high court ruled that former leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> had no legal standing to appeal a lower court ruling that struck down the state's `` moment of silence'' law. The law required a one-minute period of silence `` for quiet and private contemplation or introspection'' in state public schools at the beginning of each school day. More than 20 states have similar laws. Under challenges, lower federal courts struck down the law as violating the religion non-establishment clause. Legislative leaders appealed, but later lost their positions, and the high court said they had no standing to appeal. That left basically unresolved the question of whether moment-of-silence laws are constitutional. Two other church-state cases involved claimed religious rights by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. One of them, them, testing whether the ceremonial smoking of the hallucinogenic drug peyote is protected by the First Amendment's free exercise of religious clause, was sent back to the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> It now must decide if the practice violates <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> law. In earlier proceedings, the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> high court held two state employees, both <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, were entitled to unemployment compensation benefits following their firing for smoking the drug in religious ceremonies. In another case, the high court ruled that the federal government may complete a stretch of road through a government-owned section of northwest <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> held sacred by three Indian tribes. Among other church-state cases, the high court: _ Let stand a lower court's ruling that churches must comply with registration and disclosure requirements in a <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> law regulating political activity in referendum campaigns _ Declined to review another case in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> in which a federal appeals court held parents do not have a right to teach their children at home when required reading texts offend their religion

<HEAD>Studies Show More Blacks on Prime Time Network TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FELIX GUTIERREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More blacks are appearing on prime time television shows, and not just in stereotypical roles as cute kids, domestic workers, criminals and jive-talking comedians, according to industry researchers and observers. `` There has been an improvement in the employment of black performers and the range of character portrayals has improved,'' said <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, affirmative action administrator for the Screen Actors Guild. `` No longer are they confined to street types, non-professionals, crime victims and crime perpetrators.'' Some credit the success of `` The Cosby Show'' for opening the doors to more positive black portrayals. A recent <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study of 58 black characters in 26 network shows last season found that, instead of the lower class roles that dominated the 1970s, `` blacks on television are generally portrayed as belonging to middle and upper classes.'' Women played nearly half of the black roles, compared to previous years when men greatly outnumbered them, the Howard researchers reported. The study also noted more middle-age and elderly black characters, fewer obese women and more characters portrayed as competent. Some things have n't changed, the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> scholars found. Blacks were still more likely to be cast in situation comedies than dramas and were most often supporting or minor characters. More than half appeared in shows with black themes, such as `` Amen,'' `` Cosby,'' `` 227'' and `` A Different World.'' `` Black characters continue to be cast primarily in all-black settings,'' wrote <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> communication researchers <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bishetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Matabane </PERSON>. `` Yet there is a notable difference in that these all-black settings tend to be upscale middle class rather than low income.'' A 1987 study by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, found that the number of black characters on TV rose slowly from 1955 to 1965, when only one in 20 was black, and more rapidly since 1975, when one character in 11 has been black. Over the 31 years studied, blacks played 6 percent of all roles. `` The civil rights movement ... opened up attitudes,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Amundson </PERSON>, study co-author. `` White audiences will watch black performers in a wide range of roles, based on the quality of the show, rather than the racial question.'' SAG's <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> credits union affirmative action pressures, advocacy by minority rights groups and the success of black-themed shows for the increasing number of roles. And new shows such as `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place'' and `` In the Heat of the Night'' provided dramatic parts for blacks last season, he said. Black viewers have become more important in the 1980s as overall network audiences dropped in competition with VCRs and cable. But <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he had never heard industry officials say they were improving black roles to attract more black viewers. More blacks watch television than do other racial groupings, according to <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> audience data. A recent <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> viewing analysis reported that television usage averaged 10.6 hours per day in black households, versus 7.3 hours daily in all other homes. With just 11 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television homes headed by blacks, viewing patterns would have to change markedly to directly affect program portrayals, said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television research Vice President <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>. Even with more viewing `` they're still a minority group'' in the TV audience, said <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>. `` If blacks really viewed dramatically different programs than non-blacks then they would have a very substantial effect. But they generally view not all that dissimilarly than the rest of the population.'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, instead of attributing gains in black roles to changing television economics, said white Americans were more receptive to mainstream black characters. `` The attitude of the world toward blacks has changed,'' he said. `` People out there are predisposed to accept this kind of social change.''

 First came the clowns, balloons, cotton candy and coupons for free hamburgers. Then came the hidden fees. The carnival atmosphere that was part of banks' efforts to convince customers to use automated teller machines about a decade ago has turned strictly business-like, now that the era of high-tech consumer banking has clearly caught on. Banks and savings and loans today charge anywhere from 10 cents to $ 3 for ATM services such as cash withdrawals, deposits, transfers or balance inquiries, compared with no fees and little freebies when the machines were first introduced. Financial institutions originaly installed ATMs because they were less costly than human tellers. But they're finding now that their expenses have risen sharply as more of their customers _ about a third on average, or 60 million people nationwide _ regularly use ATMs through expanded regional, state and national automated networks. `` We're providing a much expanded service, 24 hours a day, seven days a week in a lot of locations, and that's pretty expensive,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyer </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Wilber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oneonta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said in defending the fees. ATM fees have become more evident in recent years. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the banking industry's biggest trade group, says that about 25 percent of all banks charged for selected ATM transactions in 1987. That compared with just a handful of banks in 1980 and none the year before. More recenlty, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> newsletter, randomly surveyed 29 big banks and found that in January 1987 about 55 percent of them charged for ATM use. When polled in May, about 70 percent of those same banks imposed fees. Fee structures vary, with some institutions charging more for withdrawals from checking accounts than savings and others waiving fees if balance thresholds are met. Banks charge the most for `` foreign'' transactions at ATMs owned by another bank but linked to a customer's bank through a local or national network. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> estimates the cost of an ATM transaction at `` foreign'' machines is between 57 cents and 66 cents, vs. 40 cents to 56 cents for transactions at a bank's own machine. <PERSON> Moyer </PERSON>, who runs the small upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank, said much of the expense stems from electronic `` switches,'' when banks transfer funds to other banks to cover the withdrawals their customers make. While many industry watchers say most ATM fees are probably justified, they point out that not all customers are aware of these charges. `` Consumers may not know in advance what the ATM fees are. They might show up in unusual debit entries with the end-of-the-month statements,'' explained <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heady </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, newsletter. `` Ten years ago when banking institutions introduced automated teller machines they used clowns, cotton candy and balloons ... to educate you. Now that the institutions have a captive audience they're socking consumers with higher charges ... simply to know things like how much money they have in their accounts.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> says banks have n't run into any major resistance from customers because of the fees. In a recent report it noted, `` ... The fees are user fees which means consumers can elect to pay the fee if they use the service and avoid the fee if they do not use ATMs. `` <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> encourages consumers to take advantage of the competitive environment by shopping for the blend of prices and services that they find most beneficial.''

<HEAD>Drought Puts Spotlight on Underground Irrigation System</HEAD>

 When the country's worst drought in half a century hit this summer, desperate <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> farmers kept co-op extension agent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> LeCureaux </PERSON>'s phone ringing. Many wanted to know about his tests of a low-cost irrigation system that also controls flooding and sharply boosts crop yields. Hard times have given <PERSON> LeCureaux </PERSON> a ready audience for his pitch about the wonders of subirrigation. `` It's not a new concept. It's just being refined,'' he said from the office of the <ORGANIZATION> Huron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which serves farmers in the tip of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s fertile Thumb region, a wide peninsula jutting into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>. In controlled studies last year, subirrigated corn fields produced up to 60 more bushels an acre than non-irrigated fields, <PERSON> LeCureaux </PERSON> said. This year, sugar beets were added to the studies. `` It sure helps in dry seasons,'' said <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kretzschmer </PERSON>, who uses subirrigation on about 200 acres of the 1,800-acre farm he and his brothers operate near <LOCATION> Caseville </LOCATION>. It is one of two county sites where pilot studies are being conducted this year. `` We're kind of going little-by-little now, but eventually, if this works out, we'll irrigate more,'' he said. Kretzschmer and <PERSON> LeCureaux </PERSON> are part of a network of researchers, agricultural agents and farmers who are fine-tuning an irrigation technique first used in 19th century <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Subirrigation is a two-phased water control system that uses underground pipes, drainage ditches and pumps to keep just the right amount of moisture in the field. `` The idea is very old,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouss </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s lab in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. A form of subirrigation was employed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in 1858, he said. `` If the drainage system that you use during wet season can be used to put water back on, then you essentially get it for free,'' <PERSON> Fouss </PERSON> said. Ironically, subirrigation is a system for putting water into fields that once were considered too wet to farm. About 100 million acres of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmland need some kind of drainage in order to grow crops effectively, according to <PERSON> Fouss </PERSON>, who is working to design computer rain forecasts to help run subirrigation systems. Typically, the land is low and flat, with a layer of bedrock or clay within a few feet of the surface, creating a high water table. The soil remains saturated from the spring rains and snowmelt, often forcing farmers to put off planting until late in the growing season. The same problem often occurs in the fall, making it difficult or impossible to harvest the crops. These soil conditions are common along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> seaboard, in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> river basins and in portions of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region, including <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Thumb. But as quickly as farmers installed underground drainage on their land, they began encountering another problem _ drought. Farmers in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> ran into this problem when large-scale drainage projects went in 40 to 50 years ago, said <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Phene </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> scientist in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who did early subirrigation research while working at a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> lab in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, S.C. Farmers who installed underground drain pipes to remove enough water in order to plant in the spring often would find their crops parched for water by summer. But by damming up some of the runoff in the drainage ditches, they found they could put water back into their fields through the same pipes. By hit or miss, farmers discovered that by conserving a certain amount of water in drainage ditches, they could maintain proper moisture in the plants' root zones during drier summer weather as water flowed back into the fields. In prolonged dry weather, however, drainage ditches could n't hold enough water to keep the soil moist, so some farmers began pumping water into the ditches from streams or wells Because of the expense of installing miles of heavy tile pipes, subirrigation made sense only for high-value crops such as vegetables. Now, with the development of lighter plastic piping and laser-guided installation equipment, the system has became feasible for use on field crops as well, <PERSON> Fouss </PERSON> said. `` It's not a major irrigation practice yet, but it's grown quite a bit in the last 10 years,'' <PERSON> Phene </PERSON> said. The appeal of subirrigation, he said, is n't so much that it raises yields but rather that it smooths the ups and downs. `` We want consistent production, a sustainable yield. We're not trying for the maximum yield,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Merva </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who is conducting research on the most effective water levels for subirrigating corn and soy beans. He and other researchers say it is n't yet clear how widely subirrigation can profitably be applied. Although this year's drought has had disastrous consequences for many farmers, it might also prod some into seeking greater independence from natural rainfall, <PERSON> LeCureaux </PERSON> said. This year, farmers are willing to listen. `` If you're looking for a teachable moment,'' he said, `` you've got her.

<HEAD>Bush's Goal Of 30 Million Jobs Is Wishful Thinking</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a dive off the deep end when he pledged to create 30 million jobs over the next eight years, independent economists and even <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> advisers are saying. The wildly optimistic commitment may have been a mathematical error. Or it may have been sheer exuberance. Either way, though, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pledge seems to have been made without much thought to what could be the sleeper issue of the 1990s: labor shortages. Neither party has come to terms with the implications of the ongoing baby bust, says <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattenberg </PERSON>, senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and author of a 1987 book, `` The Birth Dearth'' -LRB- Pharos Books -RRB-. The annual birth rate per 1,000 women has fallen from 23 in 1960 to 15 last year and is projected to fall farther to 13 in the year 2000. Given those figures, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be hard-pressed to find people to fill even 20 million new jobs in the next eight years _ unless, of course, it opened the doors to massive immigration, which seems unlikely. `` The lack of a substantial number of young people coming into the labor force will create major economic dislocations, which can cause great trouble in employment markets,'' <PERSON> Wattenberg </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We've never lived through something like this in this country. We've always been growing, growing, growing. And I think it's a serious problem,'' he said. While public policies have not done much to cope with labor shortages, businesses have already been forced to respond creatively. Businesses are massively increasing on-the-job training because they ca n't hire people with the skills they need. In some cases, the skills in question are simple reading, writing and arithmetic. The fast-food industry is hiring retirees and busing workers from inner cities to restaurants in labor-short suburbs. Coming soon are robots that will flip hamburgers, stuff burritos and spread pizza dough. <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> offers free training on computers, no strings attached. `` If you train an individual, they do develop a certain loyalty to you,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Anton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s executive vice president. Labor shortages are most apparent in fields such as food service and baby - sitting But equally critical, perhaps more so, are the shortages of qualified people at the highest ranks of the labor force: engineers, for example. Thirty percent of the electronics industry's engineers are immigrants, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>. If they chose to stop coming, perhaps because of improving opportunities in their home countries, such as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, this nation would be in a severe quandary. The problems of a low birth rate are compounded by societal problems that have left millions of citizens unable or sometimes unwilling to take on the challenges of the job market. With more than 500 jobs open in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s furniture industry, only 60 people are enrolled in classes at the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. `` People in the city are not being connected with careers that actually exist,'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> recently. Better education, training and social support, especially for disadvantaged minorities, would obviously help the labor shortage. But in the long run, nothing would help more than a higher birth rate. That's where <PERSON> Wattenberg </PERSON>'s political proposal comes in _ to encourage more births through education allowances, child allowances, more generous maternal leave, better child care. <PERSON> Wattenberg </PERSON> has been faulted for pushing women to have more babies, but he says the criticism is unfair. `` I just want to make it easier for people to have the option to do what they want. ... There are a substantial number of people who would like to have children, but it's getting damn hard these days.''

 Like other 40-year-olds, Sunday night's Emmy Awards is fighting to stay youthful While liposuction has yet to be contemplated, the `` 40th Annual Prime Time Emmy Awards'' are being produced this year by someone who has built a career out of spoofing the very medium the Emmys are intended to celebrate. <PERSON> Lorne </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>, as the creator and original producer of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Saturday Night Live,'' has excelled at trashing television from top to bottom, from biting game-show and newscast parodies to scathing `` Highway Patrol'' and `` <PERSON> Ozzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON>'' send-ups But can <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> satirize the Emmys themselves? `` Well, this show wo n't take itself too seriously,'' <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> said. If the Emmy telecast, carried live by the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at 8 p.m. EDT, has suffered in the past, it has sprung from its unerring aptitude for boredom _ last year's ceremony, at four hours, was just 20 seconds shy of qualifying for a miniseries. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> said `` too many awards'' are handed out at the Emmys. That he ca n't change. `` So, in trying to make the show entertaining, what I've tried to do is strip it down to its core _ the awards _ and make that go as quickly as possible, and then try to weave the entertainment parts through it.'' <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> promised there would not be any production numbers `` per se,'' whatever that means, and he said he would `` try to squeeze some comedy'' into the usually dull Governors Award, given this year to animators <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>, a six-time Emmy winner, will be joined in the control booth at the <ORGANIZATION> Pasadena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the longtime `` Saturday Night Live'' director. And he plans to use several celebrities, including <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, as hosts rather than depend on an individual. It's hard to say if another new Emmy twist is serious or not. In one of the stranger moves in Emmy lore, this year's Emmy statuette, normally cast in gold, pewter and iron, is being played by a person. The human Emmy is Norwegian actress <PERSON> Benedikte </PERSON> <PERSON> Handal </PERSON>. `` We talked to over a hundred women before we found <PERSON> Benedikte </PERSON> <PERSON> Handal </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a vice president of off-air promotion for <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>. `` She had the ethereal quality we were looking for.'' <PERSON> Handal </PERSON> is being used in national television advertisements for the awards broadcast, and her `` ethereal qualities'' will also be displayed in posters and newspaper spots plugging the show. <PERSON> Handal </PERSON> will not, however, be handed out to award winners. The closer Emmy races this year revolve around <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s hot drama series `` L.A. Law'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> newcomer `` Beauty and the Beast.'' For the second year in a row, `` L.A. Law'' gathered more nominations, 19, than any other television program. The series will be competing for best drama series, best actor in a drama series for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> and best actress in a drama series for <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dey </PERSON>. `` Beauty and the Beast,'' an improbable hit about a love affair between an attorney and a hulking, hairy denizen of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s underground, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s geriatric comedy `` The Golden Girls'' tied for the second-most nominations with 12 apiece The nominees for best drama series, in addition to `` L.A. Law'' and `` Beauty and the <LOCATION> Beast </LOCATION>,'' are <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` thirtysomething'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s recently canceled `` St. Elsewhere.'' Joining `` The Golden Girls'' in the race for best comedy series are <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Wonder Years,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers'' and `` Night Court'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Frank's Place,'' which has yet to be placed on the network's fall schedule The nominees for best miniseries are <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Baby M'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Billionaire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>'s Lincoln'' and `` The Murder of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Phagan </PERSON>. Up for best actor in a drama series are `` L.A. Law's'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> from `` Beauty and the <LOCATION> Beast </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Equalizer'' and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>, star of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Year in the Life. Competing for best actor in a comedy series are <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Danson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Family Ties,'' <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> from `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, star of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Hooperman'' and <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, the lead in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s canceled `` The ` Slap' Maxwell Story.'' On the women's side, the nominees for best actress in a drama series, joining `` L.A. Law's'' <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dey </PERSON>, are <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Murder, She Wrote'' and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gless </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tyne </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, co-stars of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>.'' The finalists for best actress in a comedy series are <LOCATION> Kirstie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s canceled `` The Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>,'' and three actresses _ <PERSON> Rue </PERSON> <PERSON> McClanahan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> _ from `` The Golden Girls.'' Television's most popular program, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show,'' collected just one nomination, for a guest performance by <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckart </PERSON>; its spinoff, `` A Different World,'' the second most popular show, had none. For the first time in Emmy history, cable television programs are eligible for trophies, although chances are slim that any cable show will emerge with that strong a showing. The cable shows drew 15 of the 337 nominations their first time out _ Home Box Office and <PERSON> Showtime </PERSON> each collected six nominations, the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> drew two and <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> had one. Among the cable companies' best chances for an Emmy are best writing in a comedy series -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Showtime </ORGANIZATION>'s `` It's <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shandling </PERSON>'s Show'' is nominated twice -RRB- and best informational special -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>'s acclaimed `` Dear America: Letters Home From Vietnam'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> leads the three networks with 114 nominations, followed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> with 87 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> with 75. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> gathered 27 nominations and <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, struggling to become television's `` fourth network,'' drew six In addition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the awards show will be broadcast to 21 foreign countries, representing a potential audience of 1 million viewers. Countries planning to broadcast the Emmy program live include <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Wide Differences in Child Diabetes Risk Highlight Basic Mystery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 White children in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> face only about half the risk of getting the most serious form of diabetes as Finnish children, suggests new research that found an inexplicable 17-fold difference in risk across 14 nations. The risk of insulin-dependent diabetes runs generally generally higher in cooler climates, said researchers, who are studying such differences for clues to the far more basic question of what causes insulin-dependent diabetes. The disease occurs because the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas have been destroyed by a misguided attack by the body's immune system The 1 million Americans with it must inject themselves with insulin every day to stay alive. Otherwise, sugar will build up in their blood and cause such complications as heart and kidney disease, blindness and nerve damage. Genes clearly play a key role in triggering the immune system's attack The vast majority of people who develop insulin-dependent diabetes have particular genes linked to the disease. However, most people with the susceptible genetic background do not develop diabetes, and the geographic variation in rates is evidence of an environmental role, said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPorte </PERSON>, associate professor in the epidemiology department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. Studies also suggest that rates for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children younger than 15 more than doubled from 1947 to 1976, which argues for a change in the environment, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Warram </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Joslin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. What could this environmental factor be? Viral infections are one theory, since viruses show seasonal and temperature preferences as does insulin-dependent diabetes. Diet is another proposed trigger, with some support from animal studies. The question is complicated because the immune system starts attacking the pancreas years before a person shows diabetes symptoms. So any trigger must have acted at some unknown time in the past, said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rotter </PERSON> also said much of the geographic difference in rates may be due to differing prevalence of the susceptibility genes in various populations, rather than just environmental causes. Geographic differences are highlighted in a new study by an international team of scientists who compared insulin-dependent diabetes rates in children under age 15 from 14 countries. Their work appears in the August issue of the journal Diabetes. Rates ranged from 1.7 cases per 100,000 `` person-years'' in <LOCATION> Hokkaido </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, to 29.5 cases per 100,000 person-years in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. A person-year is like a man-hour; it represents the equivalent of following one person for one year. Within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the rates per 100,000 person-years also showed variation: 9.4 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, 11.4 in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, 13.4 in <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Penn. </LOCATION>, 15.1 in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, 17.8 in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and 20.8 in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>. Those figures are not adjusted for ethnic differences, which play a role because whites have higher rates than nonwhites. For example, figures for white children only give a rate of 13.8 for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and 16.9 for <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s rises to 20.3 and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>'s dips to 20.6. The study's overall variation was most pronounced for children younger than 5, suggesting the unknown environmental agent may exert more influence in that population, said <PERSON> LaPorte </PERSON>. `` It seems to be affecting the youngest children the most, whatever it is.''

 Oil futures prices weakened in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly report on supplies of energy products. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for October delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, fell 21 cents a barrel to close at $ 15.70 on Tuesday. Tuesday was the first day of trading in the October spot contract. Trading in the September contract expired Monday. Contracts for October delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline slipped 0.23 cent to finish at 44.93 cents a gallon. Prices for other contract months also declined. Wholesale heating oil for October dropped 0.79 cent a gallon to 44.67 cents a gallon. Analysts said Tuesday's energy futures market was influenced by trader expectations that the API's weekly report, released after the close of trading, would show higher inventories of oil products, particularly oil. The report indicated that while stocks of gasoline and distillates rose last week, crude oil inventories declined by nearly 4.3 million barrels. Analysts had expected a buildup of 2 million to 4 million barrels of crude, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Azarow </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The API reported gasoline stocks were up 349,000 barrels and distillate stocks rose 2.1 million barrels. Analysts said the oil futures market has lacked direction in recent weeks outside of the weekly API reports. The market is awaiting fresh news affecting supply and demand and, particularly, developments involving the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, they say. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> intervened to stop the fighting between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, both <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members.

 <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is looking for a new chairman and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> may be in the market for some new corporate dealmaking. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a reknowned takeover artist, is resigning as <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s chairman, the company announced Tuesday, as the company moves further from megabuck wheeling and dealing to focus on running its three main foodmaking companies <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentschler </PERSON>, 49, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s president and chief executive officer since June 1987, will continue running the privately-held company on a daily basis. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 66, still will play a role as a director and major investor in <LOCATION> Beatrice </LOCATION>, but several analysts see his resignation, effective Oct. 1, as a sign <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> wants to deal himself back into the high-stakes game of corporate mergers and acquisitions. `` I think <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was put on this earth to do deals and I think his leaving just reflects that he wants to get back in the game,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON>, a food industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> also is losing two key managers brought on board by <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> _ J.S. <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>, 45, senior vice president of finance, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON>, 57, senior vice president of strategic planning. `` The fact that he took his top financial guy and his top operating guy with him indicates to me that they'll be looking for another company to run,'' <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> likes to play poker. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> likes to do deals. He's not going to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to retire and play golf.'' <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sode </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s vice president of corporate relations, said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was not available for comment Tuesday. She also said she did not know, and would not speculate on, his future plans. In a statement released by the company, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said: `` We have helped shape <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> into a successful, highly focused, top-quality consumer products company and accomplished this at a faster pace than we had originally planned. Today our operating units have better market shares and better overall operating profits'' than before a $ 6.2 billion leveraged buyout engineered by <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> in 1986. Reporting directly to <PERSON> Renstschler </PERSON> will be the chiefs of <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s three major foodmaking companies: <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosson </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunt-Wesson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lochmann </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Swift-Eckrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cheese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This transition from <PERSON> Don </PERSON> to <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> really is in keeping with <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s focus as an operating company now and with the fact that it's no longer going to be involved in restructuring and acquisitions,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sode </PERSON> said. `` Don's forte, of course, has been in the dealmaking.'' The 1986 leveraged buyout that took <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> private, with financial backing from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was one of the biggest such deals in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate history. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with the target company's cash flow or with money raised by the sale of its assets. Since the buyout, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> has sold more than $ 7 billion in assets, including its <ORGANIZATION> Tropicana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> fruit juice division, <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> group of companies, and its bottled water division. The company still produces such products as Hunt tomato sauce, <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Redenbacher </PERSON> popcorn, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oriental </ORGANIZATION> foods, Butterball turkeys and County Line cheeses. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was chairman, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Esmark </ORGANIZATION>, which made Swift meats and <ORGANIZATION> Hunt-Wesson </ORGANIZATION> products, when it was acquired by <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> in 1984 after a bidding war with <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>. He then left to form his own company before turning the tables and negotiating the <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> buyout in 1986 for a total purchase price and financing of $ 8.4 billion, the company said. In the fiscal year ended Feb. 29, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> had net sales of $ 4.01 billion, but reported a loss from continuing operations of $ 105 million because of remaining debt from the buyout, Ms. <PERSON> Sode </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The surprise announcement that <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> will leave the chairman's post at <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is no reason for managers to breathe any easier at companies in need of turnarounds. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s personal war chest, garnered from sharp dealmaking, golden parachutes and willing lenders, virtually guarantees that he'll resurface on the takeover scene before long, experts say. For a man who orchestrated one of the biggest leveraged buyouts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate history, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 66, is likely to keep doing what he does best: turning deals. `` It sounds to me as if <PERSON> Don </PERSON> ... -LRB- is -RRB- regrouping to try to do something new,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's been widely speculated that <PERSON> Don </PERSON> wants to start'' a new dealmaking company. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s resignation from <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, effective Oct. 1, was announced Tuesday. Observers had been expecting <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> to spin off part of <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> as a vehicle for acquisitions, particularly after last month's announcement that for the first time since the $ 6.2 billion buyout that took <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> private in 1986, the company was not for sale But <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> may not need an operations base. `` Don's track record will carry with him wherever he goes,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierbusse </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` He is regarded as a very savvy individual,'' and companies <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> may have targeted `` can be nervous about him,'' <PERSON> Bierbusse </PERSON> said. And who would n't be concerned about a man who once said he gets `` more nervous about a 6-foot putt than a billion-dollar deal.'' Under <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s leadership, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> sold off some $ 7 billion in assets _ from <LOCATION> Tropicana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> juice </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> units to a <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> bottler to Max Factor cosmetics. But rumors have been circulating that <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> has had a falling out with <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the aggressive <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> buyout firm that backed his <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> deal. As <PERSON> Bierbusse </PERSON> sees it, a conflict may have arisen over whether to sell what remained of <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> as a whole or in parts. `` If I wanted to go it alone, I could probably raise a lot of money without <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> told Fortune magazine last month. `` But I believe that <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> always needs someone of equal or greater power than he.'' Short on modesty and high-brow education but long on instinct, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was raised on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s rough-and-tumble South Side, starting work at a gas station when he was barely a teen-ager. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a one-time <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> torpedoman, was known as a quick decision maker as he worked his way up the corporate ladder at <ORGANIZATION> Swift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. While traveling the country as many as 50 weeks out of the year for <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> built relationships with the rank-and-file over countless beers and cups of coffee. He knew he could `` get the benefit of 50 years' experience at Swift'' just by sitting in a tavern with an employee, he told Fortune. By 1977, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was raking in a six-figure salary as chief executive of the food conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Esmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the new name for <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, which he skillfully pruned and pared. When <ORGANIZATION> Esmark </ORGANIZATION> was acquired by <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> in 1984, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was believed to have made as much as $ 20 million. Two years later, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> won his own battle for Chicago-based <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>. Backed by <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> took the company private in a $ 6.2 billion deal made under the premise that the whole was worth less than its parts. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> then formed <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a conglomerate made up of <LOCATION> Beatrice </LOCATION> subsidiaries, with the intention that it would buy and sell other companies through leveraged transactions. But E-II was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.7 billion earlier this year after <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> made a bid to take over that company. Proceeds from the E-II sale were estimated to have put $ 50 million in <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s pocket, in addition to a golden parachute severance agreement valued at about $ 2.5 million. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was unavailable to comment on his future plans. But as he told <PERSON> Fortune </PERSON>, `` I can be very convincing and very hard to change when I get going on something. I get going like a freight train ...'' Observers are certain of only one thing. As one put it, `` he ai n't gon na retire.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it discussed increasing an employee stock ownership plan `` long before there was any whisper'' of a takeover bid from <ORGANIZATION> Roy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investment firm owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> family, claimed in a lawsuit filed in July that <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> improperly increased an employee stock ownership plan from 5 percent to 14 percent to help thwart an unwanted acquisition <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, a vice chancellor of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION>, scheduled hearings for Oct. 19-25 on <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s suit to halt the expansion, a court clerk said Tuesday. Cambridge-based <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> is a Delaware-chartered corporation. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s takeover law prohibits acquirers who obtain 15 percent of a company's stock from completing a takeover for three years, unless they have approval from the target's board of directors or acquire at least 85 percent of the target's stock. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLima </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president and secretary, said Tuesday the company's board of directors had considered increasing the size of the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> after it first was approved in March. `` By the time of the July -LRB- board -RRB- meeting, we were aware of <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s interest in the company and were thoughtful about whether our plans for the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> might be interfered with,'' he said. <PERSON> DeLima </PERSON> said that in the period between the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>'s approval and its increase, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s board determined it could increase the size of the stock issue to 10 million shares with `` relatively modest'' reductions in pay and benefits. On Aug. 16, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> rejected a sweetened takeover proposal from Shamrock of $ 40 per share and 40 percent of any settlement in <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.7 billion patent infringement case against <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, which owns 6.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, contends <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> increased the number of shares in the stock issue after getting wind of its bid The increased <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> was announced July 12 as part of a reorganization that included the $ 300 million stock purchase plan, up to 800 layoffs and entry into the conventional film market. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> last week announced it was targeting 1,500 early retirements in a streamlining effort aimed at fighting the takeover. One Wall Street securities analyst said that because employees who own the stock can decide whether to sell their shares, a hostile takeover of Polaroid technically is not impossible despite the 14 percent employee control. `` As a practical matter, it really does make it harder,'' said the analyst, who asked not to be named. `` The legal fiction is that each employee is an individual stockholder. ... They can play the arbitrage business too.''

<HEAD>Texans Applaud Windfall Profits Tax Repeal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil producers and politicians say the repeal of the federal windfall profits tax is only the first step needed to help revive the oil and gas industry. Financial incentives for exploration and to keep marginally producing wells in operation also are needed, oilmen say. The landmark trade bill President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed into law Tuesday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> included the repeal of the eight-year-old windfall profits tax on oil companies. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royalty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the trade group had fought for repeal since the tax was signed into law in 1980. The windfall profits tax was enacted in exchange for the phase-out of price controls on domestic oil. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was attempting to recapture some of the money oil companies were expected to make when prices increased after full decontrol began in 1981. About $ 77.3 billion in taxes have been collected since it was imposed. Although low oil prices have kept oil companies from paying much windfall profits tax during the past 2 -LCB- years, oil producers still have had to certify their production and report it to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. The base crude oil price upon which the tax is levied is between $ 19 and $ 20 a barrel for independent producers, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. Crude oil sold for about $ 15 a barrel Tuesday. `` Of course, when you're not paying any tax, and it gets repealed, it's not going to have a whole lot of immediate monetary effect on you,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` Some accounting work will be taken off our back, hopefully.'' Both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, played prominent roles in the effort to repeal the tax. `` It is in fact the first positive step <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has taken on oil in a decade,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Tuesday. `` They -LRB- oil companies -RRB- wo n't have to figure in this confiscatory tax in figuring their benefits.'' But <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said that to further help the beleaguered oil and gas industry, federal financial incentives are needed for marginal and stripper wells. Stripper wells generally produce less than 10 barrels of oil a day. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> are considered marginal if production is low in comparison to the amount of revnue obtained, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. He also tax credits are needed for exploratory wells. Major oil companies fared well in the last quarter, said <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, whose organization includes about 4,000 independent producers and royalty owners. `` Independents, on the other hand are still struggling. They're still falling by the wayside,'' he said <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said the oil industry has continued to pay an estimated $ 100 million in complying with the tax rules during each of the past two years, even though oil companies have paid only small amounts of the actual tax. The federal government has spent about $ 15 million each of the past two years for paperwork overseeing the tax, he said. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said other measures, including tax incentives to spur drilling and deregulation of gas prices, are still needed to boost the industry.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower Against Most Currencies, Gold Falls Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell against most major foreign currencies in early European trading today following remarks by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON>. Gold prices also fell slightly in extremely quiet trading. The dollar slid after <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> said the West German mark's decline was `` inexplicable'' and termed a further drop in the yen as undesirable. Selling pressure on the dollar then intensified when dealers reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank, was selling dollars on the open market. `` No matter how well-bid the dollar still is, after the massive interventions of the past few days, a pause is needed,'' said one senior trader in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. But he stressed that market sentiment remains favorable toward the dollar and that the currency could still rebound. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.37 yen to a closing 134.30 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 134.20 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8957 West German marks, down from 1.9060; 1.5990 Swiss francs, down from 1.6055; 6.4415 French francs, down from 6.4635; 2.1395 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1440; 1,406.00 Italian lire, down from 1,407.50; and 1.2305 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2303 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was unchanged from late Tuesday at $ 1.6795. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 432 a troy ounce and at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 432.10. Both were down from Tuesday's late bid of $ 432.75. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 432.10, down from $ 433 bid late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 59 cents to close at a bid $ 434. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 6.73 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $ 6.74.

<HEAD>Fed Cattle Prices Up Sharply in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices of fed cattle are topping $ 70 per hundredweight in late August, up sharply from $ 66 in July, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The recent price strength reflects tighter supplies of finished -LRB- fattened -RRB- cattle, stronger export demand and continued brisk movement at retail,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. In all, cattle slaughter in August may rise only 8 percent from July, although there are two additional working days this month, which would suggest as much as a 10 percent increase from July, the agency reported. `` Cow slaughter has begun picking up,'' the report said. `` However, this appears to be a seasonal movement of beef cows off grass -LRB- pasture -RRB- rather than a forced drought movement.'' There had been an increase in cow slaughter earlier this summer as some producers in the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and in the lakes states were forced to send beef and dairy cows to market because of feed shortages. In many cases, however, quality breeding animals have been purchased by producers in other areas where feed is available, thus forestalling massive sell-offs of herds. According to federal inspection reports, the slaughter of beef cows this year through the first week in August totaled about 1.89 million head, down 9 percent from the same period in 1987. airy cow slaughter, at 1.66 million head, dropped 3 percent Prices of fed cattle in the southern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> are selling for more than $ 70 per 100 pounds of live weight in late August, up from $ 66 in July, the report said. Beef from cows goes mainly into hamburger and processing, while grain-fed steers and heifers provide the higher-grade cuts found in supermarkets. Looking at pork, the report said weekly slaughter is expected to increase sharply in September, pushing prices down. Meanwhile, hot weather has disrupted marketings and slowed weight gains of hogs. That has lent some support to `` an otherwise weak market'' this summer, the report said. Wholesale prices of dressed broiler chickens in early August remained around 70 cents a pound, well above the 53 cents of a year earlier. Prices should average around 61 to 65 cents a pound during the third quarter, the report said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says farmers have developed conservation plans for protecting 54 million acres of highly erodible cropland, about 38 percent of the 143 million acres targeted for protection by the 1985 farm law. Wilson Scaling, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that plans have been put into effect on 17 million acres, or about 12 percent of the affected land. Under the 1985 law, farmers who raise crops on highly erodible land must have a conservation plan approved by Dec. 31, 1989, and implement it fully by Dec. 31, 1994, to remain eligible for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> program benefits. `` We are on target for meeting the 1989 deadline,'' Scaling said. `` We hope to have 65 percent of the plans completed by the end of 1988 and the remaining 35 percent completed by the end of 1989.'' However, Scaling cautioned farmers not to wait until the last minute to request technical assistance from <ORGANIZATION> SCS </ORGANIZATION> because they might have a long wait.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Figgie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which moved its corporate headquarters to suburban <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> in 1982, is returning to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported today. Cleveland Councilman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> that the company will build a new headquarters on 600 acres of city-owned land just outside <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Warrensville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Figgie </ORGANIZATION> will buy the land from city, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said. `` There are several reasons'' for <ORGANIZATION> Figgie </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to leave <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> is within 500 miles of nearly 60 percent of the nation's population. It is a strategic location and it is hot for development now.'' The move will add at least 1,500 jobs to the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> area and possibly as many as 15,000 when operations are at full steam, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said. Officials in <LOCATION> Henrico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Figgie </ORGANIZATION> bought 1,500 acres in 1982, said they had done everything they could to persuade the company to stay. `` I'm sorry to see them leave,'' said Supervisor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>. `` Certainly we'd like to have them here. I think they're quite an asset to <LOCATION> Henrico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but the land stays here I'm sure that there will be others to come and I'm sure that there will be others to go.'' Figgie officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday night. A news conference was scheduled for 3 p.m. today in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> to make a formal announcement of the move, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Figgie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, had said in April that the company moved to <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> from its former headquarters in <LOCATION> Willoughby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, because of the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> city's stable labor climate, good general business conditions and access to transportation systems He said there would have to be an economic reason to move back to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Revenues in 1987 for the diversified company, which makes a range of products from baseballs to fire trucks, were a record $ 1.02 billion, up 11 percent from 1986. Its 1987 profits were $ 49.3 million, up from $ 42.4 million in 1986. Sales in the first quarter of this year increased 12 percent over the same period last year. The paper reported that sources said tax advantages lured the company to move to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` I would think it's more than some tax abatement,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, citing the expense of moving. `` There have to be a lot of issues.''

 About 300 longshoremen protesting the use of non-union labor to load explosives onto a military ship have been ordered to return to work by a federal judge. A temporary restraining order was issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> against members of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longshoreman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 1408 </ORGANIZATION>, who had refused to return to work at <LOCATION> Blount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> until the ship left port. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, president of the ILA local, said the workers would immediately comply with the judge's order. The court order was requested by the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represented the owners of four ships filled with Hondas, Mazdas, Isuzus and Subarus waiting to be unloaded by the ILA. The union had refused to unload the ships to protest the use of non-union labor by <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> to load explosives on a military ship. A similar work stoppage occurred on June 20 when the union refused to work when the same company unloaded explosives from another military ship. The union claimed the use of non-union labor to handle the explosives was unsafe because the workers were inexperienced in handling the devices. The judge's injunction will remain in effect until Sept. 2 when the union and the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> will meet in his courtroom. The judge asked the two parties to try and work out their differences by that time. The next scheduled work by <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> is Sept. 8 when it will unload explosives from a ship.

 Kids are changing in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, appearing to lose interest in some of the world's most timeless creatures _ bugs. Purveyors of insects say modern entertainments like computer games have slowed their sales to a crawl. `` This has been a terrible year for sales,'' said <PERSON> Mitsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Otsuka </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Insect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corner </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Takashimaya </ORGANIZATION> department store. <PERSON> Otsuka </PERSON> said the store used to sell $ 380 to $ 480 worth of insects on a good Sunday. `` Now we're lucky if we can sell half that much,'' he said. In rural <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the sight of a child with net out to nab a cicada or dragonfly is common. But in the city, <PERSON> Otsuka </PERSON> and other bug salesmen say hopping insects are no match for modern diversions. `` It's computer games. Kids are more interested in machines these days,'' <PERSON> Otsuka </PERSON> said. Even so, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Takashimaya </ORGANIZATION> expects to sell about $ 6,000 worth of bugs this year. The bug-hunting season in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> hits its peak in early July and lasts through August. Rural children collect the bugs near their homes and keep them in plastic cages sold at local pet stores. The children also are encouraged to bring their bugs to school, where they are studied in science classes. No one knows when the summer pastime began among Japanese children, but ancient scrolls contain pictures of people keeping bugs in their homes. To city kids, the hunting ground is often the rooftops of department stores like <ORGANIZATION> Takashimaya </ORGANIZATION>, where such exotic creatures as the coleopteran, cricket and stag beetle are easy prey _ for the right price. A clerk at the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyu </ORGANIZATION> department store's pet shop said she had sold a 3-inch male stag beetle for $ 770 early this month. `` But only insect-crazy adults buy those bugs, not kids.'' A medium-range item, she said, was a pair of smaller stag beetles. The beetles, which came with a plastic cage, dirt and a few slices of rotting eggplant, were priced at $ 77. `` It's a real buy,'' she said. `` Until yesterday the price was 15,000 yen -LRB- $ 115 -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Otsuka </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Takashimaya </ORGANIZATION> does n't sell pricey insects anymore, and relies on the smaller stag beetles, the Homoeogryllus japanicus, or bell-ringing insect and the coleopteran, or Atlas beetle. Most of <PERSON> Otsuka </PERSON>'s insects were selling for $ 1.54 to $ 4.60. `` The male Atlas beetle is the most popular with the kids because its ` horns' are shaped like a samurai helmet,'' he said, referring to the ancient Japanese warriors. `` When I was a child growing up in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> they did n't sell bugs in department stores,'' said <PERSON> Otsuka </PERSON>, who has been in charge of <ORGANIZATION> Takashimaya </ORGANIZATION>'s bugs for the past 10 years. `` But children now have less chance to see insects in their natural environment. It's very sad to think that they have lost interest.''

 Employees of the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, Ill.-based <ORGANIZATION> Horace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> should not have to worry about moving after <ORGANIZATION> Cigna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced it would sell the insurance subsidiary to a new corporation for $ 500 million, officials said. The investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Gibbons </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON>, a management buyout specialist, arranged and will finance the cash purchase announced Tuesday. Investors in the new corporation will include <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kardos </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, as well as other <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> senior managers and <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kardos </PERSON> said the new arrangement would ensure <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s remaining a major business in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cigna </ORGANIZATION> had announced Aug. 3, 1987, that it would sell <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. `` When it was announced that we were on the block ... there was a lot of speculation and there were a lot of questions being asked,'' <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> employs more than 2,600 people nationwide, about 1,400 of them in the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> area, and speculation centered on whether a new buyer would move or cut back. `` No one could say that would or would n't happen'' until Tuesday's announcement, <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON> said of such questions. `` There's no plans for that.'' The agreement, the 26th management buyout in the 19-year history of <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON>, is subject to regulatory approval and completion of undisclosed financial arrangements. `` The sale of <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> is a further step in an effort to better focus our strategic emphasis on commercially oriented insurance and investment products,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cigna </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilpatrick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kardos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> has had `` a constructive relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Cigna </ORGANIZATION>,'' but said all parties in the deal would benefit. `` <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> will have the independence to control its own destiny and maintain the management philosophy and employee relations upon which the company has been built,'' <PERSON> Kardos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> sells personal life, auto and homeowners insurance, as well as group and annuity products primarily to the educational market. The company had 1987 revenues of $ 720 million with assets of almost $ 2 billion. Its book value as of June 30 was about $ 340 million.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wednesday </ORGANIZATION> reiterated it will defend its international trade rights if these are damaged by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade bill President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has signed into law. EEC External Relations Commissioner <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said in a statement the bill confirmed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tendency `` to interpret international trading rules unilaterally.'' `` The Community stands ready to defend its legitimate interests each time these are threatened by unilateral measures ... by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities on the basis of the trade bill,'' he said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said he would seek an `` adequate'' <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> response to the bill when the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> meet here Sept. 26. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> had trade rights in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the international trade organization, and that it will `` defend them if necessary.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the trade bill into law on Tuesday. Among others things, it gives <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators more bargaining room at international trade talks, boosts <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ability to fight restrictive trade policies of other nations and allows the president to block foreign investments if these are seen to impair <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> objects to portions of the bill including a section raising retaliatory powers in trade and to the extension for two years of the Export Enhancement Program. The program pays surplus farm commodities from government bins to exporters to boost overseas sales. The program has a price tag of $ 2.5 billion. A <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> `` will check, on a case-by-case basis, to see how the bill is implemented but we first want a reaction from the member states.'' He noted that the bill's contents clashed with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s strong views on free trade guarantees. The president signed the bill and, in a speech, acknowledged `` it could lead to an import fee that would be illegal according to international law and inconsistent with our goal of moving toward a free world trade.'' In his statement, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had declared at the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> summit of industrialized nations in June that `` nations must continue to resist protectionism and the temptation to adopt unilateral measures.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> also was party to the declaration.

<HEAD>Harcourt Brace to Lay Off 750 Theme Park Workers</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> ORLANDO </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> _ The dismissal of 750 workers in six <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> theme parks around the country is part of a `` belt-tightening'' program by the parent of Sea World and other facilities, executives said. The layoffs announced Tuesday affect about 10 percent of the park system's 7,500 full-time employees, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evanson </PERSON>, a senior vice president and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION>'s parks operation. They include nearly 350 layoffs in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` Employee cuts are a routine part of any corporate belt-tightening. We will be a more efficient company,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which will lose about 150 employees. Orlando-based <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION>, a major publishing company, reported a net loss of $ 62.9 million on revenue of $ 446.6 million in the second quarter. The company repelled an unwelcome takeover bid last year from British publishing magnate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> by adopting a $ 3 billion recapitalization plan and plunging into debt before selling off several assets. A total of 334 workers have received layoff notices at company facilities in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, including 113 at <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, 161 at <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION> and Baseball near <LOCATION> Haines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and 60 at Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven. An additional nine park support workers will be laid off from corporate headquarters. About 215 employees were fired Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> operates another Sea World in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, but there was no word on job cuts there. The fired workers, ranging in experience from several months to more than 15 years, will leave no later than Sept. 6. Departments involving care of the parks' animals and direct services to park visitors were largely spared. `` The lines are n't going to be any longer at the food stands or anything like that,'' said <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>. `` Animals will continue to receive the world-class care that they're used to. Those areas barely have been touched.'' <PERSON> Evanson </PERSON>, 51, was appointed to the park system chairmanship Monday, replacing <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, who resigned last month amid a management reorganization. <PERSON> Evanson </PERSON> has been with <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> since 1985 and previously served as deputy for publishing. Without being specific, he said the newer parks in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> had the largest cutbacks. The company's theme parks employ about 7,500 full-time employees and bring in seasonal help during the peak summer months to push the system's work force to 11,000 or 12,000. Most of the temporary workers are laid off soon after Labor Day. All of Tuesday's layoffs involved the permanent work force. Despite the layoffs, <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s shows and other attractions will remain unchanged.

<HEAD>Papers Ask for Union Support in JOA Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Detroit's two major daily newspapers are asking their six unions to support an attempt to overturn a 30-day stay blocking implementation of the joint operating agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and The Detroit News on Tuesday asked the unions, which originally opposed the partial merger, to sign briefs asking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to overturn the decision. <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> is to hold a hearing Sept. 8. The unions represent 80 percent of the 4,200 employees at both papers. Union officials were mixed on whether they would comply with the papers' request. `` I imagine we're probably going to sign it, unless there's something in there we really ca n't agree with,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Mailers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> Local 2040 `` I'm against it, the way that thing is worded,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kummer </PERSON>, administrative officer of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> general manager, said the three-page brief says the papers are convinced `` that the Free Press is in probable danger of financial failure.'' Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> approved a joint operating agreement between the two newspapers Aug. 8. On Aug. 17, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> issued an order blocking the partial merger, saying there was a strong likelihood <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> opponents could have <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision overturned. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, has said it would close the paper if the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> is denied.

 The stock market pushed broadly higher today after losing ground over the past three sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which has fallen nearly 38 points over the past three sessions to its lowest level since late May, was up 10.49 at 1,999.82 after 30 minutes of trading. Advancing issues outpaced losers by a margin of 5 to 3 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 493 up, 296 down and 588 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume amounted to 18.09 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street compared with 22.63 million shares on Tuesday. The market has been trending lower all month in sluggish trading. Investors have generally shown little inclination to buy stocks because they are fearful that the recent pace of economic expansion is strong enough that inflation is likely to pick up. On Tuesday, the government reported that consumer prices were up modestly in July while orders for durable goods tumbled. But while the reports sparked a mild rally in bond prices, stocks failed to follow through. Nonetheless, some analysts feel a mild rebound may be coming because stocks have fallen so far in the past few weeks. Stock traders are also looking toward the government's report set for release on Thursday of its latest revision in second-quarter economic growth. Among the early active issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Light was unchanged at 29, <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> was down -LRB- at 13 and Zayre was up -LCB- at 22 -LCB-. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index was up 0.45 at 146.39. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the composite index was up 0.46 at 292.46. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average lost 0.89 to close at 1,989.33. That is its lowest close since it ended at 1,956.44 on May 27.

 The nation's trade deficit for the second quarter posted the biggest improvement in more than five years, narrowing by 14.9 percent, the government reported today. The news boosted the dollar on world currency markets. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency was quoted at around 134.35 Japanese yen shortly after the release of the trade figure, up from 134.11 yen late Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The dollar had surged Tuesday in spite of continued efforts by major central banks to restrain it. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said a record level of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports and the first quarterly decline in imports in three years pushed the deficit down to $ 29.9 billion in the second quarter. The second-quarter trade gap was down from an imbalance of $ 35.2 billion in the first three months of the year. Both quarters represented improvements from a record deficit of $ 41.2 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. The 14.9 percent narrowing in the deficit represented its biggest decline since the fourth quarter of 1982, when the imbalance fell by 18.9 percent. The new figures confirmed an improvement that had already shown up in the department's monthly merchandise trade reports. The earlier figures showed a 12.8 percent drop in the deficit to $ 32.6 billion in the second quarter, compared to $ 37.4 billion in the first quarter. The drought's impact on consumers was reflected by a government report Tuesday that indicated grocery prices jumped by 1.4 percent during July, the biggest monthly increase since early 1984, although it showed little evidence of accelerating inflation elsewhere in the economy. Excluding food, overall retail prices rose just 0.3 percent for the month, slower than the pace of the first half of 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. The report reassured bond investors wary of inflationary pressures, sparking a mild rally in the credit markets. The price of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond, one indicator of inflationary speculation, rose about $ 5 for every $ 1,000 in face value, as its yield fell to 9.38 percent from 9.45 percent late Monday. Wall Street failed to follow the bond market, and finished little changed amid low trading volume. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 25.78 points on Monday to reach its lowest level in nearly three months, dipped another 0.89 point to close at 1,989.33. The government also reported that orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods plunged ny 7 percent in July, the biggest drop in four years, primarily due to huge declines in orders for cars and to decreased military purchases. The decline had been anticipated after durable-goods orders skyrocketed 8.7 percent in June, the biggest monthly increase in more than six years. In another report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, climbed 0.6 percent in July, the best showing since a 1.2 percent increase in April. The inflation report indicated that, including the drought-related price spikes for food _ which accounts for about one-sixth of people's spending _ consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in July, an annual rate of 5.2 percent. `` Despite all the talk about inflationary pressures, it's very difficult to find much in the way of evidence of it, even with this huge increase for food,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. The higher food prices from the four months of dry weather in the Farm Belt had been anticipated and, if anything, analysts were surprised that they were not bigger. The 1.4 percent gain in grocery store prices was led by a 9.6 percent jump in egg costs, a 7.4 percent boost for poultry and a 4.7 percent gain for fresh fruits and vegetables.

 Stock prices staged a broad advance in light dealings today after giving ground over the past three sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 0.89 on Tuesday and had fallen nearly 38 points since Friday, climbed 16.00 to 2,005.33 after 90 minutes of trading.

 Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a technical reversal of Tuesday's mostly lower pattern, analysts said. Soybeans led the advance after two days of sharp declines that saw the contract for September delivery of soybeans plunge a total of 64 cents to $ 8.07 a bushel, a 12-week low. `` There's a little bargain hunting down here,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, a research analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Chicago-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` A lot of people are saying the 64-cent fall was overdone.''

 The stock market rallied this morning, moving higher early in the session and then managing to hold on to most of the early gains. Trading continued at a sluggish pace. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 0.89 on Tuesday and fell nearly 38 points in the past three sessions, was up 13.16 at 2,002.49 at noontime. It had been up nearly 17 points earlier in the day. Advancing issues outpaced losers by a margin of 2 to 1 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 803 up, 390 down and 565 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume amounted to 59.85 million shares as of noon on Wall Street compared with 62.63 million shares at the same point on Tuesday.

He said some of the buying was by traders who had previously agreed to sell borrowed stocks in expectation that prices were going lower. Investors have generally shown little inclination to buy stocks because they are fearful that the recent pace of economic expansion is strong enough that inflation and interest rates are likely to pick up. On Tuesday, the government reported that consumer prices were up modestly in July while orders for durable goods tumbled. But while the reports sparked a mild rally in bond prices, stocks failed to follow through. Prices in the bond market were little changed today. Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON><PERSON> ' </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said today's stock rally may partly reflect a delayed reaction to bond price rise over the past few days, however.

 Stock prices managed to creep into positive territory Wednesday, as a strong start on Wall Street pulled <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equities higher. However, dealers said activity remained sparse, as many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of Thursday's release of British trade figures for July and the upcoming three-day holiday weekend in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 1.3 points, or 0.1 percent, higher at 1,819.2. `` We keep dancing around 1,815 to 1,820, but without much follow-through or direction we're not going to make any headway, one way or the other,'' said one equity trader. Volume was modest with 384.8 million shares changing hands, compared with 319.2 million shares traded Tuesday. Dealers said one large computer-generated program trade accounted for a substantial portion of Wednesday's volume. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average opened about 2 points better, and then quickly climbed almost 20 points higher before falling back a bit as the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> session drew to a close.

 Long after explorers charted their course by stars or compass, a computer software pioneer has literally mapped out a product and a business strategy that is guiding his company to success. The 3-year-old company is <ORGANIZATION> MapInfo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which sells a software package that allows the personal computer user to merge databases and digital maps of areas within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. With a couple of keystrokes, the user can place the cursor at a point on a map displayed on the computer screen and have access to volumes of information about that point. <ORGANIZATION> MapInfo </ORGANIZATION> can search a database for points within a boundary, determine latitude and longitude of a point or find an address. Users can focus in on a 52-foot span of a city block or zoom out to a 5,000-mile range. That may not sound like anything new, says <ORGANIZATION> MapInfo </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> with a smile, but his young company claims to be No. 1 in desktop mapping In fact, he says, there is n't even any competition _ yet. `` These kinds of capabilities have been available on minicomputers and mainframes before, but it's never been made so that the common person can use it or it's never been priced so that the common person can afford it,'' said <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON>, who developed the company with three other students of <ORGANIZATION> Rensselaer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. While some might view MapInfo's product as competition for mapping via larger computers, it can also complement those methods, says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, manager in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s geographic and mapping products department in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is on <ORGANIZATION> MapInfo </ORGANIZATION>'s list of customers, and is also a competitor. `` The market is not really a market where if you do PC stuff, you're going to influence mainframes. It really all has to work together,'' he said. <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> refused to say if <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, which now is involved in mapping using mainframes and minicomputers, is developing a program that would be comparable to <ORGANIZATION> MapInfo </ORGANIZATION>'s. So just who uses digital maps and databases on personal computers? Companies or individuals use MapInfo for sales and marketing, trend analysis, demographic analysis, dispatching and even planning of routes for optical fiber cables. Customers include police departments who want to map out crime scenes, real estate agents, city planners, cemetery planners, orange growers and scientists tracking insect populations or AIDS concentrations. `` Even if the job is really large ... and they've -LRB- clients -RRB- got their heart set on a larger system, we would recommend <ORGANIZATION> MapInfo </ORGANIZATION> to start out with and to train their people, if nothing else,'' said <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Talton </PERSON>, vice president of CAPS Consulting, which works with the growing market of geographical information systems. Based in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, CAPS Consulting deals primarily with urban planning departments and recommends <ORGANIZATION> MapInfo </ORGANIZATION> frequently because of its quality, speed with large databases, ease of use and price, he said. `` Smaller cities and smaller government entities can afford to have this in their offices,'' he said. <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said sales went from zero to millions within one year, but he refuses to disclose figures. Their customers, which are located in 18 countries, include the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. This spring, <ORGANIZATION> MapInfo </ORGANIZATION> won a $ 250,000 contract with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to provide mapping software to its recruiting command. The system will be used for sales and marketing applications to help the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> better allocate recruiting personnel. `` There's a potential -LRB- for <ORGANIZATION> MapInfo </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to be a $ 50 -LRB- million -RRB- to a $ 100 million dollar company down the road,'' <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> MapInfo </ORGANIZATION> came to be when <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> completed the design of an electronic map and tracking system for automobiles as part of a college project. By the time <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> graduated in 1985, he and three other engineers and programmers had joined with business consultant <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> and obtained financial backing to launch the firm. The first digital mapping system was unveiled in 1987, the current version in January 1988. The software package costs $ 750 and digital maps for 300 metropolitan areas in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> range in price up to $ 2,000. The programs provide names of streets, rivers and bridges, as well as address number ranges for every block and side of a street. Buyers can also use the software with their own maps. Because the firm has met with success so far and has been written about in technical magazines, the threat of competition always looms. `` We always feel like we're running against ghosts,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, who is <ORGANIZATION> MapInfo </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer. An offshoot of the firm called <ORGANIZATION> Map </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> was launched this spring, which uses the MapInfo software and adapts it to the markets for newspaper and television. And at <ORGANIZATION> MapInfo </ORGANIZATION>, the development staff is always working on the next version of the mapping system. `` This company actually has the chance to be one of the top 10 software companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, because the market is just exploding at this point in time,'' <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> contended.

<HEAD>NYSE Chairman Calls For Common Rules On Insider Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rules against insider trading are so inconsistent in stock markets worldwide that surveillance officials are having trouble controlling the illegal practice, the head of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock market, called for establishing common definitions of insider trading on international exchanges in an attempt to combat unscrupulous traders and reassure the investing public that the markets are n't rigged. `` Everybody comes from different culture and corporate background,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` But the users of those markets have to see those markets are fair and that they are not disadvantaged to work in them.'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> urged each market to spell out its own definition of what insider trading is and then work together to set up common rules. `` Within the market place, everybody talks the same language,'' he said. `` But if it is perceived by any major participant that the market is unfair, there will be a lack of use of the market and that will be detrimental to everybody.'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> criticized the Japanese approach to insider trading as `` taking a narrow interpretation.'' But he declined to assess recent measures taken by Japanese securities authorities, saying, `` Their need are different from our needs.'' Currently several cases of what Western finance experts charge are insider trading deals _ securities transactions based on information not available to the public _ are raising questions in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s financial community about the ethics of Japanese stock deals. In the most prominent case, several politicians' aids and senior journalists admitted to buying stock of a real estate concern before the issues were made public, and making huge profits by selling the shares after they were listed. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> also announced the formation of a new committee to counsel the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> board of directors on Japanese business and financial matters. The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will be chaired by ex-Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Saburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Okita </PERSON> and vice-chaired by <PERSON> Akio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s corporate community has become an important partner in worldwide commerce, and at the same time, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is opening the doors of its financial community to western participants,'' he said. The committee is the latest of 11 advisory bodies the exchange has established. A <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was formed in 1985. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> credited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s efforts to open its financial market to foreign investors and companies. `` When I came here three years ago, what everyone was talking about was more market access,'' he said. `` And today, more and more what you hear about are things you hear about in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> _ how to make money, how the market is growing, what new instruments are coming into the market.'' He said it is still difficult for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities firms to penetrate the Japanese market, but it is equally difficult for Japanese to break into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. `` Clearly, it is not easy to penetrate the national market which was established by domestic insitutions over a period of time,'' he said. `` But I ... expect to see continuing opening up of the -LRB- Japanese -RRB- market because I think it is a Japanese interest to do so.''

<HEAD>Dollar, Pound End Lower In Choppy European Trading</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: An AMs version planned by 5:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar finished lower against most major foreign currencies in thin, choppy European trading Wednesday, pushed down by central bank intervention. Gold prices rose. Currency dealers said the dollar was pushed down by several spurts of intervention from the central banks of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, but it found strong buying interest at about 1.8885 West German marks. The intervention involved the central banks of fewer countries than on previous days, dealers said. But they said the central banks that did intervene made it clear that they did n't want the dollar above 1.90 marks. The pound also slumped, on fears of a deterioration in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s trade deficit In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound fell to $ 1.6788 from $ 1.6795 late Tuesday. It slumped to 3.18 marks from 3.20 marks. Dealers say they were increasingly worried that Thursday's release of British trade figures would show a widening from June's 1 billion-pound, or $ 1.68 billion, Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday: 1.8915 West German marks, down from 1.9060; 1.5950 Swiss francs, down from 1.6055; 6.4250 French francs, down from 6.4635; 2.1370 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1440; 1,403.50 Italian lire, down from 1,407.50; and 1.2321 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2303. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.37 yen to a closing 134.30 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 134.25 yen. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 433.90 a troy ounce, compared with late Tuesday's $ 432.75. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 433.50 an ounce, compared with $ 433 late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 59 cents to close at a bid $ 434 an ounce. Silver bullion prices rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 6.81 a troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $ 6.74.

<HEAD>Japan, South Korea Express Regrets Over U.S. Trade Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> expressed regrets Wednesday over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade bill that was signed Tuesday by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying it has protectionist provisions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the trade bill a step toward opening worldwide markets to American products, but expressed displeasure with some of the provisions. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he regretted the trade bill but hopes the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will implement the law `` in a manner to curb trade protectionism.'' He said previously that he would ask <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto the package when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed it earlier this month. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will promote the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of trade talks in order to curb protectionist pressures in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Some of the nations that say the bill is protectionist are themselves accused of being protectionist by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Among other measures, the bill transfers authority from the president to the trade representative to decide on measures to be taken against what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers unfair trade practices. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade bill of having `` all the protectionist elements which aroused so much concern and protest from <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and many other trading nations.'' `` We are particularly concerned with the likely counter-reactions from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners,'' the statement said, adding the legislation would encourage enactment of similar laws or retaliation. The South Korean <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> urged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration to ensure `` the law be implemented in such a way as not to adversely affect the smooth growth of the Korea-U.S. trade relationship.'' The signing Tuesday climaxed months of negotiations between the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed a previous measure because it contained a provision requiring a 60-day notice to employees of plant closings and layoffs. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the advance-notice provision as a separate bill, and it became law. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' record $ 171 billion trade deficit in 1987 was a key reason behind congressional action to try to improve the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standing in the global marketplace. Of the overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit last year, up from $ 156.2 billion in 1986, the shortfall with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was again the largest at a record $ 59.8 billion, up from $ 58.6 billion in 1986 and $ 49.7 billion in 1985. The deficit with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was $ 19.0 billion, up from $ 7.1 billion in 1986, and the shortfall with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was $ 9.9 billion, up from $ 7.1 billion in 1986. Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> said, `` I urge the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, in enforcing this law, to maintain its policy of protecting free trade and never to give way to the pressure of protectionists.''

<TEXT>
 As <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> prepares to rebuild from its war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, companies based in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are already jostling for what could be some very big business. South Korean businessmen are pouring into <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s capital in hopes of winning orders for major construction projects. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is also expected to be active in seeking business. At a recent <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> trade fair, 26 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies had display stands. And several Western European companies are already at work on major construction projects. Peace negotiations aimed at ending the fighting between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> open in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Thursday, five days after a U.N.-sponsored truce took effect in the 8-year-old conflict. `` The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> have been showing vigor and determination to have the lion's share in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s reconstruction effort,'' said a diplomat in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officials have said that they would look favorably on companies and countries that maintained business with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during the Gulf war, and which agreed to defer payments and reschedule debts. `` The Koreans have maintained business with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during the hard times, and deferred major loans until the war came to an end. They expect the Iraqis to reward them for their loyalty,'' he said. Several Western European companies have also continued to do business with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Paterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Candy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> is helping build a $ 1 billion irrigation project west of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, and a West German-Italian consortium is building the $ 1.7 billion <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> dam on the <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Saipem </ORGANIZATION> group has won a $ 1.4 billion contract to build an oil pipeline from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. When the war started, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was investing its billions of oil dollars in an ambitious development plan that included steel, petrochemical, fertilizer and automobile plants and massive water, road and housing projects. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has refused to provide figures on its losses in the war, either human or economic. But foreign estimates put the cost of just rebuilding the country's war-damaged transport facilities, oil installations, housing, factories, schools and hospitals at $ 30 billion. Damage to oil installations alone from Iranian bombing and shelling attacks has amounted to $ 8 billion, according to an estimate by <PERSON> Kiyotaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsuji </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. Steel and oil giant <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plans to sell an idle steel plant in <LOCATION> Baytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which wants to dismantle the plant and ship it home to build pipes for irrigation and oil production. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reportedly has offered Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> $ 100 million for the plant, but some <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressmen oppose the sale. In recent years, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has changed some of his economic policies, pushing privatization rather than the socialist central planning and government control that prevailed before the war. Last week, for example, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government said the country's seven major hotels, its biggest restaurants and other tourist facilities will be sold off or leased to the private sector South Korean companies were the primary contractors for many of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s suspended projects, including power plants, oil refineries, highways, pipelines and ports. Immediately after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to a cease-fire, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s major construction companies hastily dispatched their chief executives to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. One ghost from the war hanging around the reconstruction banquet is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s foreign debt, estimated at $ 60 billion. But since <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has oil reserves second only to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s, foreign businessmen seem ready to overlook this. Diplomats said they expect the Iraqis to continue to defer some of their debts by seeking new credits as they repay old ones. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have already rescheduled billions of dollars in loans to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s second-largest arms supplier after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, has extended about $ 5 billion in credit for weapons purchases. A South Korean businessman expressed confidence in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s postwar economy `` Assuming oil prices hold steady, revenues from oil are projected to reach around $ 14 billion this year,'' he said, speaking on condition he not be identified. `` Looking further ahead, the country's revenues could be $ 20 billion in early 1990,'' he said. Some Japanese companies have begun lobbying for major post-war contracts, raising the prospect of tough competition between the two <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> powers at the same time that Western European and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are becoming more active in the Iraqi contest. The South Korean companies left their offices in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> open during the war and kept their equipment in the country, hoping to return and do business there. `` We have always been able to distinguish between wartime <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> ... and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of the next century, with its great economic potential,'' the South Korean businessman said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are seeking a big slice of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s reconstruction pie. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration restored financing to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Export-Import </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> last year, after withdrawing it when <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> stopped debt repayments. U.S.-Iraqi trade, estimated last year at more than $ 700 million, also is expected to swell in the wake of the cease-fire.

 Stock prices were broadly higher this afternoon, as the market extended the morning's gains in light volume. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 0.89 on Tuesday and fell nearly 38 points in the past three sessions, was up 20.98 at 2,010.31 with two hours left in the session.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Prosecution Challenge to Posner's Probation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MILT SOSIN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge Wednesday rejected a prosecution complaint that probation for millionaire and convicted tax evader <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> gives the impression that the rich can buy their freedom while the poor go to prison. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> pleaded no contest in February to overvaluing land he donated to a college. He received five years probation and a fine of $ 4 million after agreeing to donate an additional $ 3 million to a program for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s homeless. Then-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> challenged the sentence in April, arguing that it would `` only emphasize that the rich can trade money for liberty while the poor can not.'' But in a ruling released Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON>, who had sentenced <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, rejected the prosecution's arguments He emphasized that under the probation requirement, the industrialist must devote 20 hours a week to the homeless project. `` <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> may have avoided prison, but his service obligations will be so personally demanding and time-consuming that he is by no stretch of the imagination a ` free man,''' the judge wrote. In 1985 <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, who runs a 40-company empire valued at $ 4 billion, was rated the nation's highest-paid executive with an annual salary of $ 12.7 million. The judge said he conservatively calculated that <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s time was worth $ 3,200 an hour. `` As one of the highest-paid individuals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, this time commitment alone over five years is worth more than $ 16 million,'' <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> wrote. `` There is no plausible punishment more reasonably related to <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> and his crime than to have him roll up his sleeves and dedicate a substantial part of his life to furthering a vital charitable cause,'' said the judge. The prosecution had specifically attacked the requirement that <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> donate $ 3 million to the homeless project, saying that portion of the sentence was illegal. But <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> had agreed to the donation no matter what decision was made on the prosecution challenge, and called the issue moot. In recent months <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> has been discussing plans for the homeless project with a court-approved committee that will oversee the effort. He has said he envisions a pilot project aimed at providing homes, perhaps taking advantage of federal subsidies. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> was convicted on 10 tax fraud counts for inflating the value of land donated to <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> when writing the charitable gift off on his income tax return. With the time he must spend on the homeless project, <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> noted, `` charity will no longer merely mean a tax writeoff to <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will continue to appeal a ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Takeovers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION>, which decided the brewer violated the panel's code of conduct during its 1986 takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. If the ruling is upheld, <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> may be required to pay as much as 100 million pounds, or about $ 168 million, to former shareholders of Distillers, maker of <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>'s gin and <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> Scotch whiskey. The ruling already has been upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the Court of Appeal. <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> said it now plans to ask the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s final court of appeal, to consider the regulatory body's ruling The panel ruled last September that a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION> Pipetec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, acted in concert with <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> when it bought <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> shares during the final stages of its $ 4.3 billion takeover battle. The purchase gave <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> more than 15 pecent of Distillers' shares Under panel rules, a 15-percent holding would have forced <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> to make a cash offer to <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> shareholders at least equal to the maximum price it paid for <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> shares over the previous 12 months. <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> has admitted that its former management arranged for third parties to buy <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> shares during the takeover, apparently to boost the share price and make <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>' cash-and-stock offer more attractive than a rival bid Seven men, including former <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, have been charged with criminal offenses in the case.

 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday offered <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> $ 1.41 billion in new credits to add to the $ 120.2 billion the nation is expected to owe at the end of the year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks hold about $ 20 billion of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s debt, which is the biggest in the Third World. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government holds the biggest block of shares in the international fund, to which <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> already owes $ 3.08 billion. The fund is owned by 151 countries. The government of Brazilian President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, hard hit by inflation, may draw installments of the fund's `` standby arrangement'' _ as the new loan is called _ through Feb. 28, 1990. Under the fund's usual practice, reviews are held after each installment to decide if the borrower has been performing as agreed and whether the next installment can be drawn. The fund's credits go along with $ 5.2 billion being offered to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> by banks worldwide to which it already owes about $ 68 billion. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has 700 creditor banks, which have pledged 95 percent of the additional loans promised. Disbursal of such loans is often withheld if the fund's disbursements are stopped. Interest on old debt already costs <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> $ 10.2 billion to $ 10.4 billion a year. Much of the interest owed to banks was not paid last year, but some payments have now resumed. The principal has not been reduced in recent years, as is generally the case with Third World debt, which is expected to reach a total of more than $ 1.2 trillion by the end of the year. The fund said <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has pledged to cut the government's deficit in 1988 to 4 percent of the country's gross national product and to cut it again in 1989. The deficit amounted to 5.5 percent of GNP in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> calculates that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s total production in 1986 was worth about $ 250 billion, or $ 1,810 for each citizen. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is promising to cut inflation, according to the fund's announcement Figures from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> say inflation reached a record 24.04 percent for the month of July and may run close to 1,000 percent for the year. By the fund's calculations, consumer prices have been rising at an annual rate of about 500 percent in the first four months of the year. The Brazilian government's program, as outlined by the fund, aims to shrink differences of income among its people, to increase savings, improve the country's surplus in world trade, reduce barriers to imports, increase efficiency, reduce government regulation, privatize state-owned industry and reform the financial system. `` These reforms are expected to ... contribute to foster overall economic growth,'' the fund said. Despite its economic problems <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> already has one of the best records for growth in the Western Hemisphere: 4.3 percent annually for each citizen over the years 1965 to 1986, according to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Growth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as only 1.6 percent over the same period, but Americans earn almost $ 10 for every dollar the average Brazilian makes.

<HEAD>Builder Wants Royalty On Handcrafted House Priced At $685,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Home builder <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garey </PERSON> thinks of his work as art, so he's refusing to sell one of his latest creations unless the buyer agrees to pay a 1 percent royalty. The unprecedented proposal is sending new shudders through the already trembling <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> realty market, where the median price for a single-family home has jumped 21.2 percent in the past year to more than $ 170,000. The home on which <PERSON> Garey </PERSON> wants a royalty is priced at $ 685,000. <PERSON> Garey </PERSON> is requesting the 1 percent cut for him or his heirs each time the house is sold. `` Every time a realtor spends two weeks selling a house, he gets 6 percent,'' said <PERSON> Garey </PERSON>. `` I do n't see why the person who designed and built it should n't get 1 percent.'' But real estate attorney <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishbach </PERSON> said the housing market could be set reeling if the royalty idea catches on. `` This has a huge potential to snarl up real estate transactions,'' he said. Unusual deed restrictions can make it hard for title companies to provide clear title for properties, he explained. `` It's the kind of thing that only happens in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' quipped <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, the Chicago-based chief counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. He said it's the first time he's heard of an artist's royalty in real estate If builder royalties should become commonplace, many believe it could only add new fuel to the blazing <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> realty market. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that the median price of an existing home rose during July to $ 172,347 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ $ 208,110 in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. Nevertheless, the number of home sales has risen 8.2 percent in the past year. <PERSON> Garey </PERSON>'s homes are priced about 20 percent higher than homes of comparable size in the area, but the builder still considers them a bargain. He says the royalty has nothing to do with money. `` It's pure ego,'' <PERSON> Garey </PERSON> said. `` I want something that shows my 17-year-old son that I was here ... something to be seen for my effort.'' <PERSON> Garey </PERSON> has admired <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>'s distinctive houses since he was a 19-year-old history and literature student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. One day about 25 years ago he rode his motorcycle through the hills and discovered a home under construction by local designer-builder <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON>. That night, he recalls, he dreamed about the house and later went to <LOCATION> Boynton </LOCATION> and said he wanted to buy it, even though he did n't have any money. `` I'm not going to sell it, but I'll teach you to build your own,'' <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON> replied. Since then, <PERSON> Garey </PERSON> has designed and handcrafted 11 homes. He says he has hoisted every hand-polished beam and hammered every board, usually with the help of just one assistant. He also says he has done the wiring, set the tile, caulked the windows and installed the plumbing. `` I love it,'' he said. `` It's like sculpting on a large scale.'' A brochure describes the home for which <PERSON> Garey </PERSON> wants a royalty as `` timeless architecture ... not a style but an attitude ... a living sculpture of form and feeling, light and view, redwood and mahogany.'' So far, there has been no taker for the four-bedroom house in the <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> hills with a spectacular view of the Golden Gate Bridge.

 The corn market led grain and soybean futures to a sharply higher close Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> partly on fears of a freeze this weekend in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Analysts were skeptical of the frost talk, which helped drive corn futures prices up the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel. `` I find it hard to believe with all the hot weather we've had,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst with G.H <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based division of the British-owned trading company <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Magazine Says Mars Candy Bar Family Richest in America</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Mars candy-bar clan is worth $ 12.5 billion, surpassing the <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> publishing dynasty as the richest family in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, Fortune magazine reports. If Fortune's estimate is correct, the worth of the Marses could buy about 25 billion regular-size Snickers bars, which if laid end to end would circle the planet Mars nearly 32 times. The magazine's calculation is more than any previous estimate of the wealth of the secretive family, which shuns publicity about itself and its candy bar company, maker of <ORGANIZATION> Snickers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ms. `` Mars's assets are often underestimated because the company is as loose with information as its <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, neighbor, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Fortune </PERSON> said Wednesday in an advance press release about its 1988 Billionaires List, to be carried in the Sept. 12 issue available on newsstands next Monday. The magazine said it based the estimate of the Marses' wealth on what comparable food concerns have sold for recently. `` Thus, <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Mars </PERSON> and his three children, <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>, overtake the <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> publishing magnates as the richest Americans,'' <PERSON> Fortune </PERSON> said. Still, the Marses rank No. 3 on Fortune's worldwide list. The richest remains the Sultan of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, whose oil wealth makes him worth $ 25 billion. Next is King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and family, worth $ 18 billion. Fourth is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> with $ 8.7 billion; next is the <ORGANIZATION> Newhouses </ORGANIZATION>, whose communications holdings are worth $ 8 billion; in sixth place is retail king <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> stores, and family, worth $ 7.4 billion; seventh is <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> family, with $ 6.3 billion in assets that range from swank <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate to interests in railroads and utilities.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it would take an after-tax charge of about $ 25 million in its fiscal fourth quarter to cover the cost of settling a lawsuit brought by two former executives.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar sank Wednesday with a slight push from a few central banks after having resisted concerted official efforts to lower it in previous sessions. Gold prices rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 434.60 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 431.85 an ounce late Tuesday. Traders said the market was influenced by an article in Wednesday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that quoted an unnamed senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official as saying the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration believes a further rise of the dollar could be troublesome. Also, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> reportedly said the dollar's recent rise against the West German mark was `` inexplicable.'' Further undermining the dollar was a sale of hundreds of millions of British pounds for West German marks, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, a senior trader for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>. He said the trade was done by selling sterling for dollars and then selling dollars for marks. The result was to lower the dollar against the mark, starting a slide. The dollar's fall was fairly steady. Most times when the dollar is falling it stages periodic rallies, or bounces, but Wednesday `` it was bouncing like a dead cat,'' <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said. Currency dealers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> said there were spurts of intervention by the central banks of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound fell to $ 1.6788 from $ 1.6795 late Tuesday, influenced by fears that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would report a bigger trade deficit Thursday. But later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it rose to $ 1.6869 from $ 1.6740 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.37 yen to a closing 134.30 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 134.25 yen. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 133.83 yen from 134.11 yen. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday: 1.8820 West German marks, down from 1.9128; 1.5855 Swiss francs, down from 1.6102; 1.2339 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2308; 6.3960 French francs, down from 6.4895; and 1,396.50 Italian lire, down from 1,415.75. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday: 1.8915 West German marks, down from 1.9060; 1.5950 Swiss francs, down from 1.6055; 6.4250 French francs, down from 6.4635; 2.1370 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1440; 1,403.50 Italian lire, down from 1,407.50; and 1.2321 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2303. Gold prices rose late in the trading day in reaction to the weakness of gold. Gold's dollar price becomes cheaper for foreign investors when the dollar's exchange rate falls. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 59 cents a troy ounce to close at a bid $ 434 an ounce. Later, gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 433.90 a troy ounce, compared with late Tuesday's $ 432.75. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 433.50 an ounce, compared with $ 433 late Tuesday. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $ 434.90 a troy ounce from $ 432.20 late Tuesday. Silver bullion prices rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 6.81 a troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $ 6.74.

<TEXT>
 The aluminum industry's bid for early labor contract settlements failed Wednesday in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, where bargaining ended in disagreement over economic issues. Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> Aluminum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the industry leader, and <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, opened talks Aug. 9 with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers. About 21,000 members of the two unions will continue working under two-year contracts that do n't expire until May 1989. Since the two sides reached an impasse in the early talks they planned to reopen the bargaining nearer the expiration date. `` The problem was that what they came up with on profit sharing was very inadequate,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> offered to give union members a share of only those profits that exceeded 6 percent of the value of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets, and <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> offered a share of those profits exceeding 10 percent of shareholders' equity, he said. Under those proposals, `` In 1987, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' biggest profit year, they would have shared slightly more than $ 600 per worker, and <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> would have shared nothing,'' <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> said. Combined with other provisions, the companies' offers would have represented hourly wage increases projected at 37 cents, he said. `` Our members gave up about 95 cents an hour in the current contract,'' <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> said. `` Certainly we want our members to recoup what they had given up since the companies are tremendously profitable.'' `` We offered both unions a four-year agreement featuring a profit-sharing plan, an immediate insurance option and increased pension benefits,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> reported 1987 profits of $ 200 million on sales of $ 7.77 billion and 1988 first-half profits of $ 416.3 million on sales of $ 4.59 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> reported 1987 net earnings of $ 219.5 million on sales of $ 4.32 billion and 1988 first-half profits of $ 204.9 million on sales of $ 2.65 billion. The Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> represents about 4,000 Reynolds employees at 21 locations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and about 6,000 <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> employees at nine locations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ABGW </ORGANIZATION> represents about 4,000 Reynolds workers and about 7,000 <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> workers. The two unions negotiate side-by-side on separate contracts.

 The nation's automakers Wednesday reported a 13.2 percent dip in their mid-August sales of cars and trucks, but analysts attributed much of the drop to the curtailment of buyer incentives. `` Incentives were just coming in last year and there are no new incentive programs right now,'' said analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brunham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` So Americans are buying the things.'' The latest sales report, covering the Aug. 11-20 period, is compared with daily sales from the same period a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market slipped during the period to 46.4 percent, down from 54.3 percent during the same period last year. Meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> boosted its share from 28.6 percent to 31.6 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> increased its piece of the industry's pie from 11.2 percent during mid-August 1987 to 13.6 percent during the same period this year. `` Chrysler and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> seem to be eating <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s lunch,'' <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said. Overall, car makers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reported selling 298,580 cars and trucks during the nine selling days of this year, compared with 343,845 vehicles bought during the same period last year, when there also were nine selling days. For the month so far, car and truck sales were off 10 percent, from 607,125 in 1987 to 578,643 this year. Domestic and foreign automakers report sales for all of August in early September. Car makers offered some of their most attractive incentives last year. But this year, as inventories have shrunk, automakers have been less likely to offer special incentive plans. The car makers reported that for the year, sales of U.S.-made cars and trucks are up 8 percent, from 7,092,789 last year to 7,699,649. Each of the Big Three reported dips in car sales during mid-August, compared with the same period last year. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it sold 88,394 cars this year, down 30.3 percent from 126,887 during the incentive-bloated period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 10 percent drop in sales to 60,184 from 66,907 a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> showed the smallest decrease, dropping 0.8 percent from 26,200 cars in mid-August 1987 to 25,985 during the period this year. Meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it sold 9,259 cars during mid-August of this year compared with 7,563 cars in the same period last year _ a 22.4 percent increase. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>'s sales fell 4.5 percent during the period from 4,380 cars in mid-August 1987 to 4,182 in the same period this year <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported sales of 1,429 cars during the period this year compared with 1,188 last year, an increase of 20.3 percent.

<HEAD>Drought Concerns Turn To Fears Of Early Freeze In Futures Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Fears that frost could nip the Corn Belt as early as this weekend helped send corn and soybean futures prices sharply higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat and oats also advanced. On other markets, coffee, livestock, precious-metals and stock-index futures all rose while energy futures finished mostly lower. Meteorologists and grain analysts were skeptical of the Midwestern frost talk, which helped drive <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> corn futures prices up the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel. `` It's not going to happen,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, a meteorologist and commodities adviser for <ORGANIZATION> Freese-Notis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, both of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` There's going to be some 30s and 40s in parts of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region so it'll be cool for the weekend and then we'll be warming up again next week,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollingsworth </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> predicted lows in the 40s this weekend in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region `` but it does n't look like there's any indications right now for freezing temperatures in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>,'' she said The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> predicted above-normal temperatures and below-normal rainfall for the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> next week. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said early frosts _ early meaning September _ followed two of the last four summer droughts, in 1974 and 1983. He said the early freeze in 1974 wiped out a large part of the soybean crop but added that this year's crops were maturing at an above-average pace, so frost would have to occur no later than Sept. 20 to cause significant damage. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst with G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based division of the British-owned trading company <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, called the freeze talk `` crazy.'' `` I find it hard to believe with all the hot weather we've had,'' he said Crop futures also advanced on perceptions that rain was slowing the wheat harvest in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, possibly reducing the amount of wheat that will be harvested there, <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> said. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 7 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.90 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 4 cents to 10 cents higher with September at $ 2.83 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 6 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.54 a bushel; soybeans were 12 cents to 27 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 8.31 -LCB- a bushel. Coffee futures surged on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on continuing concerns about dry weather in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's leading coffee producer and exporter. Coffee settled 2.91 cents to 5.46 cents higher with September at $ 1.2668 a pound. Unexpectedly strong demand for beef by retailers boosted cattle futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while strong cash hog markets helped to push the pork futures higher, analysts said. Live cattle settled unchanged to .83 cent higher with October at 71.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .33 cent to 1.05 cents higher with August at 81.75 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .40 cent higher with October at 40.47 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with August at 37.97 cents a pound. Precious metals rallied on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on mostly technical factors with the inflationary implications of the weaker dollar providing additional support, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnanel </PERSON>, director of futures trading for <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold settled $ 2.60 to $ 2.80 higher with October at $ 438.60 a troy ounce; silver was 5 cents to 5.4 cents higher with September at $ 6.79 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures advanced sharply in a technically motivated, late-afternoon surge on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 4.45 points higher at 261.75. Most energy futures slipped lower in lethargic trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 7 cents lower with October at $ 15.68 a barrel; heating oil was .22 cent to .39 cent lower with September at 43.75 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .25 cent lower to .33 cent higher with September at 47.51 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Quarterly Trade Deficit Shrinks, Stocks Up, Auto Sales Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s bulging trade deficit shrank 15 percent in the April-June quarter, the government said Wednesday in a report that strengthened <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign claims of economic achievement but did n't impress financial markets. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures showed the biggest quarterly improvement in more than five years, the dollar fell and bonds weakened. The stock market rallied, but trading was light and brokers attributed the gain to internal market influences that had little to do with the general economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the difference between what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> spends and sells abroad narrowed to a deficit of $ 29.9 billion in the second quarter, compared with a deficit of $ 35.2 billion in the first three months of 1988. Many economists regard the trade deficit as one of the most visible weaknesses in the economy, reflecting a relentless addiction to cheap imports and consequent difficulty for domestic companies trying to compete. Democrats have attempted to make the trade deficit an issue in the presidential campaign. But the improvement reported Wednesday suggested that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers are making strong gains in selling abroad. Some economists are predicting the trade deficit will drop by close to 25 percent for the year as a whole, marking the first annual improvement since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office. Republicans are hoping voters will focus on the improvement, which has already shown up in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly merchandise trade reports. But on Wall Street, the trade news was largely disregarded and the volume of trading remained low. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which had lost nearly 38 points over the previous three sessions, climbed 37.34 to close at 2,026.67 in what brokers described as a technical recovery. In foreign-exchange trading the dollar, which ordinarily would be expected to rally on improved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures, fell with a slight push from selling by a few central banks concerned about its recent rise. Traders said the currency market was influenced by an article in Wednesday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that quoted an unidentified senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official as saying the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration believes a further rise of the dollar could be troublesome. The dollar's decline was partly responsible for a poor showing in the bond market, where traders are sensitive to changes in the value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency because it directly affects the demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bonds by foreigners. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year bond fell about $ 2.50 per $ 1,000 in face amount and its yield, which moves inversely to price, rose to 9.39 percent from 9.37 percent late Tuesday. In other economic news, major automakers said mid-August sales of U.S.-made cars and trucks fell by 13.2 percent from the same period a year earlier, when sales were inflated by buyers taking advantage of dealer incentives. Companies making cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reported selling 298,580 cars and trucks during the Aug. 11-20 period this year, compared with 343,845 vehicles during the same period last year.

 <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> depositors have withdrawn about $ 300 million from the bank in recent weeks, and bank officials say the total could double. `` We're concerned _ but only because we would like to hang on to every deposit and customer we can,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s vice chairman <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> said Tuesday the withdrawals apparently reflect concern about the approaching end of a guarantee on deposits above $ 100,000 and the loss of additional deposit insurance that was available through the 40-bank system of <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>' predecessor, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In late July, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, acquired the former banks of First RepublicBank from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> agreed to invest up to $ 240 million for the 130 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banking locations of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION>, which was declared insolvent <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> initially will acquire a 20 percent stake in the bank but has an option to buy the rest from the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which promised to pump $ 4 billion into the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institution. `` I do n't know if it is possible to find a more sound institution anywhere,'' <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> said. Under terms of an agreement announced July 29, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> planned to withdraw the additional coverage for deposits above $ 100,000 that it installed in March to halt a run on First RepublicBank. The move does not affect the normal coverage of up to $ 100,000 offered to depositors at all federally insured institutions. <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> has alternative sources of funding _ including $ 3 billion in cash due from the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> as part of the transaction _ and faces no cash squeeze because of withdrawals. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> expects withdrawals to total as much as $ 600 million, about 10 percent of the $ 6 billion in the $ 100,000-plus accounts the bank maintains. <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> said depositors apparently had grown accustomed to the luxury of multibank insurance, a program through which customers could spread their deposits among several First RepublicBank institutions for additional <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> protection.

 A young computer whiz pleaded innocent Wednesday to 11 counts of felony larceny stemming from an alleged scheme to bilk six investors out of more than $ 500,000 to keep his business operating. <PERSON> Tex </PERSON> <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>, 24, faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison or a $ 25,000 fine and two years in jail on each charge if convicted. He was ordered held in lieu of $ 100,000 bail at the local jail. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>, who fled to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and attempted suicide with his mother after authorities and creditors moved in on his software firm <ORGANIZATION> Massdata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had been free on $ 1,000 bail during a two-month-long grand jury investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> approved the prosecution's recommendation that bail for <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> be increased because more indictments are expected in the case. Defense attorney <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he would ask during a bail review hearing Thursday that <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> be allowed to post $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 cash bail, which would be returned when he appeared for trial, instead of paying a surety bond as requested, which would not be returned. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office, said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> told the judge that <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> orchestrated `` a scheme of grand proportion'' to get people to invest in his company. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, head of the county's white collar crime unit, told the court <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> obtained loans by telling investors of a phantom family trust that he would use to pay back their inestments. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> told investors he would soon be eligible for funds from the trust left to him when his father died, he said. But investigators determined that <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>'s father is still alive and that the trust never amounted to more than $ 30,000. As Massdata slid into the red, <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> also allegedly used falsified documents to obtain bank loans. `` As part of the investigation, we determined that certain banks made loans based on papers presented by Mr. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> and the documents were allegedly fictitious or forgeries,'' <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON> said. `` This could stretch well beyond a million dollars,'' <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON> said. The grand jury is also looking into a $ 400,000 loan to <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Rockland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It appears that some of this money was being solicited to pay off other investors and also some bank notes,'' <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON> said. After <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, 50, fled <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> with creditors close behind, they were recaptured when an employee at the <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> reported a bloodied man wandering about the lobby. Police found <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>, who apparently had slashed his wrists. His mother and a bottle of non-prescription pills were found in their hotel room along with what appeared to be suicide notes, police said. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> bought his first computer at the age of 16 and, with the help of a mentor, rented office space to start his own software firm at the age of 20. He quickly surrounded himself with symbols of success, including a $ 220,000 <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION> condominium, a $ 32,000 BMW, and a 50-inch, $ 4,000 color TV.

 Stock prices surged Wednesday, bouncing back from levels last seen nearly three months ago in a rally that gathered momentum toward the finish. Trading volume, however, remained sluggish. Analysts said the market had been due for a rebound after this month's steady decline. But they said some encouraging news on the trade deficit and some bargain-hunting also contributed to the rally. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 0.89 on Tuesday and fell nearly 38 points in the past three sessions, climbed 37.34 points to close at 2,026.67, its biggest gain in nearly a month. Tuesday's close had left the market's best-known indicator at its lowest level since late May. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5-to-2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,089 issues up, 376 down and 498 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index rose 1.99 to 147.93. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 127.80 million shares, up from 119.54 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 151.27 million shares. Prices rose smartly for the first hour of trading, pulled back somewhat at midday and then extended their gains during the early afternoon. A 12-point spurt in the final hour of trading lifted the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to its biggest gain since a 46.40 rise on July 29. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said a combination of factors helped lift prices. He said this month's decline had soured the market's mood, and Wednesday's activity reflected `` a release from excessively consistent selling pressure.'' He said some investors may have found soem bargains at their depressed levels, while professional traders who had previously sold borrowed stocks, expecting prices to fall, decided to buy stocks. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said the stock rally may have also reflected a delayed reaction to Tuesday's government reports that consumer prices were up modestly in July while orders for durable goods tumbled. He said a new government report that the nation's trade deficit narrowed in the second quarter to $ 29.9 billion from an imbalance of $ 35.2 billion in the first three months of the year may also have provided some encouragement.

<HEAD>Court Approves $14 Million State Bailout for CM&amp;W Railroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal bankruptcy judge approved Wednesday a $ 14 million state bailout of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Heller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which are owed more than $ 100 million by the railroad, had opposed the rescue plan and sought to have the railroad shut down and its assets sold. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said in a written decision that the public interest required the railroad to continue to operate while its court-appointed trustee, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, works out a reorganization plan. `` The history of this railroad, the lenders' relationship to it, as well as the history of this case, demand this opportunity be given to the trustee if the public interest is not to be damned,'' <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> concluded. A spokeswoman for Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who put together the rescue package of grants and loans, applauded the decision to keep the <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W running. The creditors' attorney, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, was out of his office and not immediately available for comment. The railroad operates freight service over its entire 632-mile line between <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, with trackage rights extending the final 40 miles to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The 157-mile <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> route between <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> is used by 300,000 people annually, according to <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s office. The creditors had argued that even under the best of circumstances, the railroad's earnings would not come close to paying even the interest on the loans. CM & amp; W filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws on April 1, listing debts of $ 131.8 million and assets of $ 103.5 million. On July 29, <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> allowed <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W to accept $ 1 million of the proposed bailout to keep the railroad rolling through the completion of bankruptcy proceedings.

 There is no snap, crackle or pop to <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that B-vitamins in its Rice Krispies cereal provide pep, and the company has agreed to stop some of its advertising on the claim, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s attorney general said Wednesday. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, agreed Aug. 4 to stop all advertising in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that might mislead consumers about the health benefits of <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> <PERSON> Krispies </PERSON>, said state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>'s ads had claimed B-vitamins in Rice Krispies would give consumers added physical energy, vigor and power, and also asserted that fatigue was due to lack of these vitamins, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. Of the five B-vitamins contained in <LOCATION> Rice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Krispies </LOCATION>, three _ thiamin, <LOCATION> riboflavin </LOCATION> and niacin _ are known to help convert food into the type of energy needed by the body's cells, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. But there is no evidence that eating <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> <PERSON> Krispies </PERSON> has an effect on a person's energy level or feeling of well-being, he said. Studies have shown B-vitamins are readily available in the American diet and the majority of consumers who suffer from fatigue do not have any primary vitamin deficiency, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said in a statement. The attorney general obtained a formal `` assurance of discontinuance'' from <LOCATION> Kellogg </LOCATION> on Aug. 4, stating the company would not use any advertising or labeling that might lead consumers to believe B-vitamins added to <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> <PERSON> Krispies </PERSON> provide energy or relieve fatigue. The company admitted no liability but paid $ 10,000 toward the cost of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s investigation. A recording at <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> headquarters said the offices were closed Wednesday afternoon. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based public advocacy group, applauded the attorney general's efforts. <ORGANIZATION> CSPI </ORGANIZATION> brought the <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krispies </ORGANIZATION> health claim to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s attention last October.

 Offers of food, lodging, money and equipment continued to pour in Wednesday for a group of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers who have come to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to cut free hay for their drought-starved livestock. Meanwhile, organizers of the hay harvest said they've received calls from farmers and farmer groups in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> asking whether there was enough hay to feed their livestock as well. `` When we put out the notice, we did n't realize we were going to get such a tremendous response,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, director of information for the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's turned into a monumental task.'' Organizers of the hay harvest had worried there would n't be enough machinery to keep the Iowans busy, but offers of equipment began pouring into the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> office here Tuesday after a <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> official appealed on television for donations. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said the 64 Iowans would begin cutting hay on Thursday. The tired contingent Iowans arrived late Tuesday in two Greyhound buses donated by the transportation company for the 1,600-mile trip west. The men, women and teen-agers stayed overnight in rooms donated by three motels while <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> officials scouted about 4,500 acres of hay on pasture land placed in the government's Conservation Reserve Program. `` They really like what they're seeing,'' <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said. `` They're real pleased with the quality. The harvest could provide as much as 5,000 tons of hay. As of the first of this week, 76 percent of the hay crop in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was considered in poor condition by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. The Iowans, who plan to harvest, bail and ship for about 10 days, faced an Aug. 31 deadline to be off the reserve lands, which are under the control of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of us guys are just plain out of hay,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibbals </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Albia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, dairy farmer. `` The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> finally realized that and released the conservation reserve program lands.'' `` A lot of farmers are feeding their winter hay now,'' said <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Clarinda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` We usually do n't have to start -LRB- feeding -RRB- hay until December,'' added <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nunia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The Iowans will cut mostly grasses planted to prevent erosion on the reserve lands in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Latah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said. The hay is to be shipped back to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> on rail cars donated by the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern Railroad. Details were still being worked out on getting the hay to loading points and how it will be distributed when it arrives in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, who made the trip with his son, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON>. `` Hopefully, it will be dropped off at different spots,'' he said. Help for the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers came from fraternities at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which have offered to help harvest the hay, as did Future Farmers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other farm organizations, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said. Local restaurants and <ORGANIZATION> Granges </ORGANIZATION> have donated food to feed the field workers. Three banks in <LOCATION> Chariton </LOCATION>, about 45 miles south of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, put up cash for meals along the way. `` We have n't had to pay for anything yet,'' said <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Plank </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> official, estimated 200 boxcar loads of hay might be moved. The 4,500 acres could be expected to produce about 5,000 tons of hay, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> representative.

<HEAD>Investors Flock To `How To' Seminar on Thrift Investment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Financiers who have acquired troubled savings and loans told a capacity crowd of high-stakes investors Wednesday that the thrift industry is the investment `` bonanza'' of the next decade. More than 350 investors packed a conference room at the Fairmont Hotel to hear three nationally-known investors share their insight on how to make money buying into the beleaguered thrift industry. The daylong event was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION>, which hopes to lure investors with at least $ 1.5 million to spare into purchasing an ailing thrift. `` This will be your bonanza in the next decade _ lucky you,'' said <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Wespar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and former vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who is involved in several investment groups, including that of former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, appeared with investment banker <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLin </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The panel members are touting thrift investment because they say the competition will help their own businesses thrive and will improve the health of the whole industry. `` It's important to get this problem solved,'' said <PERSON> McLin </PERSON>. `` It's going to help the health of the entire industry. The sooner we get this thing fixed, the better it's going to be for everybody.'' The symposium also featured <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, who told listeners it was important to build up the industry's capital. `` We see -LRB- that -RRB- more and more of our attention should be given to the savings side,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. `` This country has got to do more about capital expansion if we want to continue to be competitive in this world.'' Thrifts are attractive investments in several aspects, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Unlike commercial banks, they are relatively easy to acquire, and there are few restrictions on what types of businesses may acquire an ailing thrift. Furthermore, they provide flexibility in investment powers, including broad powers for real-estate-related diversification, and are relatively easy to expand geographically, under federal laws allowing thrifts to branch in up to three states. In its latest acquisition, <ORGANIZATION> DP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the investment group headed by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, received federal approval Tuesday to acquire two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan institutions, including one that is insolvent. <ORGANIZATION> DP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> will raise up to $ 207.5 million in new capital to finance the acquisition and will get a federal assistance package totaling an estimated $ 565 million. <PERSON> McLin </PERSON>, whose limited partnership in May acquired <ORGANIZATION> Eureka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a troubled <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-area </LOCATION> thrift, said that to successfully take over a thrift an investor must have capital, good management and patience. `` We went into -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- with the willingness to invest $ 100 million _ and we had this in cash,'' he said, describing the <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION> acquisition. `` Conversely, if you're short on capital you'd better be very long on management. If you can go in and hit them with a proven track record, then it's possible without creating more of a joint venture framework,'' <PERSON> McLin </PERSON> said. Regulators are trying to sell 259 thrifts. A much larger number are technically insolvent but have not yet been taken over by federal officials. Last week in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a similar symposium attracted 600 people. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials have struggled to bring new capital into a thrift industry battered by bad loans, and see the interest in the symposiums as a sign that enthusiasm among investors may be growing.
