<HEAD>Heavy List of Amendments Slows Cooperative Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet Parliament on Wednesday put off voting on a progressive tax on people who work for private cooperatives, a key element of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. Such a move by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION>, which normally approves laws that have been put forward by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is very unusual. It may reflect concern about the contents of the law as well as a greater willingness to speak out under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of greater openness. The two chambers of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, met in separate sessions Wednesday to debate the law, scheduled to go into effect on July 1. The law also guarantees that cooperatives' property will not be seized by the government. Officials have said the aim of the progressive tax system on income earned by individuals who work in cooperatives is to get the cooperatives to invest in expanding their businesses rather than paying high salaries to workers. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has pushed cooperatives as a method of augmenting the state-run economy, which can not provide enough consumer goods and services. Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said in a speech to the opening session of the Supreme Soviet on Tuesday that the law was of `` immense social and political significance.'' He said the cooperative system `` in a short time can solve the most severe problems of perestroika -LRB- restructuring -RRB-, the demand of the population for goods and services.'' The cooperative law was to have been brought before a joint meeting of the Supreme Soviet on Wednesday, but officials at the meeting said 22 parliamentarians spoke about the law in meetings of the separate chambers Wednesday morning and that it was delayed while a commission looked at a series of proposed amendments. Officials at the Supreme Soviet meeting gave no details of the issues under debate, but the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said in a report that `` judging by the deputies' remarks, the new edition of the law has caused no objections of principle, while the amendments suggested are dictated by the desire to protect cooperatives from unfounded interference by local authorities.'' `` Groundless limitations are introduced in many places, often under the pretext of attempts to keep workers from leaving state enterprises,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Another reason behind the limitations is the bigoted idea that a cooperative is something to be looked down at.'' It said other problems facing cooperatives are the difficulty of obtaining supplies and the system of taxation. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said Tuesday that 6,000 cooperatives had been formed in the previous three months while the new law was being debated, while a total of 14,000 had been formed in 18 months. Restaurants are one of the most popular forms of cooperatives that have opened, and others have formed to make clothing, pump gas, do apartment repairs and provide other services.

<HEAD>Pete Wilson Eyes `Jinx'; McCarthy Hoping for Upset</HEAD>

 Democratic Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> is trailing in the polls and in fund raising, but he has one thing in his favor as he seeks to unseat Republican Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> this year _ `` The Jinx.'' For more than 30 years, no one has been re-elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> holds. Incumbents have died, stepped down or been defeated and descended into political oblivion. By contrast, Democrat <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> is flourishing in his fourth term holding down the state's other seat. `` Everybody talks about ` The Jinx,''' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> aide. `` But this is the year ` The Jinx' will be broken.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, not surprisingly, agrees: `` I think it's nonsense, a myth. We're going to prove it's not true.' The question of whether unlucky tradition will prevail may be the most exciting thing about the race, which is generally viewed as a showdown between two competent, conventional and largely colorless politicians. Both men are youthful-looking, clean-cut candidates, with reputations for personal honesty, and are perceived as moderates in their respective parties. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 57, a former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> supervisor who spent 14 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, including six years as <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> speaker, is expected to have no trouble defeating two little-known challengers in the June 7 Democratic primary: <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banuelos </PERSON>, a communications consultant from <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 54-year-old former mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, is unopposed for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. Since January 1987, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> has raised $ 4.7 million and spent about $ 4 million, while <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> has raised $ 2.4 million and spent $ 1.7 million. Both candidates say about 80 percent of their funds will be used to buy television advertising, a critical resource in this vast state which comprises 10 percent of the nation's population `` We've spent the recesses and the weekends campaigning,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said in an interview earlier this month, perched on the rear seat of a minivan zipping along Interstate 5. `` We've been out virtually every weekend ... but it's literally impossible for me to meet everybody.'' In one recent campaign swing, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> hit 13 cities in three days, targeting growers and business groups, while <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> has been on the road with a no-frills whistle-stop-style campaign from a motorhome. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said he has used the lieutenant governor's position to push legislation for health care for the elderly, nursing home improvements and child care programs. `` I think the elderly see me as their No. 1 champion. This is a very significant area of strength for me. This is something everyone concedes. `` But I do n't exaggerate the power inherent in the lieutenant governor's office,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> added. `` I received far more media attention when I was Assembly speaker.'' The most recent statewide survey of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters, a May 11 poll by the Gallup Organization, showed <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> with a 21-point lead over <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 51 percent to 30 percent, with 19 percent undecided. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, however, dismisses the polls, contending they largely reflect <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s television advertising campaign. Since those polls, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> received more bad news when a phalanx of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> film moguls, eight powerful studio chiefs, endorsed <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The studio bosses included several prominent Democrats. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> belittled the significance of the May 2 endorsements, saying that such stars <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> remained loyal to him. At issue is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat that has traded hands continuously since the 1950s. Moderate Democrat <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> <PERSON> Engle </PERSON>, who won the seat in 1958, died in office, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s former press secretary, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON>, was appointed to complete his term. <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> lost his 1964 election bid to Hollywood song-and-dance man <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a conservative Republican who in turn was defeated in 1970 by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunney </PERSON>, a Democrat and the son of boxer <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunney </PERSON>. In 1976, <PERSON> Tunney </PERSON> was defeated by former <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President S.I. <PERSON> Hayakawa </PERSON>, an acid-tongued, articulate semanticist known for his hard-line approach to student protesters. In 1982, faced with week standings in the polls, <PERSON> Hayakawa </PERSON> retired and was succeeded by <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> racked up another win in the Nielsens thanks to two ratings `` hulks'' _ one <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrigno </PERSON> and the other <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>. `` The Incredible Hulk Returns,'' a reunion movie starring <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bixby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferrigno </PERSON> as, respectively, a professor and his violent alter ego, ranked fourth in the weekly Nielsens with a rating of 20.2 and a 33 share. Hope's special celebration of 50 years of association with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> finished in sixth with an 19.0 and 31. And <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> may have solved its Wednesday night ratings with an `` Unsolved Mysteries'' special that was also in the top 10 in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings, at ninth, and is due to become a regular weekly fixture in the fall. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Baby M'' was no match for `` Hulk'' in a three-way made-for-TV movie battle on Sunday. Part one of the two-parter starring <PERSON> JoBeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> had a 15.0 rating and 24 share and ranked 17th for the week. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> came in third with `` My Father, My Son,'' starring <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Malden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON> as Adm. <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> and his son.

CBS' 10.7 was its lowest weekly rating this season. Last week was part of the important May sweeps, one of the four months a year when television ratings companies measure viewership in local markets. But with only a few days to go, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was second to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in sweeps competition. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s average since the beginning of the season stands at 15.8. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has 13.5 and CBS 13.2. The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The top 10-rated shows of the week were: `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` A Different World'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Incredible Hulk Returns'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Night Court'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>'s Birthday'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` 60 Minutes'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` Unsolved Mysteries'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>,'' and `` The American Comedy Awards'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>.

For the week that ended Friday, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' was first for the fourth week in a row, finishing with an average rating of 9.5 and a 20 share. The `` CBS Evening News'' had a 9.2 and a 19 share. `` NBC Nightly News'' had an 8.8 and 19 share.

 An ancient road traveled by the likes of <PERSON> Genghis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Babur </PERSON> has become an active artery of commerce today between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. More than 2,000 years ago, silk and spices made their way out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on the route, while gold, silver and wool made their way in. The commerce today is considerably more diverse, if not as exotic. As many as 80 Pakistani merchants travel the road into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> each day in battered buses to buy silk, porcelain and pearls, and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> businessmen head in the opposite direction toward the <LOCATION> Khunjerab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> on the border as part of a barter arrangement between the two countries. The barter enables the Chinese to trade hydroelectric equipment, farm tools, textiles, quilts and porcelain for Pakistani cigarettes, medical herbs, dried fruits, shoes and razor blades. The volume of official barter has increased to the equivalent of $ 3 million in the past year, compared to $ 300,000 in 1986, according to <PERSON> Sadeq </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, sales officer of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s Northern Areas Traders Cooperatives. The road also is being traveled more and more by tourists. From <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s border post of Sost the road follows the <LOCATION> Hunza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, then runs along the icy <LOCATION> Khunjerab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, crossing numerous glaciers. As it climbs to the <LOCATION> Khunjerab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, it goes through a series of narrow chasms and steep declines. At <LOCATION> Tashkargan </LOCATION>, the first Chinese town across the border, workmen are building hotels and inns to accommodate the growing number of travelers passing through. <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tahsin </PERSON>, manager of the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Pamir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tashkargan </LOCATION>, said the new hotels will be more modern and better equipped. `` Business is getting better,'' he said. `` So we have to add a couple of wings to our hotel.'' <PERSON> Tahsin </PERSON> is one of about 12,000 people in <LOCATION> Tashkargan </LOCATION> who are <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem Tajiks, the tribe dominant in the area. They are distinguishable by their sharp features and their women by their colorful costume. Across the border in <LOCATION> Sost </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pakistanis </PERSON> also are building to meet the growing flow of tourists. <PERSON> Assif </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, a Pakistani government tourist official, said big tour groups now travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> four times a month compared to twice a month a year ago. But it's a tough road to travel, says <PERSON> Amanollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mogul </PERSON>, the bus driver who makes the journey about once a day back and forth to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Khunjerab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, he said, makes him dizzy.

 Horticulturists from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, garden club members from Biggleswade and window-box farmers from the inner city clutched their coveted tickets Tuesday for the <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Show </ORGANIZATION>, which has sprouted along the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> this week like a promise of summer. On the sun-dappled lawns beside the red-brick <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> are displayed the very best roses, dahlias, pansies and delphiniums that this nation of gardeners can produce. So great are the crowds at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most prestigious annual garden extravaganza that the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horticultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> limited ticket sales for the four-day trade show to 45,000 per day _ at $ 26 each _ and may have to move to a larger site next year. Last year, 243,000 people crowded onto the 19-acre site, most of them milling under the 3 -LCB- - acre marquee that covers the choicest displays Members of the 84-year-old society, which has sponsored the <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> show since 1913, have their own viewing days, as does Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. Membership in the society is 110,000 and growing, said assistant secretary <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. Most are Britons, but there are many American members and a Japanese branch has just begun. More leisure time and income have boosted the growth of gardening, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` But the most important thing is there are no social barriers,'' he said. `` At the show, you'll see dowagers and dustmen -LRB- garbage collectors -RRB- talking about the same thing.'' Gardening in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is the closest thing to a universal interest, not counting curiosity about the royal family. Five weekly TV and radio programs are devoted to gardening, and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 13-part series, `` The Victorian Kitchen Garden,'' was such a hit last year that it's already being repeated. It is difficult to imagine another country where a half hour of prime time television would be devoted to the growing of tomatoes or methods of repelling slugs; where a person alarmed by clematis wilt can telephone an expert on TV and get immediate help; or where three wry horticulturists could become national celebrities through their radio question-and-answer show. Some city-dwellers nurturing pots of herbs on the windowsill or geraniums on the roof terrace dream of the gardening opportunities in the countryside. But even in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, most people have access to a bit of grass and soil and just about all of them plant something in it. Because most of central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s dwellings are rowhouses, there are thousands of narrow back gardens, neatly fenced and stretching to meet an identical row of gardens from the houses on the next street. The English rose, honeysuckle, ivy, jasmine and purple wisteria climb the fences and camouflage the garden sheds. Lilacs, plum trees, lavender and foxgloves fill the borders _ often leaving just enough grass to warrant a push mower. Even in the teeming center of the city, there often is a garden in the back and a cat lying in the sun. No upstanding neighborhood pub is without its windowbox of ivy and geraniums. The 18 garden club members on a <LOCATION> Chevron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil platform never have to worry about slugs and aphids, although space is limited in their 10 foot by 8 foot greenhouse bolted to the deck, 100 miles off the <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` You get a great feeling of satisfaction when you sit down to a fresh tomato sprinkled with chopped basil, knowing you've grown them both,'' rig electrician <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobinson </PERSON> told The Daily Mail. Thousands of Londoners work allotments, patches of public land rented for a few pounds a year to families who want to grow their own food. `` We got 60 pounds of strawberries off the allotment last year,'' said <PERSON> Ena </PERSON> <PERSON> Mundy </PERSON>, who's been attending the <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> show for 30 years. She and her husband travel 18 miles twice a week to their allotment because the soil is `` lovely rich and loamy. Now we're retired, it's our main interest,'' she said Outer <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Barnet </ORGANIZATION> borough has 250 acres in allotments, each 10 yards by 30 yards. Most of these amateur gardeners would probably agree with writer <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Titchmarsh </PERSON> who told an interviewer: `` There's really nowhere else in the world I'd rather be than in my garden. When my time comes I'd be happy to peg out there. An epitaph? Gone to Make Manure.''

 More than 17 years after <PERSON> Wilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> mailed a Christmas card to an acquaintance, the post office returned it, unopened. But Mrs. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was n't upset. `` I'm sure that whatever happened was an accident,'' she said. `` I'm sure the post office tries their best not to let this kind of thing happen.'' The card, mailed Dec. 22, 1970, showed up mysteriously last week marked `` return to sender.'' It was intended for <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Mealor </PERSON>, a fellow member of the <ORGANIZATION> Pilot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, who has since died. In 1970, Mrs. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was executive director of the service club for business and professional women. Each year, she mailed hundreds of homemade Christmas cards to friends and club chapters across the country. The card came back with a May 18 postmark from <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> and a May 19 postmark from <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>. It was not delivered postage due, even though it bore a 6-cent stamp. Mrs. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 84, said she has mailed so many Christmas cards that she had no idea this one never reached its destination. No one knows where the card spent the last 17 -LCB- years. <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> Postmaster <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON> was baffled. `` If it was found in my post office, I'm sure I would have heard about it. Given the size of our office, it's hard to imagine it lying around for 18 years,'' <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON> said.

 Call him persistent, call him tenacious, or call him what co-workers at a computer company dubbed him after a three-year struggle to rid the plant grounds of geese: `` Mr. Goosebuster.'' <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Heifetz </PERSON>, 52, facilities manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Bytex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has become a minor celebrity. Employees presented him with a `` Mr. Goosebuster'' plaque and goosebuster emblems can be spotted throughout the company, <PERSON> Heifetz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Heifetz </PERSON>' picture even appeared on the front page of a local newspaper. His fame came after he waged war with the pesky geese, which filled the man-made pond at the plant and, even worse, `` strolled all over the grounds.'' `` They come and proliferate and have babies and they make a holy mess of the property,'' he said. `` They like young, fresh grass so they go grazing all day long. It would n't have been so bad if they stayed out back but they came strolling on the sidewalk near the front entrance.'' At first, he banged pots and pans to frighten the geese away. Then, while researching the problem, he learned that geese are `` deathly afraid of swans'' and bought `` a bunch of fake ones.'' Nothing worked. Last year, when the geese returned in late spring, <PERSON> Heifetz </PERSON> began a new plan of attack. He wired up huge speakers and blared distress calls over the pond. Still, the geese remained. Then <PERSON> Heifetz </PERSON> tried a small, remote-controlled boat. Success at last. `` It made a terrible noise and chased them out,'' he said.

 The government took pity on primary and middle school students who complain of too much homework and testing by setting strict limits on both, an official report said today. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> banned homework for first-grade pupils and set graduated limits for older students. The limits range from 30 minutes a day for second - and third-grade students to an hour daily for sixth-grade pupils, the report said It did not say what the average length of assignments had been. The panel also said pupils `` should not be given the kind of homework that requires heavy monotonous routine work, such as large amounts of copying drills.'' Rote drilling has been the basic method of education in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for centuries. High schools will be allowed to hold major exams only in key subjects and only at the middle and end of terms, the commission said.

 Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Tuesday it was `` a very serious mistake'' for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto trade legislation that requires advance notice of plant closing. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides sought to reassure <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans about the vice president's poor standing in recent polls. `` We have bad polls,'' Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> said after attending a closed-door session with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s top advisers. `` If this were October we'd be suicidal. But it's May.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' sole remaining Democratic rival, campaigned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in advance of the state's June 7 primary. He said he would seek government assistance for a farm town where a dozen children have been diagnosed with cancer in recent years. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent most of the day in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where he issued a statement blasting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the trade bill and linking the veto to negotiations with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who faces indictment on drug charges. `` Any administration that is willing to give Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> 120 days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to give the American worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out on the street,'' he said in a statement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared his independence from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> talks last week, saying he opposed negotiations designed to force the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader to give up his power in exchange for having the drug indictments dropped. The vice president had no official appearances during the day, although he added <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to his list of primary state victories. With a quarter of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had 81 percent to 10 percent for <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who suspended his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidacy earlier this month. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was winning 15 delegates in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, to two for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, and one uncommitted. The vice president wrapped up a majority of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> delegates a month ago. The Democratic primary in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> was a non-binding preference poll and no delegates were at stake. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won easily, with 77 percent to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 14 percent, with 24 percent of the precincts reporting. The next _ and last _ Democratic primary elections will be June 7, with contests in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Although neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was out campaigning during the day, each took steps to rally the troops around their certain candidacies. The vice president's campaign officials announced that Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> would play important roles in the fall campaign in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> was a staunch supporter of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the state's heated caucus campaign _ which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lost in a third place finish _ while <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> was neutral. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> arranged a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday en route to campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. His aides said he would meet with several groups of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and senators, and expected to pick up endorsements from roughly a dozen lawmakers as he closes in on a nominating majority of Democratic National Convention delegates. Three top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers met with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, and one of them, pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, said polls indicate the vice president is running behind but the race is in a `` very artificial period.'' He said he told the lawmakers that, `` What you got to do is get past this <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary before people begin to focus on it -LRB- the presidential race -RRB-.'' Several lawmakers said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to disagree with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy of negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> drew praise `` It's a very symbolic circumstance, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has moved from being vice president to being his own candidate,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> added, `` Almost to a person, they were pleased about the separation on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.;'' But she also said there was concern about recent polls indicating <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads the vice president. `` There was n't anybody up screaming, ` My God, we've got the Titanic,''' she said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' linkage of the trade bill veto with the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> negotiations marked an attempt to hit <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on two issues that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> strategists believe damage the vice president. `` To veto this bill because it will give working people and their families 60 days notice before they're laid off, seems to me to be unconscionable,'' he said. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` do n't understand that for working families who struggle to pay the mortgage, save for their children's education and care for their elders, there is nothing more painful than losing a job.'' `` I think the president is making a very serious mistake. This is a good trade bill. It's a responsible bill,'' he said.

 It is n't easy to hold an audience's attention with a full-length ballet which has no plot, and few choreographers try. <PERSON> Graeme </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> has tried and succeeded with `` Shining.'' The Sydney Dance Company from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> danced the two-hour `` Shining'' Tuesday night as the opening program of a two-week season at the City Center. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> choreographed it in 1986 to mark 10 years as the company's artistic director. The first section, titled `` Dawn,'' had duets, trios, quartets and groups of 14. While the enormously vital and versatile dancers were on stage, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> allowed them no rest.

 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels will offer to lay down their arms on Sept. 1 as part of a comprehensive peace accord to be presented to the Nicaraguan government Wednesday, a congressional aide said Tuesday. Members of the rebels' political directorate, in meetings on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, also said they would not be the first to break a two-month cease-fire after it expires May 30, even if no new truce agreement is in effect. And they said they would accept a proposal for delivery of humanitarian aid to their forces inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by an agency with ties to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But they made it clear that did not mean they were accepting the Sandinista government's unilateral announcement, made a day earlier, that it simply would extend the current truce for another month. Rather, the Contra proposal will include `` all the necessary things for a permanent end to the war in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a member of the directorate and the leader of the negotiating delegation. An aide to House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who was briefed on the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> proposal, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> hoped the move was sincere and constructive. The aide, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, said the setting of a date for the rebels to lay down their arms, in particular, `` appears to be progress.'' In an interview Tuesday night, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` Tomorrow I hope and believe that a major effort will be made to open up the peace plan and to reach a settlement between the two sides in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> ...'' `` Broad suggestions -LRB- are -RRB- going to be made by the resistance, the Contras, that they will accept a certain time to lay down their arms and reintegrate into the society if the government will make certain guarantees of free elections at certain specific dates and guarantee of private properties and the restoration of those civil liberties,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Larry King Live'' program. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said the proposal will go beyond the cease-fire agreement reached two months ago in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and include a timetable for specific political changes called for in last year's regional peace agreement. Those changes include a free and fair electoral system, an independent judiciary with the power to guarantee human rights, removal of the military from <LOCATION> Sandinista </LOCATION> party control and guaranteed property rights, he said. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> also said the rebels were prepared to accept a proposal to have $ 17.7 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid delivered through the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which would subcontract with commercial carriers to distribute supplies to troops inside cease-fire zones in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The foundation is tied to the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, whose secretary general, <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, is on a commission to verify compliance with the cease-fire agreement. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have failed to comply with commitments made in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, and that a simple extension of the current truce would not address those failures. `` An extension of the truce period means an extension for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to keep violating <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, to keep imprisoning union leaders ... to keep interfering with freedom of the press,'' said <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, another directorate member. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> officials say <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> appears to be building up stocks of weapons and making other preparations for an attack on the Contras if the peace talks fail, according to a published report. The officials cite aerial reconnaissance photographs and other evidence they say suggest a military buildup, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Wednesday editions. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the photographs showed that airfields at <LOCATION> Wapsam </LOCATION> near the Honduran border and at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tranquera </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> have been upgraded; that new military storage depots are being built near <LOCATION> Sebaco </LOCATION>, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, and that military supplies are being stockpiled at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tempisque </LOCATION> just outside <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, meanwhile, accused the Sandinistas of foot-dragging, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was looking for `` deeds, not more words.'' `` If the current stalemate in the peace process persists and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> continue their policies of repression, then we will call upon the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider its Feb. 3 decision to curtail assistance to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement issued by the White House. The president said that despite the 60-day truce, `` the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have continued, and indeed intensified their repression of the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> people.'' Since the Sapoa accord was reached, the Contra ranks have been torn by internal bickering and power struggles. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> acknowledged that the rebels now are weaker militarily than they were in March, `` but not politically.'' He said the rebels' primary leverage in the new round of talks will be the threat that if the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> appear intransigent, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could be moved to grant new military aid to the Contras and renew the war. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> noted that the Sandinista attitude softened following a May 12 letter from 24 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who warned that military aid could be resumed if the leftist government did not facilitate delivery of aid to rebel troops inside the country. All five members of the directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance _ <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> _ will go to the talks.

 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has survived a Republican attempt to scale back his pay to reflect the days he spends in his Statehouse office and not on the presidential campaign trail. Late Tuesday, after nearly 10 hours of debate over next year's state budget, Republican Rep. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON> offered an amendment to the $ 1,888,828 intended to pay the governor and his staff Under the language offered by <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would get paid only for days he is in the state. Since the start of this year, <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON> noted, the governor has spent 68 days out of state, 18 days in state and 51 days in which he spent part of the day here and part elsewhere. `` So therefore, for the 68 days he was out of the state, based on his salary of $ 85,000, he owes us $ 15,835,'' the assistant minority leader said. `` With this amendment, what I'm trying to do is bring some fiscal sanity back into the commonwealth. We do have a fiscal crisis. Let's try to address it in his office,'' he said. No Democrat rose to defend the governor, but the amendment was defeated on a voice vote.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has asked <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> lawmakers to approve a crime package designed to tighten state laws on child pornography, drunken driving and criminal sentencing. `` Over the past five years, we have done a lot to fight crime and make our citizens safer here in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' the Democratic presidential hopeful said Tuesday in testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s joint <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` That's because we've worked together on a get-tough, no-nonsense approach to crime that's based on results, not rhetoric.'' But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said recent drug-related violence in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was `` a grim reminder'' of the expanding agenda of crime issues. `` When we find loopholes in our laws that allow criminals to avoid punishment, or when we find programs that could be strengthened to protect innocent children, then we need to work together and take action,'' he said. He appealed for swift action on: _ The latest version of his `` presumptive sentencing'' bill, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has offered annually in his second and third terms The legislation would establish sentencing guidelines for crimes and allow prosecutors to appeal sentences they consider too low. _ A bill to restore the state law against child pornography, which was struck down earlier this year by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on the grounds that it was unconstitutionally broad On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed to review the state court's action, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> argued that the state needs a law on the books immediately, in order to prevent `` the devastating and lifelong psychological and physical damage'' caused by sexual exploitation. _ Legislation to increase penalties against drivers who leave the scene of an accident The governor's brother was killed by a hit-and-run driver. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' legislative package also would allow <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> police to cross state lines `` in hot pursuit'' of drunken drivers and increase the penalties for refusing to submit to a breath test. For the first time, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also supported a measure allowing judges to revoke the driving license of anyone convicted of a drug offense. In his testimony, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> credited the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and his own administration for making <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> safer. He said overall crime is down more than 13 percent in the last four years, the second-largest such decline of any state.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> backers of a major trade bill are expecting an uphill battle to find enough votes to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, in striking contrast to the quick and overwhelming <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote to reverse the president's action. `` We have to have another three votes at this point and I do n't know where they are going to come from,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, a chief sponsor of the 1,000-page trade measure The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take up the legislation after it returns from the Memorial Day recess. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the legislation on Tuesday came as no surprise. He has been critical in numerous speeches of a provision that would require companies to give employees 60 days notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. He has said that businesses need flexibility to survive hard times. In his veto message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> repeated that argument. `` I support voluntarily giving workers and communities as much advance warning as possible when a layoff or closing becomes necessary. ... It is the humane thing to do. `` But I object to the idea that the federal government would arbitrarily mandate, for all conditions and under all circumstances, exactly when and in what form that notification should take place.'' The president urged lawmakers to submit a revised version trade bill that he could sign in good conscience. Within hours of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted, 308-113, to override it. That was far more than needed to be successful. Sixty Republicans broke with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to vote for the override, while only one Democrat, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, supported the president. The plant-closings measure is among scores of provisions contained in the bill. The main ones would overhaul the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system of import restrictions. Others range from repealing the windfall profits tax to adding billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies. Democratic leaders have argued that patching together a stripped down trade bill might be tough before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaves town for the campaign trail. Uncertain of override prospects in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, many Democrats focused on making the debate a campaign issue. `` I happen to think it's a better issue for Democrats than for Republicans,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, called the president's action `` unconscionable.'' He said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` do n't understand that for working families who struggle to pay the mortgage, save for their children's education and care for their elders, there is nothing more painful than losing a job. He contrasted the veto to a tentative deal under which drug charges against <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader, would be dropped if he agreed to relinquish power and leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by August. `` Any administration that is willing to give General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> 120 days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to give the American worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out on the street,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that he vetoed the measure `` with sincere regret,'' but said in his message that returning the measure to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was necessary. `` I am convinced this bill will cost jobs and damage our economic growth,'' the president said. He said that the American economy has created 16 million jobs during his administration and that the unemployment rate is at its lowest point in 14 years. He also said that the measure would `` push us in the direction of protectionism. Closing our borders is not the solution to opening foreign markets,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Administration supporters rallied to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s support following the veto. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, R-Minn., scoffed at the image of `` unfeeling and mean-spirited owners of large and small American businesses putting upon weak and defenseless workers who are about to be thrown out on the street ... unless big government puts its firm and fatherly hand'' on the situation `` As usual, this House believes that big government knows more than we in private life,'' <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> said. `` This debate paints a depressing view of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and it is inaccurate.'' But the veto also unleashed a torrent of criticism on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. `` The Japanese are laughing now that you have vetoed this trade bill,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` For seven years, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has just said no to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers,'' Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., issued a statement saying that `` the country understands the importance of notice about plant closings and layoffs, even if the White House does not. `` Voluntary notice is a fig leaf over the problem,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, however, recalled in a statement that restrictions on exports of oil from his state remain in the legislation. `` I voted against the trade bill when it passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and intend to vote to sustain the president's veto,'' <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> said.

 Defense lawyers are accusing independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> of trying to punish former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and two co-defendants for trying to tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the `` whole truth'' about the Iran-Contra affair. The defense contends that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was `` completely wrong on the law'' by claiming that hundreds of statements that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealer <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> made to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could be used against them as evidence of criminal wrongdoing. By claiming the defendants waived their limited immunity grants from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` seeks to punish defendants for responding fully and in good faith to congressional inquiries, when compelled to do so over vehement objection, and for relaying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the nation what occurred and why,'' the defense said in a brief filed Tuesday. Although North, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> testified under immunity grants that prohibit use of their statements as evidence against them, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> contends that the defendants waived the privilege against self-incrimination by volunteering answers that were not responsive to questions posed by the Iran-Contra committees. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has said that he would not use any of this congressional testimony during the trial if the court denies a defense request to conduct an extensive hearing to determine if his investigation was tainted by impermissible use of the defendants' immunized statements. The defense called <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s offer an attempt `` to threaten the court with a lengthy inquiry into immunized testimony, and then to use that threat as leverage to strike a favorable bargain with the court.'' `` This tactic is unseemly,'' the defense lawyers said in a joint pleading. North, the fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> are accused of conspiring with retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to defraud the government by diverting <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, also an arms dealer, testified without an immunity grant from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. North, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> contend that their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination would be violated if they were forced to stand trial on criminal charges following their compelled congressional testimony. They claim that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s prosecution was tainted by illegal use of their sworn statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is scheduled to hear arguments on the issue on Thursday. In its latest filing, the defense said `` there is no claim that defendants uttered a single word, during the course of their congressional testimony, that was outside the subject matter of the congressional inquiry.'' North, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> were not waiving any rights when they `` explained their answers; or sought to provide useful, related information to be sure their answers were complete and accurate _ in short, the ` whole truth' they had sworn to provide.'' The defense said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s position would force <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to examine each and every one of the hundreds of statements to verify <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s claim they were exempt from immunity <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> contended that the unprotected statements include <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s admission that he approved the diversion of arms-sale profits to the Contras but did not tell President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to ensure that the president could deny involvement if the operation were exposed. The unprotected statements also include <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s remarks that during Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s November 1986 investigation, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> destroyed a presidential intelligence finding authorizing <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> involvement in one 1985 arms shipment, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> contended. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> also claimed that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s statements that he destroyed documents in October and November 1986 could be used as evidence to prove charges that the fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide obstructed <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s inquiry. In a separate filing on Tuesday, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office said that `` it is clear beyond doubt'' that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> waged a `` public relations battle'' during their congressional testimony. `` In utter defiance of the questions put to them, they sought to win with speeches and arguments,'' the prosecution brief said.

 A propane tanker truck overturned, burst into flames and burned intensely through the day Tuesday, forcing police to close two highways, shut a section of the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> and evacuate 2,000 homes. There were no serious injuries, officials said. The driver and a trainee who was riding with him escaped before the explosion. The driver was treated at the scene for a shoulder cut. The fire was so intense and potentially explosive that firefighters had to move back from the fire early in the afternoon, leaving automatic pumpers to throw water on the blaze. Nearly 1,000 homes within half a mile of the burning truck were evacuated, with residents taken to a church, <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police spokeswoman Officer <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, a department public information officer, said more homes were evacuated at 10:30 p.m. bringing the total to about 2,000. `` -LRB- Police -RRB- cars went through the area with loudspeakers urging people to evacuate,'' he said. Two unmanned automatic fire trucks were pumping water onto the fire late Tuesday night, hours after the 9:30 a.m. accident. Authorities said the tanker, carrying about 2,500 gallons of propane, could burn for as long as 30 hours. Sections of the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway, where the accident occurred, and the Sunrise Highway, near the expressway, were closed, <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> twice suspended service on its busiest branch, between <LOCATION> Wantagh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amityville </LOCATION>, said railroad spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. He estimated that 70,000 train commuters were affected. <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Krausch </PERSON> said the truck overturned on the southbound lane of the expressway when the driver experienced a problem with the truck's rear wheels. The driver, identified by police as <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Vai </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Westbury </LOCATION>, was arrested at the scene on an outstanding traffic warrant and was also charged with driving with a suspended license and failure to produce a license. He was taken later released on $ 100 bail. <PERSON> Krausch </PERSON> said the truck was owned by Conservative Gas of <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Democrats Instantly Make Campaign Issue Of Veto</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hours after <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aides tried to explain to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans when things would start going right for the vice president, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed a trade bill the Democrats were itching to make an issue in the fall presidential campaign. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee-to-be, fired off this response Tuesday when the president's veto message reached <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>: `` Any administration that is willing to give General -LRB- <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> 120 days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to give the American worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out on the street.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was referring to the provision that would require companies to give workers and communities notice before closing plants. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he thought giving such notice was `` the humane thing to do'' but he objected to making it mandatory. `` I do n't really see it as a campaign issue,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>. `` I could be wrong.'' The chairman of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON> was one of 60 Republicans who deserted the president and voted to override the veto. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 308-113 to override the veto, but <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders have predicted the president will prevail in that chamber. The Democrats certainly are betting it will be an issue in the fall campaign. `` I happen to think it's a better issue for the Democrats than for the Republicans,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., asked, `` Why hand it to us on a silver platter? Like the president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared to be walking a narrow line on the trade bill. During a recent campaign appearance, he even had kind words for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> plant closing law that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> often cites. `` In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, they have a plant closing law, it's voluntary It's not like the federal government imposing it,'' said the vice president. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law offers financial and management assistance to companies and those that accept are then required to give 90 days notice of plant closings. The trade bill veto came on the same day that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aides were getting encouragement from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans for his recent moves away from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, specifically on the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> negotiations. Disagreeing with the idea of dropping drug charges against the military leader and de facto ruler of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is not a politically high-risk move. Likewise, one must expect that if Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> continues to cling to his job, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will begin to hint that he thinks it's time for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to step aside. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't need high-priced pollsters to tell him <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> are n't bringing him a lot of votes. But a far more critical question is how many general election votes <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> brings his vice president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> were sympathetic about the vice president's plight. `` I think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has to say, as he has for seven years, as long as we're asking what he would do as vice president, he will support the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` He can talk about how he would take the offensive in'89 in other ways, but I think it would be very, very foolish to allow himself to be drawn into day by day picky fights.'' But others were n't so concerned about `` picky fights.'' `` What I'd like to see would be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> coming out on more of the issues and articulating the positions that he has,'' said <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>. `` I think he's beginning to do that now.''

 The 20th anniversary production of `` Hair,'' the rock musical that shocked the world with frontal nudity, will be shown in a demure version at a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> benefit for children suffering from AIDS. Some say a show that celebrates carefree love and drug use is not the best choice to raise money to fight AIDS, a fatal disease transmitted by sexual contact and sharing of intravenous needles. The one-night presentation Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> has been watered down to avoid eliciting blushes from diplomats. Four-letter words are edited out, free spirits will have to cover themselves with fig leaves and there will be no burning of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> draft cards. `` This is a modified version for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' one of the creators, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rado </PERSON>, said. `` The street language had to go in a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> format. I guess they could n't take the four-letter words. There are n't that many of them.'' `` But the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> just said ` No,''' added co-author <PERSON> Gerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragni </PERSON>. At the end of the first act, the cast will not stand singing in the nude before the audience. That was in 1968. This is a swishy, black-tie affair for the Establishment where the best seats cost $ 5,000. `` The first lady would say no to drug songs,'' production manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosboom </PERSON> said in an interview, referring to <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s anti-drug campaign whose slogan is, `` Just say no to drugs.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, an honorary chairman of the benefit, will not be present to hear the 1988 rendition of the songs `` Starshine'' and the `` Age of Aquarius,'' although she consults astrologers. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife leave for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit this morning. Publicist <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said that when `` Hair'' opened 20 years ago at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Public Theater the stars were in almost the same positions as they will be Thursday. <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the original `` Hair'' astrologer who now calls herself <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Talma-Lord </PERSON>, has worked out the astrological chart for the show. `` The moon again is in the seventh house and Jupiter is aligned with Mars,'' said the astrologer. <PERSON> Bosboom </PERSON> quipped that `` There will be no naked truths here at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>,'' but that the soul of the show has remained intact. `` Yes, we had to change the content to suit the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` The themes are there but some lyrics have changed.'' He said the numerous changes were made both out of self-censorship by the creators and at the request of nervous <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> bureaucrats. One <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official muttered privately that the show was `` ill-considered, inappropriate and an embarrassment. `` How do you have a show celebrating free love and sex at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, of all places, when you are trying to warn against AIDS?'' said the official who demanded anonymity. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, also is transmitted through contaminated blood or blood products and from infected mothers to their unborn babies. The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancers. <PERSON> Ragni </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rado </PERSON> have written 14 new songs and the first half of the new prodution is an update `` for the next generation.'' The second half is a nostalgic selection of oldies. `` Sodomy,'' a song from the original, wo n't be sung at Thursday's production. It is now an instrumental by <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangione </PERSON>. `` Some of the songs we had to delete, because out of context from the original show, they do n't work,'' <PERSON> Ragni </PERSON> said in a recent interview. Of `` Sodomy,'' he said: `` It's quite beautiful and effective and I never had heard it as an instrumental.'' The changes have been made to address current issues, such as the depletion of the Ozone layer and banning nuclear bombs. Deletions do away with the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War hippie protest song about <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> taking the IRT to find people on LSD. But there still is crooning over `` Donna'' and the search for the `` 16-year-old virgin.'' `` I'm surprised they left that one in,'' said <PERSON> Bosboom </PERSON>. The production involves more than 100 people and includes some members of the original cast. A few of the original players decided not to take part when they learned that conservative <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> was a member of the sponsoring <ORGANIZATION> Creo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. It is a non-profit organization working with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>'s Fund to help young AIDS victims The Creo Society Fund For Children With AIDS is trying to raise more than $ 2 million from the benefit.

<HEAD>Reagan To Rest In Finland, the Way Station to Russia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Of all European capitals, <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> is probably the most fitting way station for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit next week. Geographically and historically, neutral <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> sees itself as the no-man's land between East and West. It also has great saunas, as the president may have heard from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. The secretary of state has made four rest stops in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in less than three years on his way to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and reportedly has become an enthusiast of the traditional Finnish sweat bath. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> early Thursday morning, and will spend three nights there recovering from jet lag and preparing for his May 29-June 2 summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In his only scheduled activities outside his regular Saturday radio address, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will meet Friday with President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> and then address Finnish leaders on human rights. He will speak in <LOCATION> Finlandia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, where 35 heads of state signed the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords on military security, economic cooperation and humanitarian issues. American Jewish leaders have announced they will hold a vigil in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s stay to draw attention to the demands by Soviet Jews for freedom to emigrate. Though <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> probably wo n't see much of the city, <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>'s Russian flavor offers him a taste of things to come With its trolley cars, broad avenues and 19th century buildings, the city has been used as a set for `` Gorky Park'' and other movies about <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Most of <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> was devastated by fire in 1808, the same year <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> ended its 600-year rule of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and ceded the territory to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. It was a Russian duchy until 1917. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s life in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s shadow has been the theme of its politics for centuries. It shares a 793-mile border with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the longest of any non-communist state. The Finns like to say they were `` defeated, but not conquered'' by the Soviets in World War II, since they retained an independent government and parliament. But they were forced to cede territory, pay reparations and sign a Treaty of Cooperation and Friendship. Their post-war caution toward the Soviets gave rise to the term `` Finlandization'' as a synonym for obsequiousness in a country's foreign policy `` With all my heart, I would like that word to be abolished,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Harri </PERSON> <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON> said with uncharacteristic anger during a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference last month. <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON>, who took office in April 1987, is the first prime minister from the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> since the war. Before last year, the party was frozen out of government in deference to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> because of its staunchly anti-Soviet image. Finns defend their policy by saying they are nobody's lackey. `` Having for long felt themselves to be menaced by the East and let down by the West, the Finnish people today feel they are getting the best of both worlds,'' writes <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakobson </PERSON>, a former Finnish ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` The supreme test for <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> has been to find a way to live in peace with her powerful neighbor without giving up her own system of government and her ties with the Western world,'' <PERSON> Jakobson </PERSON> wrote in `` <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>: Myth and Reality'' published last year. During the last year <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> has increasingly turned away from the Soviets and more toward <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In April, it decided to join the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, which it once saw as an instrument of the Cold War. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> had been the only major non-communist European country to stay outside the council, which monitors human rights in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Trade with the Soviets dropped from 25 percent of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s total two years ago to 15 percent last year More than 60 percent of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s trade is with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and about five percent is with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it has found no mechanical cause of sudden acceleration in its C-body and H-body cars and says the federal investigations of complaints do n't mean a defect exists. The automaker made the statement after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it had opened an engineering evaluation of 1.4 million 1985-88 C-body cars, including the Oldsmobile 98, <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electra </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON> <PERSON> Deville </PERSON> and Fleetwood. The agency last year began an investigation of 703,000 GM H-body cars, including the 1986-87 <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 88 and <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeSabre </ORGANIZATION>, and the 1987 <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION>. In another matter, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> has dropped a challenge to an order from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and will recall 82,600 Pontiacs and Buicks from the 1981 model year to fix pollution control systems, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Also, a federal appeals court Tuesday upheld <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to reopen an investigation of alleged safety defects in 1966-1979 Ford cars. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said it had received 110 complaints involving <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s C-body cars, including reports of 67 accidents resulting in 43 injuries. The agency has received more than 500 complaints about sudden acceleration in the H-body cars, including reports of more than 300 accidents. The H-car and C-car investigations are separate cases on the <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> docket. `` We have never been able to find a common design flaw or manufacturing defect,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON>. `` We've never been able to determine a cause for these incidents `` There is nobody that denies there are incidents of so-called sudden acceleration, in ours and other cars, but we've never been able to pin down an engineering or manfacturing root cause for them,'' he said. The C-body and H-body cars use the same V-6 engine, but `` nobody has indicted the engine,'' <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON> said. The C-car investigation was started at the request of the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer group often critical of the auto industry and its regulators. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> of the center said design similarities suggested a connection between sudden acceleration reports in the C-body and H-body cars. Sudden acceleration allegations in recent years have involved nearly every auto manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency has conducted about 50 investigations into sudden acceleration involving vehicles made by 20 manufacturers. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s latest defect investigation report, covering April, showed four other ongoing engineering analyses and cases involving alleged sudden acceleration or throttle control problems. They involved the 1986-88 <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acura </ORGANIZATION> and Sterling and the 1986-87 Mercedes 300E, as well as two that have resulted in recalls: the 1979-87 <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> 280Z and 300Z and the 1978-86 <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000. In the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> case, the cars in question are equipped with a 4.3-liter, six-cylinder engine and were sold as the Pontiac LeMans, <ORGANIZATION> Lemans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wagon </ORGANIZATION>, Grand Prix, <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bonneville </PERSON> and Firebird, and as the <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regal </ORGANIZATION>, Century and Century Wagon. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it believes the cars comply but it is dropping the challenge `` to prevent unnecessary litigation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> decision reversed an earlier ruling by the same court that the Center for Auto Safety could seek judicial review of the agency's refusal to reopen a case involving <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> transmissions that have a tendency to slip into reverse gear. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, executive director of the center, said there still were 8 million cars with the allegedly defective transmissions on the road.

 Five relatives, including a man once accused of helping convicted spy <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> rob banks, were arrested for trying to smuggle 45 tons of marijuana and hashish into the country, authorities said. `` The war on drugs is being fought on many fronts. This is one of the skirmishes. This is a battle we happen to have won,'' said Agent <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> of the Drug Enforcement Administration. At least 30 tons of hashish and 15 tons of marijuana were seized from welded compartments of a barge after it was boarded Monday night as it entered <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The tug Intrepid Venture, which had the barge in tow, also was seized. Authorities believe the Asian-grown drugs, with a wholesale value of $ 162 million, had been loaded off a `` mother ship'' 1,000 miles offshore. It took eight hours for agents to cut metal covers off the compartments to remove the contraband. `` This was a very sophisticated operation,'' said <PERSON> Rollin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klink </PERSON>, agent in charge for the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, who characterized the organization behind the operation as `` huge.'' He said `` a piece of minor'' information led to the bust, but would not elaborate. `` We knew about this boat before it was ever loaded,'' added <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The tug's skipper, <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION>, and four relatives were charged Tuesday in federal court with large-scale drug smuggling and conspiracy, punishable by at least 10 years in prison without the possibility of parole and fines of up to $ 4 million. According to court documents, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was a prison compatriot of <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, who was convicted in 1977 of espionage for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> reportedly went on the lam with <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> after his sensational Jan. 19, 1980, escape from the federal prison at <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, whose exploits were portrayed in the book and movie `` The Falcon and the Snowman,'' was serving a 40-year sentence. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was charged with harboring a fugitive and in connection with 13 <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> bank robberies that occurred after <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>'s capture in late 1981. But the charges against <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> were dismissed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> for lack of evidence. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> pleaded guilty to the robberies and received 25 additional years in prison. Also arrested in the drug bust were <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s 25-year-old son, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION>; the skipper's nephews <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 25, of <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION>; and stepson, <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastin </PERSON>, 25, of <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>. About 1,400 plastic-wrapped cardboard boxes filled with Southeast Asian marijuana and 1,200 burlap bags of pressed hashish were found in the tug. The 70-foot tug left <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> with the barge in tow in early May, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. Drug agents tracked the vessels part of the way to the mother ship and back. The whereabouts of that ship remain unknown. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> was convicted in 1977 of selling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellite surveillance secrets to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> company in <LOCATION> Redondo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, where he had worked from mid-1974 to 1976 as a security clerk. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> is now serving time at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, Ill.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and his European colleagues in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will discuss financial contributions to the military alliance at a two-day meeting scheduled to begin Thursday. The alliance's European defense ministers will gather today for a routine meeting at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional critics of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> claim the European <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations do n't pay enough for the common Western defense and have threatened to withdraw some of the 320,000 American troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Such criticism has risen as constraints in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> budget get tighter. The <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies counter that most of the air, land and sea forces of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> are European. `` It's a question of convincing -LRB- the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- that what the Europeans do reflects a fair assumption ... of the common defense burden,'' said a senior <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ministers will set up a panel to review the financial issue and hope to present a report by year's end. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will attend the meeting on his way to join President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense chiefs also will approve goals for each of the 16 members for 1989-1994, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The ministers were expected to adopt 26 long-term force goals, 23 of these dealing with planning for arms systems to be operational by the late 1990s. The ministers also will consider a multinational force to offset <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s decision to end the commitment of its Air-Sea Transportable brigade to reinforce northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> in times of crisis, the officials said. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> announced a year ago that it would end its commitment in order to consolidate its forces in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ministers were expected to ask <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to take in 72 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 jetfighters that are to be removed from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base at <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s government, under domestic political pressure, asked for their removal. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Deputy <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he expects <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> will agree to be host for the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing.

<HEAD>Superpowers Hint At Readiness to Reduce Military Forces in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After four decades of mind-boggling spending for weapons and 15 years of go-nowhere negotiations, the superpowers are making hopeful noises about reducing military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It goes beyond the peace rhetoric President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have voiced at their summits in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has conceded for the first time that it does indeed have an advantage over the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in some military categories. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> leaders hint they may no longer feel the need for such superiority. `` It appears that in 1988 both East and West are ready for a new beginning,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON>, who spent 1979 to 1982 as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to the multilateral Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks that have dragged on inconclusively since 1973. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was said to be prepared to touch on the need for conventional disarmament, in a speech in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, on his way to the May 29-June 2 summit, but there's no telling what he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might do on the issue. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are bracing for the possibility that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will suggest that the two superpowers meet this fall to discuss cutting their ground forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by as much as 25 percent. One official raised the possibility that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might wait until after the summit to announce a unilateral withdrawal of 50,000 to 70,000 troops. Another official said 100,000 troops could be pulled back. After Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> attended a pre-summit planning session with the Soviets earlier this month there was little talk of conventional weaponry being a major topic at the summit. Optimism on the issue focused on the possibility of a mid-July agreement on a mandate for lower level negotiations, the Conventional Stability Talks. Before they begin such talks, the Western participants want further Eastern European compliance with human rights accords signed in 1975. Still, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are hoping the problems can be settled in time for the <ORGANIZATION> CST </ORGANIZATION> conference to begin in October. `` Of course, the CST talks will not reach agreement overnight and, indeed, it will be well into the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president's term before they produce results,'' said former <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> staff member <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longstreth </PERSON>, in a study for the Federation of American Scientists. `` With time and patience, the logjam can be broken and a new era of stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> achieved,'' <PERSON> Longstreth </PERSON> wrote. Since the end of World War II, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have been dominated by huge armies of men, tanks and artillery suitable for attack. By Pentagon estimates, the Soviets have 230 divisions, compared with 121 for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>; an edge of 52,000-to-24 ,250 in main battle tanks and a 42,000-to-18 ,350 edge in The Soviets have said they need such forces to keep the military balance. In a speech last year, however, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged that `` asymmetries'' exist in the force comparisons and said the goal of each side should be `` reasonable sufficiency,'' rather than superiority. In a letter to a group of Western scientists last November, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said forces on both sides should be structured to `` provide all that is needed for the repulsion of any possible aggression but could not be used for offensive purposes.'' There is no evidence the Soviets have put such doctrines into effect. And they note that there are `` asymmetries'' in favor of the West, notably in the number of ground-attack planes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts like <PERSON> Longstreth </PERSON> note as well that negotiations to reduce conventional weapons are a monumental prospect because so many different types of armaments, units and national interests are involved. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have suggested that as a first step, both sides should try to reduce forces that could be used in a surprise attack and should institute confidence-building measures that reduce fear of such an attack. Steps in that direction have already been taken under an agreement that has led to an increase in the number of observers each bloc has been sending to the other side's war games. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies will be paying particular attention to any developments in this field at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. Now that medium-range missiles are to be banned under the pact signed last December at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting, the allies are zeroing in on conventional forces as their next arms control target. `` Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Soviets have voiced an apparent willingness to embrace arms control concepts which just a few years ago would have seemed unattainable,'' <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said recently. He added: `` A word of caution is in order. It is too soon to determine how many of these concepts can be translated into reality. In areas such as conventional arms control, we must put Soviet rhetoric to the test with bold innovative proposals of our own.''

<HEAD>Text Of Reagan's Message On Veto Of Trade Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Reagan-Trade Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto message Tuesday on the trade bill. To the House of Representatives: It is with sincere regret that today I must disapprove and return HR 3, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. We worked long and hard to produce legislation that would enhance our country's ability to meet foreign competition head-on _ to strengthen our trade laws and remove restrictions on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s great economic engine And we came very close to developing such a bill. Unfortunately, as the process came to a close, provisions were included that simply make this bill, on balance, bad for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ particularly working men and women. The criteria I used in reaching this decision were whether this legislation will create jobs and help sustain our economic growth. I am convinced this bill will cost jobs and damage our economic growth. During this administration the American economy has created 16 million new jobs. Our unemployment rate is the lowest in 14 years, with more Americans working than ever before in our history. And we are experiencing the longest peacetime expansion this country has ever seen. While this has been going on at home, many of our trading partners have had a different economic situation. Perhaps the most compelling and important comparison is that over the past decade, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has created more than twice as many jobs as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> combined. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> economy, which foreign leaders have dubbed the `` American miracle,'' is not a freak accident or a statistical curiosity. It is the result of seven years of consistent policies: lower tax rates, reduced regulation, control returned to state and local governments. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tendency to have government be all things to all people has been reversed, and we have gotten government off the backs of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. In contrast, many foreign countries remain hamstrung by archaic policies and are now trying to remove these impediments, to reform tax systems, to make labor markets more flexible, and to encourage entrepreneurs. That is not to say that we can not do more here at home _ we can. That is why I forwarded proposals to improve our competitive strength and why we worked hard with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to try to achieve a positive, forward-looking bill. Unfortunately, that is not the bill the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed and sent to my desk. The issue receiving the most attention in this bill is the mandatory requirement for businesses to give advance notice of closings or layoffs. I support voluntarily giving workers and communities as much advance warning as possible when a layoff or closing becomes necessary. It allows the workers, the employer, the community, time to adjust to the dislocation. It is the humane thing to do. But I object to the idea that the federal government would arbitrarily mandate, for all conditions and under all circumstances, exactly when and in what form that notification should take place. There are many circumstances under which such mandatory notification would actually force a faltering business to close _ by driving away creditors, suppliers, customers, and in the process destroying jobs. While the legislation attempts to mitigate this outcome, its `` faltering business'' exemption is too ambiguous to be workable and invites untold litigation. These concerns are real, not simply philosophical or theoretical. The experience of the <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1980s, for example, is indicative of the need to be flexible to meet foreign competition and indeed to survive. They had to utilize layoffs and temporary plant closings to respond to competitive developments. And, as one executive of that company stated, they did not have the luxury then, nor do they now, of knowing with certainty what business conditions would be like 60 days in the future. Without the ability to be agile and responsive, they might have closed their doors permanently.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>'s experience is repeated many times over throughout our economy. One independent analysis shows that if this law had been in place between 1982 and 1986, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have produced almost one-half million fewer jobs. And that is what this debate is about _ creating jobs and keeping them _ not losing jobs by the straitjacket of regulations. Over a year ago, I submitted legislation that would provide assistance to workers, employers, and communities in the event of a layoff or closing. The program would serve virtually every dislocated worker who needs it with training, education, and assistance in securing a new job and provide an incentive for giving advance notice of layoffs and closings. Ironically, the one piece of that package that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected was a direct incentive for business to give advance notices of closing and layoffs. We need labor laws that fit the flexible, fast-paced economy of the 1990s, not restrictive leftovers from the 1930s agenda. And I encourage the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in any subsequent trade bill to include a program that provides incentives for such notice. There are other provisions in the legislation that provide disincentives to our sustained economic growth or serve some narrow special interests: _ New restrictions on the export, transportation, and even utilization of Alaskan oil further complicate the overbearing regulatory scheme that already impedes the development of Alaskan oil fields It is the wrong policy. We need to provide incentives, not restrictions, for the production of oil in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> so that we can reduce our dependence on foreign suppliers. Further, as the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has now recognized, it amounts to an unconstitutional discrimination against a single state. _ A mistaken effort to revive discredited industrial policy planning through a so-alled council on competitiveness that will open even more venues for special pleaders _ A requirement to negotiate a new centralized international institution to arrange the forgiveness of billions of dollars of debt around the world _ all supposedly without increasing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes or adding to our debt _ Expanded ethanol imports that could harm <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain producers _ An amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act that prevents the president from moving swiftly to block blatant enemy propaganda material from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, even during wartime While the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did a remarkable job in watering down or eliminating the most protectionist provisions, there remain sections of the bill that push us in the direction of protectionism. Closing our borders is not the solution to opening foreign markets. We need to demand to be treated fairly and take a strong stand against barriers abroad. In short, we need to open markets, not close them. While there are objectionable portions of the bill, there are also desirable provisions. There is negotiating authority so that the next president will have congressional support to continue to seek agreements that open markets abroad. That, coupled with new trade law tools to strengthen the hand of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in international trade negotiations, will mean that this country can enter the next decade with new agreements that reduce barriers and encourage trade. There are strengthened protections for intellectual property, such as copyrights, and a reduction in various handicaps to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters. Finally, the bill would remove a major impediment to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil production by repealing the windfall profits tax. That is why I want a trade bill, and why I like much of this bill. But I regret that the addition of a few counterproductive and costly measures outweigh the positive features of this particular legislation. I will continue to work vigorously to secure sound legislation this year. Let me reiterate what I have said on a number of occasions. I am committed to enactment of a responsible trade bill this year. I have heard some say that there is not time to send me a second bill after my veto is sustained; my response is that there are many months left in 1988 _ time to sign a trade bill this year. I urge prompt action on a second bill immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sustains my veto. -LRB- Signed -RRB- <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>

<HEAD>South Africa To Begin Evicting Black Settlers Next Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said it will begin evicting 1,800 blacks next month from a settlement designated for people of mixed race. Civil rights workers called the plan a revival of forced removals. In another development, state radio reported that a black had spoken for the first time in an official proceeding at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Parliament building. Blacks make up 75 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 35 million people but have no representation in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and no vote in national affairs. In announcing the planned evictions at <LOCATION> Lawaiicamp </LOCATION>, white officials said on Tuesday that the 40-year-old black community is an illegal, unsanitary squatter camp. They deny the actions will constitute forced removal. But residents of Lawaiicamp say they are determined to stay where they are. In 1984, President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said there would be no more forced removals of the sort that resettled an estimated 3.5 million people from 1950 to 1983. But critics say the policy continues under different names, such as `` slum clearance'' and `` squatter control.'' Lawaiicamp adjoins the township of <PERSON> George </PERSON>, which <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> represented in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> before becoming president in 1984, and is five miles from a scenic stretch of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> coastline east of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The government wants to move Lawaiicamp residents to <LOCATION> Sandkraal </LOCATION>, about a mile further from <PERSON> George </PERSON>, which was established four years ago to be the area's official black township. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s mayor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, told a news conference on Tuesday that Lawaiicamp residents have until May 31 to move voluntarily. The town council plans to apply for eviction orders in court on June 1 and to demolish the 180 remaining Lawaiicamp homes once they are vacated. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said evicted families will be paid compensation and provided with new homes. About 800 families have already moved from <LOCATION> Lawaiicamp </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sandkraal </LOCATION>, and the government claims they enjoy better services and amenities. The mayor said violence would not be used against residents resisting eviction, but did not explain how this could be assured. The current <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member for <PERSON> George </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smit </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Lawaiicamp </PERSON> is illegal because it is on land designated for use by people of mixed race. A new mixed-race township is to be developed on the site. In early 1986, the government tried to evict <PERSON> Lawaiicamp </PERSON> residents but backed off because of legal challenges and stiff resistance. This time, the government says it will not yield. The precedent-setting speech by a black at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building came on Tuesday during committee debate in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> on the proposed budget for <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> <PERSON> Temba </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyati </PERSON>, a black appointed last year to the provincial executive committee, spoke about the importance of municipal government. He later told the state-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> blacks should view participation in local government as a first step toward sharing power at higher levels. A new constitution in 1984 created the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and mixed-race chambers of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> but still excluded the black majority from national affairs. The white chamber is able to get its say on all major legislative issues.

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> says he will try to push stock market reform legislation to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor next month, even though <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials say that the need for such a measure is dubious. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, chided four federal officials who appeared before the panel on Tuesday for producing a report on last fall's stock market crash that suggested there is scant need for legislation. `` I can tell you, we're going to go ahead'' with a bill, said <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> told the authors of the study that they had made `` pitiful'' progress in formulating suggestions for calming the nation's jittery financial exchanges and nervous investors The four officials were <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. `` You have let down the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people at a critical time,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> told the officials. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> team that wrote the report, sidestepped several questions about when the group would suggest needed legislation, saying, `` We're not legislatively driven, we're decision driven. The working group's report, released May 16, suggested several mild steps for dealing with the markets' ills. They included a call for an hourlong trading halt in the nation's stock, futures and options markets if the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunges by 250 points in a single day. Such a decline has occurred only once: last Oct. 19's 508-point drop, which has triggered on ongoing look at the markets' volatility by the government and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> introduced legislation on March 31 that would establish a committee consisting of the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The committee would oversee issues that affect all of the nation's markets, such as coordinating margins _ or downpayments _ exchanged in transactions, and setting up `` circuit breakers'' to halt trading during emergencies. `` My aim ... is to make sure that there is an accountable entity with both the responsibility and the expertise to make the decisions on intermarket issues,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said. Currently, the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> oversees the futures markets, while the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> share responsibility for the stock and options exchanges. After the hearing, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> told reporters he expected his committee to send the legislation to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in June. With <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' schedule abbreviated this year because of the elections _ and with some lawmakers joining the administration in opposing strong legislative action on the problem _ it seems unlikely that any bill will become law in 1988. `` It makes it much harder to have the administration opposed,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> conceded. `` The president has the veto, and the administration has influence with many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Sentiment on the banking committee on the need for legislation seems split, and not along party lines. While Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said, `` We'd be darned fools to say that all is well'' with the financial markets, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, D-Ala., said, `` A lot of us here ... do n't believe you can legislate investors' confidence. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> has dissented from his colleagues on several points, arguing that futures margins should be raised and that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> should oversee futures trading. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> meets Thursday to fashion legislative proposals that will be submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by next week.

<HEAD>New Hungarian Party Chief Concedes Economic Failures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, said he will speed up economic reforms planned for late in the year, but cautioned Hungarians not to expect a swift economic turnaround. He also conceded that since he became prime minister in June 1987, his government has failed to revitalize <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s sluggish economy. `` Thirty years of accumulated tension can not be dissolved overnight,'' he told the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday in his first lengthy interview since being named party general secretary two days earlier. `` The danger of the reform is the accompanying illusions. Many think that we shall pass 10 reforms and the country's situation will change. This is not so,'' he said. The 57-year-old <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> will continue as premier at least until <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> announces a new head of government. He replaced longtime party chief <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, a hardliner. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said financial moves alone could not solve this nation's economic crisis and acknowledged that some political change must accompany the new measures He said appointing new Cabinet ministers and choosing a new head of government probably would take place this fall. He praised <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> and said that the idea of naming <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> party president, a new post that is expected to be largely ceremonial, was `` the result of the past few weeks.'' This indicated prolonged haggling over whether <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who turns 76 on Thursday, would give up the party leadership he held nearly 32 years. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s new post would let him use his vast experience in international affairs _ an indication that <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> expects <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> to keep out of day-to-day internal politics. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was dropped from the Politburo along with seven other party veterans in Sunday's reshuffle. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said it is important that the new 11-member Politburo include such people as <PERSON> Reszo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, the father of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic reforms in the 1960s, and <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, another outspoken advocate of political reform As premier, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> pushed stringent measures to curb <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s 18 percent inflation rate and $ 18 billion foreign debt. But he admitted the austerity measures so far failed to halt stagnation. A new party policy statement approved on Sunday advocates more foreign investment, joint ventures and loosening restrictions on the ownership of foreign capital. It calls for changes allowing Hungarians a greater voice in economic and political affairs, including a major expansion of private initiatives. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic crisis with the attendant loss of confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> prompted the birth of many independent interest groups, demanding a voice.

<HEAD>House-Passed Bill Would Block Military Exports To Terrorist

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is moving forward with legislation that could prevent another Iran-Contra affair by establishing precise rules governing when a president must tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of dealings with terrorist countries. In the latest attempt to turn the lessons learned from the affair into law, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday approved by voice vote a bill designed chiefly to prevent exports of military equipment to terrorist nations, like <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But the legislation, sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, permits the president to deal with such countries if he believes the national interest is at stake _ and if he adheres to strict notification requirements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Since the bill permits the president some flexibility, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration does not oppose the legislation, according to administration foreign policy supporter Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>. The House bill is the second major attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to avoid another Iran-Contra affair. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year passed a bill, which is still pending in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, that would require the president to notify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of any covert intelligence operation within 48 hours after its authorization. Current law merely provides for timely notification. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration considers that requirement too rigid and opposes the legislation. The new House bill requires notification to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a much broader array of circumstances than just covert actions. The coverage would include transfer of weapons and foreign aid money, which may or may not be secret. In the Iran-Contra affair, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he had authorized the sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> until after the secret operation was revealed in a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> publication. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is one of six nations designated by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist country. The other countries are <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Current law is supposed to prevent such weapons sales, but failed to do so. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, a member of the former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> committee, called the bill `` one of the thoughtful responses to the Iran-Contra hearings. `` One of the big problems -LRB- in the Iran-Contra affair -RRB- was the transfer of weapons to the Iranians and nobody knew about it,'' he said. `` In this bill, the president still has his constitutional power to execute his foreign policy functions.'' The latest bill would prohibit any American from exporting arms to a terrorist state, whether the individual is a government employee, a private citizen or someone acting on behalf of the government. The secret network that controlled weapons sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and use of some profits to aid the Nicaraguan Contras was directed by former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. He, in turn, enlisted two businessmen to run the logistics of the operations: <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. Under the legislation, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would form its list of terrorist nations by determining whether a country repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism or granted sanctuary to international terrorists. The president could delete a nation from the list. But he must report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that a fundamental change in leadership and character has taken place, that the country has not supported international terrorism for the preceding six months, and that government provided assurances it would not support future acts of terrorism. The deletion could not take place until 30 days after the report was submitted. The legislation would require a validated license before goods or technology could be exported to terrorist states, if such exports would significantly contribute to the military potential of the country or enhance its ability to support terrorism. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> must notify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> 30 days before issuing a validated license. The president would be able to waive export restrictions for national security reasons, and could provide foreign assistance to a terrorist nation for humanitarian purposes. But first, the president must give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a 15-day advance notification, and a report containing all the details of the proposed transaction. The legislation would retain current penalties for violating restrictions on exports or aid to terrorist countries: a maximum of $ 1 million in fines and 10 years in prison for criminal violations, and up to $ 500,000 for civil penalties.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will make new proposals at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit to keep track of elusive mobile missiles in a move to complete a treaty sharply reducing strategic nuclear arsenals, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. So far, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators have been unable to find ways to count the missiles that would be left on both sides if stockpiles are slashed. This, in turn, keeps the superpowers from deciding whether to include mobile missiles in an arms reduction treaty. While verification is extremely difficult, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is not ready to insist on banning the elusive weapons and give up hope of retaining some of these potent long-range missiles in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` They are harder to find, so they are more survivable and therefore do n't invite a first strike,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told news agency reporters in a pre-summit interview. `` So that adds something to stability.'' But he acknowledged their elusiveness poses an extreme problem for arms control. `` So you have to find a balance, a compromise,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Negotiations on a new treaty are stymied over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-missile program, known popularly as Star Wars, and over verifying reductions in mobile missiles and cruise missiles carried on fighter planes and warships. The treaty is supposed to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent. At the same time, the two sides want to devise foolproof ways of verifying weapons are not retained illegally. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> had already proposed some ideas on how to keep track of mobile missiles. At the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, he said, `` We will propose additional ones that refine things and give them more detail.'' He said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration also would pursue at the summit a system for sending observers to suspect sites with little advance warning. While the treaty can not be completed in time for the summit, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said there was still a chance of finishing it before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next January. `` It's possible,'' he said. `` I do n't know whether it will actually happen or not. There are very knowledgeable people on both sides working to bring it about. But the problems are very difficult.'' And yet, he said the Soviets evidently want to keep at it, instead of waiting for the next administration to take over. `` They are in a negotiating process with people who are knowledgeable, competent, and are engaged,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` So they, as we, want to make as much progress as is possible.''

<HEAD>Administration Supports Denying Convicted Drug Smugglers Their
Passports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> says there is widespread support in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for legislation that would separate convicted narcotics smugglers from their passports. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> made the comment as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked congressional leaders on Tuesday for help in creating a bipartisan task force on drugs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has asked that the task force lay out its proposals in a report to him and the congressional leadership within 45 days. One proposal it will almost certainly examine involves additional penalties for passport holders involved with drugs. Currently, passports can be seized as evidence if someone is found to be smuggling narcotics into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But there is no penalty provision to deny convicted narcotics offenders their passports. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he believes a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet-level </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which he heads, favors legislation to enact such a penalty. He said legislation is being contemplated and that `` we will be proposing a lot of ideas in the course of these meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> named White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and national security advisor <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> as well as <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to the task force. To date, no members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have been named to the panel. Some members had criticized the proposal as offering more bureaucracy, rather than concrete steps to battle the problem. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, however, said congressional leaders emphasized the need to move quickly and there will be further discussions in the next few days. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also told reporters there is `` no softening whatsoever'' of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's `` zero tolerance'' anti-drug policy, despite modifications under which the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> will be more cautious about seizing boats outside the 12-mile limit. Under the administration's zero tolerance policy, law enforcement agencies are cracking down on illegal drug use, no matter how small the amount. With the new changes, however, vessels outside the 12-mile limit found to contain drugs will be seized only when there is evidence of intent to smuggle them into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There have been some operational refinements, but the policy remains the same,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. `` Zero tolerance continues to be our policy both inside and outside the 12-mile limit,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. But the attorney general acknowledged that federal law `` outside 12 miles does relate to quantities of narcotics indicating an intent to traffic in or smuggle.'' One idea that has been jettisoned by the Cabinet-level drug policy board, according to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, is the proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to shoot down planes carrying drug smugglers. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> declined to discuss specific anti-drug proposals Customs has made to the drug policy board, but did call for an all-out fight against drugs. `` You must treat it like a war _ total mobilization, total commitment,'' he told the newspaper. `` When you fight a war, every man, woman and child should be mobilized to that effort.''

<HEAD>Length of Hospital Stays Declines Since 1980</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The length of the average hospital stay has dropped since 1980, creating both real and `` false'' savings, a researcher for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> says. The average number of days patients spent in hospitals declined from 11 percent to 15 percent in the early 1980s, said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, deputy research manager of the Hospital Studies Program in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>. Although the decline has reduced health care costs for individuals, the government and insurers, `` in a sense there's a false sense of savings,'' he said Tuesday. `` While patients are staying a shorter period in the hospitals they are going elsewhere and recuperating,'' he said. `` Hospitals are reducing their costs,'' he said. `` Insurers and the government are saving money, but patients still need nursing care'' and they usually get it from family members, he said. The average hospital stay declined from 7.35 days in 1980 to 5.71 days in 1985, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which reported on the findings in today's editions. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said the decline has occurred even though hospitals are tending to admit patients who are sicker and who therefore stay longer. But for some specific medical conditions the length of stay has been shortened, he said. He cited the example of women who used to be admitted to hospitals for stays of three to five days for normal delivery of babies now being discharged one or two days after delivery. `` The decline has been very substantial and what has happened is that people -LRB- who once were admitted for -RRB- relatively short stays are n't getting into the hospitals,'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said. Instead, he said, they are treated as outpatients. He said hospitals reacted to policies put in place by insurers and public agencies that believed hospital usage was excessive, but he said the decline now presents a problem of excess capacity. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> attributed the decline in hospital stays to several factors, he said. They include changes in reimbursement by government insurance programs like <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, a shift toward outpatient care, increased use of second opinions, changes in the ways hospitals are competing for patients, growth in health maintenance organizations and other prepaid insurance and `` selective contracting'' by insurers who shop around among hospitals on the basis of costs. He said the decline may be contributing to some hospital closings. `` It's not unusual to have them operating at 50 -LRB- percent -RRB- to 60 percent on average,'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said. He said hospitals face the challenge of what to do with the excess space. `` The state of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> was actively discussing about a year and a half to two years ago how to eliminate 20 percent of the hospital beds in the state,'' he said. `` I think those kinds of discussions are taking place all over the country.'' But <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said the decline is leveling off. `` Lengths of stay have fallen as much as they are going to for a while but there are some questions in terms of caseloads and the kinds of patients that they are going to treat,'' he said.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Speaks Out Against Legalizing Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says the legalization of drugs would amount to an admission that protecting young people is too much trouble. `` We are hearing this cry not because Americans want to accept the costs of drug use but because some are afraid we can not win this fight and that the cost of maintaining the war against drugs has become too great,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told a convention of drug counselors Tuesday. He called talk of legalizing drugs `` a new development that may pull the rug out from under our efforts'' to stop drugs. `` Many of those calling for legalization point to the example of alcohol consumption, as if legalized cocaine, for example, would be no worse,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` That is not the point. ... Legalizing drugs, even if such legalization were designed to prevent access to those substances by young people, would almost certainly instead expand it.'' He said the war against drugs has been difficult, but that he ca n't believe society is ready to say: `` It's too much trouble to protect our young people from drugs. The use of the military would cause some difficulties; more law enforcement would mean spending more; sound education is too much of a burden; it's just too much trouble for us adults to fulfill our basic responsibilities, so let's open it up and let our kids take their chances.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> spoke at the second annual conference on drug-free schools. `` No videotape, no matter how useful, and no curricular package, no matter how well conceived, can substitute for the action and example of educators, parents and other adults in the community who teach young people the lesson that drug use is wrong,'' he said. `` Schools need clear policies against the use and sale of drugs. The most effective policies call for suspension of students caught using drugs and harsher penalties for those who sell drugs. ... In order to prevent drug use form expanding, a user must be treated firmly, so that he can not involve non-users and so that his own drug use ceases.''

<HEAD>Plant Closing Fight Goes Back 15 Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Reagan-Trade Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Labor unions have been trying unsuccessfully for 15 years to require businesses to give employees notice of upcoming plant closings and large-scale layoffs. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the trade bill on Tuesday is just the latest chapter in a tale that dates back to December 1973, when then-Sen. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., offered the first version of plant closing <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> offered the measure after a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> plant closing that put 1,200 employees on the street on short notice with a seriously underfunded pension plan. Import competition was not the problem. The company was moving its operations to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Mich., introduced a similar measure in the House a few months later, citing similar problems in his district Since then, labor supporters of the concept and business groups that oppose it have butted heads with few results. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, the Business Roundtable and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> contend the plant-closing provisions would tie management's hands and represent a first step in the `` Europeanization'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry and could bring the heavy jobless levels that afflict some European economies. Proponents scoff at such claims as pure scare talk. They point to West German and Japanese plant-closings laws already on the books and note that companies there are outpacing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rivals in the competitiveness race. They also cite studies by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> which show that about half of American workers who are laid off get a week's notice or less `` Advance notice helps workers because it warns them that their jobs are in danger before they find themselves out of work and on the street,'' says one major supporter, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. The plant closing provision in the trade bill is one of hundreds of features primarily aimed at turning around the nation's trade deficit. But it has come to overshadow the other provisions amid increasingly stern warnings from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that it would guarantee a veto of the entire bill. The provision is simple enough. It would require any company with 100 employees or more to give 60 days notice of impending plant closings or layoffs affecting at least 100 workers. There are exceptions for firms in serious financial difficulties. Like supporters of the measure, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says plant-closings notification are `` the humane thing to do.'' `` I support voluntarily giving workers and communities as much advance warning as possible when a layoff or closing becomes necessary. ... It is the humane thing to do,'' he said in his veto message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I object to the idea that the federal government would arbitrarily mandate, for all conditions and under all circumstances, exactly when and in what form that notification should take place,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` There are many circumstances under which such mandatory notification would actually force a faltering business to close _ by driving away creditors, suppliers, customers, and in the process destroying jobs.'' He cited the experience of the <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1980s, which, he said, had to use layoffs and temporary plant closings to respond to competitive developments. `` As one executive of that company stated, they did not have the luxury then, nor do they now, of knowing with certainty what business conditions would be like 60 days in the future,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Without the ability to be agile and responsive, they might have closed their doors permanently.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, on the eve of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s departure for the superpower summit, called on the president and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to look beyond military solutions to the world's problems. `` The president goes to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, frustrated in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The general secretary receives him, defeated in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' the Democratic presidential contender told a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> luncheon here Tuesday. `` The most powerful nations of the world confounded in seeking to control poor small nations on or near their borders.'' `` After a certain point, there is less and less relationship between military prowess and the ability to achieve political objectives,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the group. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was leaving this morning for <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, where he will remain until he flies to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday for the start of the May 29-June 2 summit. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would adopt a no-first-use policy on nuclear weapons and conduct talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on bilateral reductions of conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And he called for U.S.-Soviet cooperation in tackling the problems of hunger and poverty around the globe. He noted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal that the superpowers work together on an exploration of Mars, and suggested that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reciprocate `` by suggesting a joint project to eradicate disease in the Third World.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also urged an end to the military buildup <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has presided over. `` After the largest military buildup in our history, we must change our course or lose our way,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Earlier this week, he released a five-year budget plan that called for a freeze in military spending. `` Invest that money to educate our children, provide health care to our parents, and protect our environment. This is not an act of charity; it is a necessary part of defending our real security,'' he said. Later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appeared at an anti-apartheid rally outside the South African consulate. He repeated his call for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to be designated a terrorist state, and said he would urge that the proposal be made part of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform. `` We have a moral obligation to put <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the loop of terror, to free people from this tyranny and gain our moral authority in this world,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also hinted that his Democratic rival, front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, has not taken a sufficient interest in the issue. `` He is not very conversant on our options in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. `` When we talk about it in more detail, Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will see it as a terrorist state.''

<HEAD>Signs That Chemotherapy May Help Control Lung Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors reported finding the first tentative evidence that chemotherapy may be able to help control lung cancer, the nation's leading cancer killer. Four studies presented at a medical conference produce at least a hint that platinum-based drugs, combined with radiation and sometimes surgery, may help prolong patients' survival. None of the research suggests anything close to a cure for lung cancer, but doctors are encouraged by any improvement in a disease in which survival is measured in months, rather than years. `` There is no effective therapy for the vast majority of patients,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Capizzi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. He said this makes the latest research, presented Tuesday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oncology </ORGANIZATION>, potentially important. `` There is the possibility that drugs may, for some subset of patients, have important effects,'' he said. `` We do n't have a prescription to be offered to the masses. We have important new leads for controlled clinical trials.'' About 150,000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year. The four studies were conducted on people with non-small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about three-quarters of all cases. The most encouraging results were presented by Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Like the other studies, his was conducted on people whose cancer was too extensive to be removed surgically but had not spread beyond the chest. Typically, such people are treated with radiation, which slows but does not stop the disease. He treated 240 patients with radiation and chemotherapy or with radiation alone. He estimated that half of the patients receiving the combination would still be alive after one year, compared with one-third of those who got only radiation. `` Our study is the first to show that chemotherapy may help at all in non-small cell lung cancer,'' <PERSON> Dillman </PERSON> said. While the treatment may represent an advance, he said, `` this is not going to be enough. More clinical trials will be needed to improve survival in this disease.'' Dr. <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, conducted a similar study using different chemotherapy drugs. However, in this attempt, the drugs did not help people live longer. `` We were not able to influence the outcomes by chemotherapy in addition to radiation,'' he said. The other studies used chemotherapy plus radiation to shrink tumors so they could be removed surgically. In one, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, doctors were able to completely remove tumors from 10 of 41 patients treated. He said the patients' median survival is 17 months, and `` there is a suggestion that this approach might be associated with longer survival.''

<HEAD>Small Cracks Found in Some Older Boeing 737s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is preparing a formal regulation that could require the metal skin of older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s to be strengthened and reinforced, the agency's administrator, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, says The proposed regulation is expected to be formally announced within a week. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>'s comments on Tuesday came in the wake of last month's in-flight breakup of an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 A flight attendant was swept to her death when a 20-foot section of the plane tore away. The pilots managed to bring the aircraft to a safe landing, but 61 people were injured. The Aloha plane was 19 years old and had made nearly 89,000 landings. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials also reported on Tuesday that a special inspection of 96 older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s, begun after that accident, found small cracks in one of every nine aircraft but none of a magnitude that they are cause for alarm. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for aviation standards, said that of the 96 planes inspected under the order, 10 were found to have some cracks, the largest of which was one-fourth of an inch. He said none of the cracks should be considered `` alarming.'' Investigators believe that a 20-foot section of the forward cabin wall and roof tore away from the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 during April 28 flight because of a structural failure stemming from cracking and corrosion. A week after the incident, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directed that all <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s with 30,000 or more landings undergo a special visual inspection and those with more than 50,000 landings be subject to additional inspections using high-frequency electronic equipment. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, there are 373 of the 737s worldwide with 30,000 or more landings, 212 of which operate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and are subject to the FAA-required inspections.

<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been summoned before the legislature to report on negotiations with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials over the nation's lengthy political crisis. The move on Tuesday by the pro-Noriega <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> would allow <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader to present his position without appearing to take the initiative in divulging details of the talks. By a 39-7 vote with five abstentions, the 67-member body summoned <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to appear before it within 48 hours. The chief of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the nation's de facto leader, did not immediately respond. A similar move failed in the assembly on Monday when 27 of 47 legislators present voted for it. Passage required a two-thirds majority of those present. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed a wide array of economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to force the ouster of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was indicted in February on federal drug smuggling charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials want <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign his post and leave the country at least temporarily. If <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> appears before the legislature, he will be asked what <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> negotiators have proposed, what <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> negotiators are trying to achieve, and why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is taking part in the talks if it does not recognize the Noriega-controlled government of President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. The White House's chief negotiator, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, has been meeting with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> representatives for nearly a month to try to resolve the crisis. He returned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Monday after a brief trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. While a deal has been reported near on several occasions by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sources, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has said in several recent appearances that he will not leave unless <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> economic sanctions are lifted and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` aggression'' ends. About 2,000 American troops have been sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in recent weeks to back up the 10,000 soldiers already here assigned to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also has said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must `` respect'' the presidency of <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, who took over the presidency Feb. 26 after President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and was deposed by the general's supporters. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the legitimate president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, is in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. There is a warrant out for his arrest. <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON>, president of the pro-military <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told local television stations on Tuesday that the crisis would be resolved if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lifts the sanctions. `` In five minutes,'' he said, `` the problem would be settled.'' <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON>, who has represented <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also said: `` We have totally rejected the fact that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has to leave the country.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has denied the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug smuggling charges, which he contends are a political ploy to replace him with a less nationalistic leader who might tolerate a prolonged American military presence. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reportedly is considering dropping the indictments if it would lead to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure from power, a position that has sharply divided his administration.

<HEAD>Prostitute Says Swaggart Had Sex With Her</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A prostitute claims she and television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had sexual intercourse and he wanted her 9-year-old daughter to watch sex acts but she refused, <PERSON> Penthouse </PERSON> magazine reports. The article in the July issue is the first to report that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> engaged in sexual intercourse during any of the alleged sexual encounters that led to his removal from the pulpit by the Assemblies of God church April 8. In previous reports, the prostitute, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> paid her to perform lewd acts while he watched in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> area motel last year. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, head of the Baton Rouge-based <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, stopped preaching for three months but returned to the pulpit Sunday without credentials from the Assemblies, the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination The Penthouse interview is accompanied by explicit photos in which <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON> demonstrates the acts she said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> asked her to perform. She said she had at least 20 encounters with him during a one-year period. The issue containing the article is scheduled to go on sale in June, but some copies were sold here Tuesday. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has never admitted a sexual encounter, but said from the pulpit Feb. 1 that he was guilty of a sin against his family. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON>, an attorney for the ministries, refused to comment on the Penthouse article. `` We will have no comment about that ever,'' <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON> said. In April, The National Enquirer supermarket tabloid decided not to use an interview with <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON> after she failed a lie detector test about her allegations. She blamed the polygraph results on her use of cocaine the day before the test was administered. Penthouse planned to pay the 28-year-old <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON> for the interview and pictures, but <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>, the magazine's director of public relations, would not disclose the amount. In the article, <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON> claimed that she and <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had brief sexual intercourse once, and that she performed oral sex on <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> more than once. She said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was unwilling most times to pay her the going rate of `` $ 30 or $ 40'' for oral sex. `` God, what a freak! <PERSON> Kinky </PERSON>! Here he is up there preaching for all this money, and when I see him, he's kinky and cheap, too,'' she said. She said she refused <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s request that she have her 9-year-old daughter watch sex acts. `` I said, ` You can do whatever turns you on but do n't ever mention my daughter again,' `` the magazine quoted her as saying. <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON> has three children living with her parents in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. She has an arrest record in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, mainly involving prostitution charges.

<TEXT>
 The government today expressed relief after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed an omnibus trade bill that provides for sanctions against a Japanese company and countries who violate international trade agreements. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s relief was qualified, however, by a vote overriding the veto in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and the reasons behind <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, speaking to reporters at his official residence, welcomed the veto. `` Concern now is primarily on domestic issues in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said. `` When the negotiations -LRB- between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- begin, the issues most affecting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will be brought out.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s minister of international trade and industry, <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, told a news conference: `` Our ministry has in the past requested efforts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government to see that the trade bill would not be enacted, and we welcome President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto. Opposition to the bill in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> stems mainly from provisions requiring retaliation against violations of international trade pacts and other `` unjustifiable'' practices. If enacted, the bill would transfer from the president to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative the authority to decide what unfair trade practices another country is engaged in and what, if any, retaliatory measures to impose. A provision imposing sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and one of its subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for the subsidiary's sales of sensitive equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also concerns <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto message made no mention of the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> sanctions. The message focused on curbs on exports of Alaskan oil and a mandatory requirement forcing businesses to give employees advance warning of closures or layoffs. <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sold the Soviets milling machines that could be used to make submarine propellers quieter and more difficult to detect. The sales violated international rules regulating trade between the West and communist countries. <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> said he hopes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will support <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and that the bill will not pass. `` But for us foreigners it is very hard to say what will happen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he added. The House overrode the veto with a margin well above the two-thirds majority required, but it was thought unlikely that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would go along when it considers the override after next week's Memorial Day recess.

 <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s race for governor, rocked by the sudden withdrawal of the incumbent and the unexpected death of his chief opponent, has left the state with a jumble of more candidates than it has seen in 16 years. The remaining candidates in the June 7 primary include <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s attorney general, who is trying to overcome a drunken-driving conviction; a former governor; a former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice; three past and present legislators; a drug addict-turned-preacher and a tax protester Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON>'s decision last summer not to seek a third term, saying he wanted concentrate more on his farm and family, opened doors for candidates who had been unwilling to take on the popular incumbent. Then, in early April, a plane crash killed the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> front-runner, Secretary of State <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltermire </PERSON>, leaving his supporters with a dilemma over which of the two remaining <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contenders to back. The common thread running through the eight-man campaign for governor, the most crowded since 1972, has been economic development, with the candidates offering ideas for infusing new life into <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s lackluster economy. The two Republican candidates, former state Sen. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> and state Rep. <LOCATION> Cal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Winslow </LOCATION>, are vying for the chance to end the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 20-year reign in the governor's chair. Both men have legislative backgrounds; <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> has logged 16 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Winslow </LOCATION> has served eight years in House. But the similarities end there. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, 58, has attracted support from the mainstream of the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, collecting support from former party leaders and longtime <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officeholders. He boasts of his experience in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leadership positions and as a successful businessman from northern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON>, 38, has appealed to the younger elements of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, portraying himself as a conduit for attracting new business to the state. The six Democratic candidates include three serious contenders. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Judge </PERSON>, who was governor from 1973 to 1981, is attempting a comeback after losing in the 1980 Democratic primary to <LOCATION> Schwinden </LOCATION>. The 53-year-old investment adviser has built his campaign on experience and an elaborate economic development plan. `` I wo n't need four years of on-the-job training,'' he has said, boasting of the state's lucrative economy during his two terms as governor. Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Greely </PERSON>, 48, overcame the stigma of a 1986 drunken-driving conviction to enter the race. He's called for a more aggressive program for marketing <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> products elsewhere. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who resigned as a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice last year to run, has emerged as the candidate most vehemently opposed to a retail sales tax. Seen as the most liberal of the Democrats, the 50-year-old <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> has political roots in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, where his father was a three-term governor. The other Democratic candidates are <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, a little-known state senator and farmer; <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> `` Curly'' <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, a traveling evangelist who preaches on the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse based on his own past addictions; and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> `` Red'' <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON>, a tax protester and author.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has filed objections with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> about a union vote by white-collar workers, charging that organizers used illegal tactics to gain a slim victory. The university action Tuesday was ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> officials claimed workers were `` intimidated or coerced'' as they voted May 17 in favor of unionizing. A union officer said <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> was `` stretching it'' with the charges and had no evidence to prove the claim. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s 3,300 clerical and technical staff members voted by a 44-vote majority to make the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clerical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> their negotiating body. The <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> school fought the union drive with flyers, in-house meetings with supervisors and public statements. The union drive was closely watched by national labor leaders as a benchmark for organizing white-collar workers. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s prestige and the bitterness of the fight between the university and the union drew national media attention. `` <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> worked very hard to ensure that staff members would be permitted to vote on May 17 in a fair and lawful process, without being intimidated or coerced,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who coordinated <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s response to the union drive. `` There is some evidence that the union did not share this principle.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said 41 of those who voted for the union were ineligible to vote because of their jobs status. As a result, she said, the actual margin could have been as small as three votes. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> charged that union representatives maintained lists of voters, interrogated workers at the polls, campaigned near polling places, escorted workers to voting places and pressured union opponents not to vote. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s filing of the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> claim drew a rebuke from <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> McEntee </PERSON>, national president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, to which the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> union belongs. He called the charges `` an insult to the thousands of university employees who participated in this free and open election and an insult to the entire labor movement. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> has flunked its fairness report card.'' Chief union organizer <PERSON> Kristine </PERSON> <PERSON> Rondeau </PERSON> questioned the charge that she and others intimidated workers. `` I do n't think that I could intimidate a fly,'' <PERSON> Rondeau </PERSON> said. `` It's really stretching it.'' <PERSON> Rondeau </PERSON> said the university issued a questionnaire to the more than 3,300 workers Tuesday asking whether they noticed any pressure by the union on election day. She denied that the union pressured anyone. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, assistant regional director for the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION>, said the board's policy has been to conduct union elections in `` laboratory conditions,'' as free from pressure as possible. The <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> could take from a month to more than a year to review <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s charges, he said. `` From the union's standpoint, the worst that could happen is that they have to run the election over again,'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill To Restrict Use Of Boat-Hull Paint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has approved legislation to restrict the use of a popular boat-hull paint that is effective against marine organisms like barnacles but which poses environmental risks. The bill, approved by voice vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, would ban the use of paints containing organic tin additives on non-aluminum hull vessels less than 82 feet long. The most widely used additive is tributyltin, or TBT. The measure would permit continued use of such paints on large vessels and those with aluminum hulls so long as the organic tin compounds are not released into the water at more than 4 micrograms per square centimeter a day. Paints with organic tin are much more effective against barnacles and marine algae than copper-based paints, meaning lower maintenance costs for boat owners. But testimony in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said those paints can remain toxic for up to six months when released into the water.

 At least 20,000 people fled in panic when a 40-foot-tall kerosene tank caught fire at an oil tank farm in this northern city, threatening adjacent tanks. It was 10 hours before residents could return home. No serious injuries were reported in Tuesday's blaze at the storage facility operated by the government oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> in a residential area. Authorities said some firefighters suffered minor burns in the eight hours it took for them to bring the inferno under control. About 900,000 gallons of kerosene were in the steel tank when it ignited in an explosion at about 10:10 a.m. -LRB- 12:10 p.m. EDT -RRB-. The government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said area residents had been protesting the tank farm's presence and the tanks were to have been relocated months ago, but new facilities have not been completed. The conflagration threatened 14 other tanks on the farm that were filled with millions of gallons of gasoline. Fire and smoke spiraled more than 150 feet above the plant. Fearing the worst, authorities evacuated people living around the plant. One estimate said as many as 200,000 people fled their homes. `` There were all kinds of accidents in the road. The whole city was running -LRB- away from the site -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 26, who works at the plant. `` You could see the flames and black smoke from miles away.'' <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, 230 miles south of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has 550,000 residents and is the capital of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, the largest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 31 states The cause of the fire was under investigation, but company officials said maintenance work was going on at the time of the explosion. `` What we do know is that two men were soldering to repair a line at the base of the tank and that the top part exploded,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> <PERSON> Coronado </PERSON>, a plant spokesman. `` There was an explosion but it was very muffled, and then the fire started,'' said plant foreman <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> workers and firefighters used water and foam to douse the blaze and cool off a nearby gasoline tank scorched by the flames. `` The danger lasted about five hours,'' <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON> said. `` It was a question of cooling off the other tank.'' <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said four tanks were `` very close'' to the burning tank. It quoted the local fire chief as saying soldiers, police and volunteers evacuated more than 100,000 people from a two-mile radius around the plant. <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> later gave its own estimate of 200,000 people evacuated and said hundreds of soldiers and rescue workers helped in the effort. Reporters at the newspaper Novedades de <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> placed the number of evacuees at 20,000. City police spokesman <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said it could only be estimated that `` several thousands'' of residents were evacuated from the nearby working-class and middle-class neighborhoods. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> officials at the site said the tank that burned had a capacity of 1.2 million gallons and was three-fourths full. The other tanks on the farm contained regular and premium gasoline. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> radio dispatcher <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojo </PERSON> said efforts to control the blaze were initially hampered by a scarcity of water. Much of northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is suffering from drought this season. On Nov. 19, 1984, more than 500 people were killed at an explosion of storage tanks owned by <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ixhuatepec </LOCATION>, a working class neighborhood on the northern outskirts of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The disaster led to heated debate about locating oil and industrial complexes near residential neighborhoods.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters, accusing party regulars in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> of plotting against them, are threatening a boycott of next week's state Republican convention. `` By not participating in a process designed to abuse our delegates, we believe we are today making a positive protest that we hope will help deter similar behavior in the future,'' <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, the state chairman of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s organization, said Tuesday.

<HEAD>Dollar Inactive, Stocks Post Healthy Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar closed little changed today in trading against the Japanese yen, while stock prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> posted a healthy gain following the overnight advance on Wall Street. After opening the day at 124.20 yen, the dollar climbed slightly and ended the day at 124.30 yen, up 0.05 yen from Tuesday's finish. `` The dollar stayed stable throughout the day, ranging between 124.15 and 124.33 yen in mixed trading,'' said a dealer with a major commercial bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity. There was some dollar-selling by trading houses that pulled the currency down a little, but it climbed back again on speculative buying by financial institutions, he said. `` There was also apprehensions over possible market intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> to support the dollar, which prevented participants to make major moves,'' the dealer said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank, however, did not step into the market, he said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which gained a small 62.90 points Tuesday, won 130.99 points, or 0.47 percent, to close the day's trading at 27,443.65. `` The overnight rise on Wall Street made investors confident,'' said <PERSON> Hiromi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoneyama </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wako </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Share prices were firm almost across the board supported by strong buying mood by institutional, foreign, as well as individual investors, he said. Investors who have been concerned about rising interest rates and booming inflation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are now less pessimistic about the future of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, he added. Trading was heavy, led by large-capital issues such as steels and heavy industries, said traders. Volume on the first section trading wa estimated at 1.5 billion shares, up from 1.1 billion shares Tuesday. Other than large-capital issues, shipbuildings, automobiles, chemicals, machineries and real estates were higher. Certain electricals and precision machineries lost ground.

<HEAD>Voter Decide Congressional Primaries In Kentucky, Idaho</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Three Democratic congressmen were expected to sail to victory in November after walloping opponents in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> primaries, one of them dubbed the nation's nastiest, as <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> held contests in its two congressional districts. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s 1st District, incumbent Rep. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> traded charges of incompetence and unethical conduct with challenger <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in perhaps the most heated primary on the ballot Tuesday. `` The people have not only said yes to <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, but they have said no, a loud no, to the type of campaigning that we've seen in this race,'' the 50-year-old congressman said after receiving 73 percent of the vote in the most bitterly contested race. With all but four of the district's 491 precincts reporting unofficial returns, <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> received 62,251 votes to 22,828 votes, or 27 percent, for <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 48-year-old businessman who moved from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to seek <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>'s seat. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> called <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> a carpetbagger and questioned his dedication to his recently acquired Baptist faith. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> of incompetence and improperly investigating a loan <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had received. Roll Call, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> weekly that calls itself `` the newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' had labeled the campaign `` the nastiest in the country.'' The two other incumbent Democratic congressmen facing primary opposition, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON> in the 2nd District and <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> in the 3rd District, also won easy renomination. In the state's 3rd District, which covers <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, nine-term incumbent <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> health services executive and former television news reporter, after a campaign in which <PERSON> Hutter </PERSON> claimed that <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> had done little for the district despite his seniority. <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> received 31,288 votes, or 61 percent, to 20,207 votes, or 39 percent, for <PERSON> Hutter </PERSON> with all 350 precincts reporting unofficial results. Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunnagan </PERSON> easily won the Republican nomination against two perennial candidates. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON>, who has represented the 2nd District since 1953, defeated <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a farmer whom <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON> beat by 79 percent to 21 percent in the primary two years ago. With all 414 precincts reporting unofficial returns, <PERSON> Natcher </PERSON> had 26,918 votes, or 76 percent, to 8,319 votes, or 24 percent, for <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. Republicans selected former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunnagan </PERSON> to carry their banner in the 3rd District in the fall. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tori </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Radcliff </PERSON> was unopposed for the Republican nomination in the 2nd District. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, state Rep. <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>, a full-blooded <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> d'Alene Indian, manufactured a huge victory over <ORGANIZATION> Bonners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferry </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION> apartment manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> for the Democratic nomination to face four-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Congressman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> in the 1st District. With 73 percent of the 418 precincts reporting, Mrs. <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> had 63 percent to <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>'s 21 percent and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s 16 percent. Voters in the conservative 2nd District of southern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> gave former state Sen. <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination to challenge two-term Democratic Congressman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> in the fall. With 68 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had 58 percent and political novice <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> had 42 percent. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, attention centered on the Democratic contests, whose winners were expected to be heavy favorites in November in the heavily <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> districts. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> faces independent candidate <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatchett </PERSON> in November. The incumbent had not faced serious opposition in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s 1st Congressional District, which covers the state's westernmost counties, since ousting incumbent <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubblefield </PERSON> in the 1974 primary <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, his opponent, admitted that the carpetbagger image hurt him badly. `` I think that he created enough of a question about my commitment to western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>State A.G. To Seek Contempt Charges Against Brawley's Mother</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents of 10th graf, `The 16-year-old ...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state attorney general said he will seek contempt-of-court charges against the mother of a black teen-ager who claims she was abducted and raped by a group of white men. Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said Tuesday he found it ironic that dozens of friends, neighbors and acquaintances of <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> will talk to investigators, but that the teen-ager's own family continues to resist the probe. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, has defied a subpoena to tell a grand jury investigating the case about her daughter's allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of six white men. The Brawleys say the incident was racially motivated. `` The strategy of defiance and non-cooperation on the part of the family and their representatives continues to impede our investigation from learning the full story of what happened to <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> called the situation `` unfortunate and regrettable,'' and said the blame must be shared by the Brawleys' representatives, attorneys <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, and the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> have called <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> racists, and insisted that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> step aside as special prosecutor in the case. Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> talked about her daughter's case on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> radio station Tuesday at the same time she had been summoned to appear before the grand jury here. `` I could not get any justice, so I went to the black community and I got all the power that I need to back me to help me to fight for my daughter,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who was interviewed on station <ORGANIZATION> WLIB </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON>'s stepfather, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, and the family's advisers <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said they are eager to explain the reasons for defying the subpoena. A hearing on the contempt allegation will be sometime next week, said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' spokesman <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON>. The 16-year-old Wappingers Falls girl was missing for four days before she was found Nov. 28 in a dazed state with racial epithets and excrement smeared on her body. She said that white men, one of them with a badge, had abducted and raped her. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> has refused to cooperate with investigators. Her only statements about what happened have come through her family. Authorities have not be able to find evidence to corroborate her story. After allegations by attorneys for Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> that local investigators could not be impartial, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> assigned the case to <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. If found in contempt, Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> could be jailed for up to 30 days or fined $ 250, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said.

 Despite assurances of better services, voters in several resort communities decided against forming the city of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> after casinos helped wage a vigorous advertising campaign against the move. The vote Tuesday was 1,001 against and 802 for the plan. The issue prompted an unusually high turnout of 60 percent, said <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Clerk <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. She said a normal turnout was 35-40 percent. The proposed city, with a population of about 6,500, would have embraced the casino area of <LOCATION> Stateline </LOCATION> and smaller communities along about 15 miles of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>'s southeastern shore. The proposal lost in all the lakeshore communities, although proponents had argued that the communities, which make up 25 percent of <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s population, do not receive a proportionate share in services of the 60 percent in tax revenue they contribute. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nino </PERSON>, leader of the opposition, said he was very pleased with the vote, adding, `` We believed there was going to be a substantial tax increase. People will pay more for more but we did n't see where there was going to be more. We saw the same or less.'' The opposition received financial support from the <LOCATION> Stateline </LOCATION> casinos, whose tax burden <PERSON> Nino </PERSON> said would rise by at least $ 300,000 yearly under a city government. `` The tax scare did it,'' admitted <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bigham </PERSON>, a leader of the movement to create the city. `` I think that did us in, perhaps along with mixing it with the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>.'' Opponents also argued there would be fewer or no state trooper patrols in the area if the city was created. `` The ads that came out in the paper were rather overwhelming,'' <PERSON> Bigham </PERSON> said. `` While we had some good editorials in the paper, and some people sponsored their own ads for the city, we just did n't have the money to spend on it that the opposition did. Commissioners of <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which would lose about $ 1.8 million in yearly tax revenue to the city, mostly from the big <LOCATION> Stateline </LOCATION> casinos, had advised voters to reject the plan. Communities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, on the western side of the lake, also had complained about the plan, saying the name <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Tahoe </PERSON> would create confusion between the lake and the city.

<HEAD>Thousands Evacuated After Propane Tanker Ignites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEAFORD, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of evacuated residents waited to return home today while many others faced commuting headaches as propane from an overturned tank truck burned for a second day. The fire was so intense, and potentially explosive, that firefighters were prevented from approaching the burning truck loaded with about 2,500 gallons of propane. Instead, unmanned pumpers threw water on the blaze. Officials estimated that the fire could burn for as long as 30 hours, or until about 3:30 p.m. today, if no explosion occurred. About 2,000 families were evacuated from within half a mile of the accident and taken to a nearby church, said <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police spokesman. <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Krausch </PERSON> said the truck overturned Tuesday morning on the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway after the driver experienced a problem with the truck's rear wheels. A section of the highway and of another nearby road were closed, and the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> was forced to suspend all commuter rail service on a nearby line. About 30,000 rush-hour passengers were expected to be directly affected this morning by service disruptions on the railroad's busiest branch, the Babylon line, said a railroad spokesman, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> `` There has n't been as severe a tie-up on our system in quite a while,'' said <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. `` It's certainly the worst this year.'' Fire communications supervisor <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said the fire marshal's office and hazardous materials experts were at the scene, and ambulances were standing by in case of an explosion. Propane meets a variety of residential and commercial energy needs, particularly in areas that are not served by natural gas pipelines. The driver, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Vai </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Westbury </LOCATION>, who was treated at the scene for a shoulder cut, was arrested on an outstanding traffic offense and also charged with driving with a suspended license and failure to produce a license. A trainee who was riding with him escaped before the truck ignited, authorities said.

<HEAD>Six Americans Released From Jail In Indonesia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities released from jail six Americans and four other foreigners charged with violating the country's territorial waters, but kept them under city arrest until a court decides their case. The group includes three Australians and a Briton and some members threatened Monday to launch a hunger strike to try to expedite the proceedings. The 10 were arrested March 22 for allegedly entering <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> waters without a proper permit in the eastern <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Riau </LOCATION>, a few miles south of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. A local news report quoted one of the Americans as saying the group was on a scuba diving holiday looking for a sunken wreck when they were arrested. Indonesian newspapers said that in 1986 the crew of a British vessel, the <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pluto </ORGANIZATION>, had recovered $ 15 million worth of china and gold bullion from the wreck of a Dutch ship, the Geldermalsen, that sank in 1752 near where the 10 were found by the authorities. Public Prosecutor <PERSON> Halius </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosen </PERSON> said the foreigners were not charged with illegally hunting for treasure: `` The charge is that they have entered <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> waters and held scientific research without proper permit.'' <PERSON> Hosen </PERSON> said by telephone today that the group was released from jail May 5 in the provincial city of <LOCATION> Tanjung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pinang </LOCATION> `` but they are not allowed to leave.'' He said some of the foreigners denied the charge and some had threatened to go on a hunger strike after a preliminary court hearing Monday during which the trial was adjourned until June 2. The prosecutor said he did not know whether the protesters had begun a hunger strike. He also said he had not decided what punishment to seek for the defendants. <PERSON> Hosen </PERSON> refused to link the foreigners' detention with the Geldermalsen wreck, which was left there by the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> divers in 1985. The six Americans, all from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, were identified as <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Commerford </PERSON>, 38; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanham </PERSON>, 34; and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanham </PERSON>, 34; <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 47; <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>, 43; and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorus </PERSON>, 46.

<HEAD>Workers Face Third Day Cleaning Out Garbage-Infeseted Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Masked workers spent two days cleaning out the rat-infested home of a 71-year-old woman who authorities said allowed more than 20 tons of garbage to pile up for 20 years. But more work remained. `` The odor was so offensive, I could n't breathe,'' <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION> fire Inspector <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrigan </PERSON> said Tuesday after cleanup crews dug their way through the filth, sometimes ducking to avoid hitting their heads as they walked on garbage piled three feet deep. `` There's everything imaginable in there _ clothes, rotting food, rats, bugs, you name it. It's unbelievable,'' said <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Fee </PERSON>. He estimated the cleanup, which began Monday, would be completed today. Masked excavation workers used shovels and a tractor to scoop up the garbage and haul it away. <PERSON> Homeowner </PERSON> <PERSON> Erleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burman </PERSON>, 71, was unhappy with the cleanup, however, protesting that she had been accumulating the contents of the home for years. The single-story home sits in a neighborhood of $ 100,000 houses. `` It's my whole life,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> concedes she has n't cleaned her house in years. `` I've been sick for 20 years. I'm trying to find another husband. I need somebody to help me, you know, paint the house and help pay for the food.'' The retired hairdresser said she sleeps, but does n't eat, in her home. `` I struggle off somewhere to get something to eat and then come back here for a rest,'' she said, adding she frequently visits her daughter's home. As workers sorted through the rubble Tuesday, she pointed at piles of filth and said, `` This is n't all mine.'' She shook her head vaguely and said, `` My husband ...'' Then, her voice trailed off. Twenty tons of garbage and seven refrigerators were removed from the home's back yard by a private contractor hired for $ 4,000. Ms. <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> must pay the costs. `` I carried out stacks of wood completely rotten with termites,'' said contractor Curnelius King. `` I flipped over a refrigerator and a rat jumped straight in the air.'' Fire Department officials originally became aware of the filth five or six years ago while investigating a fire call that turned out to be a false alarm, Fire Capt. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Staudenmayer </PERSON> said. They were unable to do anything at that time, he said. `` If it's not producing rats, we ca n't do anything,'' he explained, adding the case was then turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The Fire Department was called back March 19 because Ms. <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> had n't been seen for some time and neighbors were describing `` hundreds of rats on the roof,'' Staudenmayer said.

 <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s less-than-suspenseful Republican presidential primary added another win to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s column. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cruised to an easy victory in the Democratic `` beauty contest.'' With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had 82 percent of the vote to 9 percent for <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who suspended his campaign earlier this month to rejoin the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was winning 15 of the 18 national convention delegates at stake in the lackluster primary Tuesday, with two going to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and one in the uncommitted column. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was pulling in 73 percent of the vote to 16 percent for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, with only a handful of precincts still unreported. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had 4 percent and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 3 percent; both have suspended their presidential campaigns. The Democratic vote was not binding. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner, claimed a majority of the delegates at caucuses two months ago. With no statewide elected offices at stake this year and the presidential candidates all but formally crowned, there was little to draw <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> voters to the polls beyond a handful of heated legislative and local races. `` For various reasons, the presidential election and others, neither we nor the county clerks are seeing very much intensity in this one,'' Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ysursa </PERSON> said. In congressional primaries, state Rep. <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> rolled up a large victory over two challengers to take the Democratic nomination to face four-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Congressman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> in the 1st District. Former state Sen. <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination to challenge two-term Democratic Congressman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> this fall in the state's 2nd District. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a 19-hour campaign swing through <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> earlier this month to bolster his support in a state that has not given its four electoral votes to a Democrat since <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in 1964. Democrats allotted 18 of their 24 nominating delegates in Super Tuesday caucuses held on March 8. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> captured eight of them, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> four and six were uncommitted. Since then, however, Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>, one of the six previously uncommitted `` super delegates,'' has endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and urged others to do the same so the party is clearly unified for the November assault on the White House. Although there has been no statewide polling conducted, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> poll this spring in the conservative 2nd Congressional District of southern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> only 2 percentage points behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` But it's a long time to the finish line,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Risch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s state chairman. `` The people will have a choice between a person who knows the issues and a governor of a state that really has n't done very well.''

 A retiree described by neighbors as a recluse is accused in federal court documents of having been second-in-command of a system of Nazi slave-labor camps during World War II. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> filed a civil complaint Tuesday claiming that <PERSON> Juris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauls </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, believed to be 75 years old, was the deputy chief and inspector of guards in 1941 and 1942 for 14 concentration camps at <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>. `` The concentration camp was a place of persecution for its prisoners,'' says the complaint, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` Such persecution included ... the incarceration of civilians solely because of their race, religion, political beliefs or national origin.'' According to the complaint, the camps' prisoners were used primarily for slave labor, but some were beaten, starved and executed. `` It was a terrible facility but not as well-known as <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The office requested that <PERSON> Kauls </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, be deported because he allegedly concealed his involvement with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in order to become a naturalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. <PERSON> Kauls </PERSON> entered <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in February 1951, entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1954, applied for permanent-resident status in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen April 13, 1960, according to the complaint. A woman who answered the door at the Kauls' residence and identified herself as <PERSON> Kauls </PERSON>' wife was asked about the allegations. `` That's not possible.

 A weekend fisherman who enlisted the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> to fight the federal government's `` Zero Tolerance'' policy says he is outraged over the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s seizure of his boat for `` absolutely nothing. <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs has two days to return the boat of <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gros </PERSON>, 28, before the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> chapter plans to go to federal court seeking an injunction against the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and Customs for return of the boat. She said she filed a petition Tuesday with Customs for the 23-foot boat's return. The day before, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials announced they were slightly refining the use of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policy under which boats, cars and other vehicles have been confiscated if even a trace of illegal drugs is found in them. The modifications prohibit the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> from seizing boats outside the 12-mile territorial limit if there is no evidence of intent to smuggle. Apart from those changes, however, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Tuesday there is `` no softening whatsoever'' of the policy. Ms. <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is lining up challenges because she is `` afraid we may be approaching a police state.'' `` We feel that Mr. <PERSON> Gros </PERSON> represents many, many recreational boat users who enjoy their boats, who ... are not drug dealers, but merely Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Q </PERSON>. Taxpayer,'' she said. `` The reason for ` Zero Tolerance' does not justify suspension of the Constitution.'' Gros, a Plantation resident, said Tuesday he is outraged over the May 15 confiscation of his new $ 40,000 boat by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. He uses it for his recreational fishing excursions to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. `` They went through everything _ I mean my entire boat,'' said Gros, a service station owner who insists he neither uses illegal drugs nor condones their use. `` We had absolutely nothing on board. They never showed me what they found,'' <PERSON> Gros </PERSON> said. `` They say they scraped up six grains, approximately a gram, and it tested positive for THC -LRB- the active ingredient in marijuana -RRB-. It's simply not true.'' <PERSON> Gros </PERSON> said his boat was searched by two armed <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION>, confiscated 7 miles off the <LOCATION> Bahamanian </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Bimini </LOCATION>, which is beyond the 12-mile limit, and impounded at the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> about 45 miles away. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Robalo </PERSON> at first stopped for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, then `` took off running'' and was chased for about five minutes before being boarded. `` The boarding team found about half a gram of substance on the deck in the open behind the seat, tested that and it came up positive,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` Based on one, the vessel fleeing boarding by a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessel and two, finding a quantity of controlled substance,'' a further search was authorized, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. Small quantities of what tested as marijuana were subsequently found on the boat's console and in a mop, he said.

 A group of up to six <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> diplomats will leave for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, possibly by next week, as the first Israelis to take up consular duties there in 21 years, officials and news reports said today. The Soviets agreed to issue visas to the Israelis at a secret meeting in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> on Monday, said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> political adviser <PERSON> Nimrod </PERSON> <PERSON> Novick </PERSON>, who negotiated for the visas. <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> told Israeli army radio the diplomats' main job in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will be to administer an embassy building for which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been paying monthly rent even though it has been empty for 21 years. Agreement for the visas came 10 months after Soviet consular officials began operating from the Finnish Embassy in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> said he hoped the consular visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could lead to renewal of full diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but described the current agreement as less than a breakthrough. `` What we are talking about is dipping ourselves in the water to check if it is hot or cold. It remains to be seen when our delegates reach <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, how well they will be received,'' <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> said. He added that the agreement followed two months of secret contacts with <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrasov </PERSON>, the deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> department. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during the 1967 Middle East War, when the Jewish state captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> allies. Kremlin leaders have improved ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the last two years largely as part of an effort to become involved in peacemaking efforts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The Soviets held numerous meetings with Israelis abroad and then sent an eight-member consular team to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in July 1987. The Israeli diplomats will number as many as six and work from the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in processing visas for Soviet Jewish emigrants, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> news reports and officials said. There was no date set for when the visas would be issued. But one Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Israeli diplomats could be on their way to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as early as next week. The Yediot Ahronot daily said the visas may come this week or in advance of the superpower summmit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> indicated that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had sought a broader role for its diplomats, which would include handling visas for Soviet Jewish emigrants. `` It looked like it was broadening things to the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> said, adding that now `` there is no argument between us and the Soviets that our group will have a mandate as outlined, to check out the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> building'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He added that the Soviets had agreed there would be `` no restrictions'' placed on other contacts between the Israelis and Jews in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s schools are in an `` advanced stage of decay,'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s education commissioner charged in announcing the state will attempt to seize control of the 32,000-student district. It would be the first time a state has taken over such a big urban district, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s second-largest, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Education Commissioner <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON>, citing rampant political patronage, mismanaged schools and chronic failure to educate the district's students, began efforts to take over the district on Tuesday. The school system in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, an ethnic melting pot of more than 200,000 people, many of them recent immigrants, has come under fire for poor test scores and a high dropout rate. The city is across the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. An independent auditor's report cited by the state also charged that jobs in the school system are treated as political paybacks, and courses are so outdated that one on <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> failed to list 17 countries formed since 1958. `` As is true of other enterprises that reach such an advanced stage of decay, the <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> school district offers a compelling case for bolder, more decisive and non-traditional intervention by higher public authorities,'' <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> said at a news conference. The commissioner said district administrators are incapable of properly running the schools or fixing widespread problems. `` Political patronage, union pressure and cronyism is a consistent motivation, at all levels, in the hiring, firing and promoting of staff,'' he said. Under <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> legislation enacted five months ago, <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> could abolish the local board of education, fire the superintendent and top administrators and appoint a state superintendent to operate the schools for at least five years. The law gives <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> officials some of the broadest powers in the nation to take control of deficient school districts. The district has 10 days to accept <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON>'s decision or respond with reasons why it should n't be taken over. <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON> said the panel would not comment on <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON>'s recommendation until reviewing the report. Meanwhile, the state Division of <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> is to determine whether local officials have committed any crimes. Auditors found inadequate record keeping, missing contract documents and questionable payroll, personnel and procurement practices. The district has wasted more than $ 1.2 million on an improper health insurance plan, the report said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, who ran a separate investigation for the state, said employees routinely were rewarded or demoted based upon which mayoral candidate they backed in the Democratic stronghold. In addition, curriculum guides in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> are so outdated that a course guide for a high school class on <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> fails to list 17 countries formed between 1958 and 1980, and lists four countries that no longer exist. Teachers were n't optimistic Tuesday that state control would end the district's problems. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, a grammar school teacher, said over time, rules have been forgotten and replaced with double standards. `` We ca n't come back, but I guess we've got to try,'' <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> said Schools Superintendent <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has said if the district were properly funded, the state would not need to take it over. He also said that conditions are not as bad as the state maintains and that many problems stem from the city's high crime rate, and drug problems and poverty among district students, many of whom are homeless or do not speak English. <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> countered that the district has enough money, but it has n't been properly spent. `` It's bleak,'' he said. `` I've read everything and respect the superintendent. The facts are stubborn things.''

<HEAD>More Than 60 Injured, 43 Arrested In Soccer Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than a thousand soccer fans stoned police and players and looted a hotel and police station after police detained one unruly fan, an official report said today. More than 60 police were reported injured. Police arrested 43 people during the violence that began Monday and continued through Tuesday morning in the southwestern town of <LOCATION> Nanchong </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province, the Sports News said. It said 13 of the police were seriously injured, but did not say how many fans were hurt. The incident appeared symptomatic of growing violence in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> society in the past few years. One the one hand, official control over people's lives have relaxed somewhat, but frustrations have risen because incomes have not soared as quickly as expected. Sports News said the riot began at 6:45 p.m. when several fans jumped into the field to protest the referee's calls at the end of a 1-1 match between the <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province and <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> city youth teams. Police detained one worker for questioning, the report said, prompting more than 1,000 other fans to block the stadium gate and demand his release, the report said. The rioters threw bricks, stones and bottles at the police and retiring players, smashed windows and set a police car on fire. After police escorted the players to a local police office and a hotel, the mob broke hotel windows and stole stores of cigarettes and beer. Several dozen other people broke into the police office, damaged several rooms and stole cattle prods, handcuffs, cameras and fire-fighting equipment, the newspaper said. Police beat and arrested 43 people at the station, it said. The violence `` basically subsided'' by morning, it said, and the local and prefectural governments convened emergency meetings to discuss the riot. It was not the first time sports passions translated into violence in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In 1985, angry fans threw rocks and bottles, attacked police and spat at foreigners in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s soccer team defeated <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 2-1 in World Cup qualifying play. Five youths were charged with hooliganism. The same year, fans in <LOCATION> Shijiazhuang </LOCATION>, 150 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, stoned a referee and smashed seven vehicles when the referee disallowed a goal for the local team in national championship play. One soccer player stabbed another with a kitchen knife and their coaches exchanged punches at a match in western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gansu </LOCATION> province in 1986. Reports of street violence, including gang fights, and rural violence over such problems as allocation of scarce fertilizer also have risen in recent years.

<HEAD>Woman Accused of Abandoning Children Ordered To Remain On Birth
Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has ordered a young woman to remain on birth control for the rest of her child-bearing years for abandoning her two young sons in a sweltering apartment last summer. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s attorney and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> objected to the sentence Tuesday as a violation of the 18-year-old <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> woman's constitutional rights. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> sentenced Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> to lifetime probation and ordered her to give regular written proof to her probation officer that she is on birth control. `` Your case represents the epitome of what's wrong with our society: A child having children,'' the judge said. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> pleaded guilty in April to two counts of attempted felony child abuse. Her estranged husband found the two boys _ ages 18 months and 6 months _ in the apartment where police say they had been left alone for two days. The children were suffering from malnutrition, dehydration and lesions caused by a rash and were hospitalized in serious condition for eight days. Police said Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> told them she left the children because she was unable to cope with the pressure of caring for them. She said she had used drugs to escape from the pressures and had attempted suicide, police reported. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, called the sentence a `` stunning violation of a person's right,'' and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Billar </PERSON>, a deputy public defender, said it violated her right to privacy. But the judge said Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s `` lack of nurturing'' and the `` close call the children had with death'' merited such an order. The judge also barred Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> from seeing her sons or the daughter she bore in prison two months ago. She also was told that she can not babysit for others. Court records show that Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s daughter has been adopted and that her sons also have been put up for adoption. `` I know I did something wrong, and I have to pay for it. I'm sorry,'' a tearful Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> she told the judge

<TEXT>
 Thousands of people caught a long-awaited glimpse of two giant pandas that went on display at the <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> over the objections of a conservation group that wants the endangered animals returned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The exhibit, which began Tuesday after nine months of planning, marks the first time the Chinese have permitted two pandas to be exhibited together at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> zoo. The animals are on loan to the zoo until Aug. 21. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> made their debut before an invitation-only crowd of about 250. Later, the zoo opened its gates to hundreds who had waited in line since dawn. About 5,000 people visited the zoo on Tuesday, zoo spokeswoman <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. The zoo has between 2,000 and 3,000 visitors on an average weekday. Up to 1 million are expected to see the pandas by the time the display ends. `` They're so cute,'' said <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Grove </PERSON>, 18, of <PERSON> Port </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>. `` I waited on line for three hours, but it was definitely worth it.'' The international World Wildlife Fund contends the exhibit could endanger the pandas and had gone to court to prevent the animals from going on display. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the wildlife fund asked a federal court Tuesday to shut down the exhibit, charging it represents commercial use of the pandas in violation of the Endangered Species Act and an international wildlife convention. The group asked for an expedited hearing, which is expected to be set after the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> files its response within five days. `` It is the first short-term panda exhibit in which both animals are of prime breeding age and were taken from a captive breeding and research facility,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, spokesman for the wildlife fund. `` It is no exaggeration to say that among zoo professionals and conservationists, these might be considered to be among two of the most valuable animals on the planet.'' The zoo has spent nearly $ 3 million in preparing to exhibit the pandas, including $ 1.9 million for their quarters. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergsmark </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said the exhibit is aimed primarily at children. `` They are, perhaps, the last generation that will be able to enjoy seeing the giant pandas if the immense conservation efforts being employed by the Chinese do not receive unified support from the conservation world,'' he said. <PERSON> Viki </PERSON> <PERSON> Billis </PERSON> and her 21-month-old son, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, were among the first in line. `` This is very exciting for <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. We needed this. Every mother and father should take time out and bring their children to the zoo,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Billis </PERSON> said.

 A Soviet army spokesman today said that 13,310 Soviet troops have been killed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and 35,478 wounded since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> entered the Afghan war in December 1979. In the first official statement on casualties from the war, Gen. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON>, head of the army and <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> political departments, also told a news conference that 311 Soviets had `` disappeared.'' They are believed to have been captured by rebels or to have deserted. The figures, through May 1, were higher than Western sources had estimated. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report in late 1987 estimated there had been 33,000 to 38,000 casualties, about a third of which were deaths. <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON>'s casualty figures were in line with a May 19 statement from <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, commentator for the official Novosti press agency, that news reports estimating fatalities between 12,000 and 15,000 were `` more or less correct.'' <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON> said 9,500 of the Soviet officers and troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have left their bases since the pullout began May 15. He refused to give a figure for the Soviet force in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> before the pullout began, but Western estimates say they numbered about 115,000. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON> held fast to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> position that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s civil war was justified `` Soviet troops had been invited to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by the government,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said. `` That is a fact. This can not be reassessed.'' Asked whether the retreat signaled an end to the <ORGANIZATION> Brezhnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> policy developed under late leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> of military intervention to protect socialist revolutions, <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said past practices do not apply to the new Kremlin. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said the Soviet armed forces are committed to protecting allies but did not make clear whether that protection extended to ideological threats. <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON> said Soviet policy has not changed, that it was only recently that there were conditions that allowed the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to leave Afghan government troops to fight on their own against the Moslem guerrillas. Soviet officials and the state-run media have cast the pullout as a successful conclusion to an intervention that has inflicted heavy damage on international relations as well as on the Soviet public. The Afghan government, meanwhile, charged for the fourth time in recent days that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is violating the peace accord that led to the start of the Soviet withdrawal, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted the Afghan government as saying <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> continues to supply weapons to the U.S.-backed guerrilas in violation of the accord. In another development, Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> probably wo n't meet its goal of withdrawing a quarter of its soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> this month because the guerrillas are overwhelming Afghan troops left behind. Agreements were signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on April 14 outlining conditions for a pullout of the Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Among the stipulations was a requirement that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> stop supplying arms to the anti-communist insurgents fighting the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> lodged its complaint against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observers monitoring the Soviet pullout. The complaint, as reported by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, gave no specific details of the alleged violations. Under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords, half the Soviet troops must be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Aug. 15 with the pullout completed by next Feb. 15. Soviet Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> has said 25 percent of Soviet force will be out by the end of May. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, diplomats said the guerrillas have harassed departing <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> convoys and overrun a string of bases defended only by Afghan soldiers. Most of the bases are on the eastern border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

Asked if he could complete his agenda despite <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal problems, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said, `` I'm certainly going to do the best that I can.'' Before <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> was picked, aides to the attorney general approached a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and three current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys in an attempt to find a nominee. All four men rejected the overtures. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, if confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would be the only ranking black official at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced Tuesday his intention to nominate <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, and to nominate <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, attorney, to become deputy attorney general. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said that the two will fill the jobs on an acting basis until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation process is complete.

He said `` if there's a morale problem'' in the criminal division, he plans to `` try to do my part'' to overcome it. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said Tuesday he had no reason to suspect the attorney general's ethics and added that in his dealings with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` he's always been above board. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said he intends to serve in the position through the remainder of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> is a senior partner in a 60-lawyer law firm and was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> in 1975-76.

 Two white policemen implicated by fellow officers were convicted today of murdering a black youth after beating him so severely they did not dare let him go free. The trial, which began last October, is one of the few in South African history in which white policemen have testified against colleagues facing the death penalty for alleged brutality against blacks. The convicted men, Warrant Officer <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON>, 37, and Constable <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON>, 27, are expected to be sentenced later this week after arguments about extenuating circumstances. They were allowed to remain free on $ 250 bail. Justice N.W. <PERSON> Zietsman </PERSON>, who presided over the non-jury trial, said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> had led his unit into a black township on a `` beating expedition'' and assaulted residents indiscriminately. He praised police investigators who pressed ahead with the case after other members of the unit initially tried to cover up the incident. The verdict was to have been delivered Monday, but de Villiers collapsed in court and was taken to a hospital. He was present for today's proceedings at the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Grahamstown </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON> had been charged with two counts of murder in connection with killings on July 26, 1986, in the black section of <LOCATION> Cradock </LOCATION>, a community near <LOCATION> Grahamstown </LOCATION>. They were acquitted on one count but convicted of the murder of 18-year-old <PERSON> Mlungisi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON>. According to testimony, members of <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Villiers </ORGANIZATION>' all-white riot squad drank heavily, conducted a blood-oath ceremony swearing themselves to secrecy, and then made an unauthorized foray into the township in the middle of the night during which several blacks were assaulted. Following another bout of drinking at their base, the squad returned to the township after daybreak. <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON>, who was wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan `` Forward To <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>,'' was chased and grabbed by officers when he tried to walk away from them and was assaulted, several officers testified. The officers said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> ordered that <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON> should be `` taken out'' because of the severity of his injuries. They said <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON> took the youth to a riverbank and shot him in the back of the neck. The defendants contended that the shooting was an accident. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> said he did not report the incident because he was still under the influence of alcohol.

 Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> says Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> lack discipline and battle preparedness, the ministry daily <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> addressed a special meeting of senior army officers from the East German detachment, estimated by Western sources to number about 380,000 soldiers, as part of the preparations for next month's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference. He pressed for reform of the military units stationed in the allied country and championed Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` perestroika,'' or rebuilding, as the appropriate foundation for building a better fighting force <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, who became head of the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s armed forces a year ago, appeared to be stumping for the leader's policies among military officials before the party conference, which is expected to be a faceoff between reform advocates and conservatives. He made the address in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but the newspaper did not say when or in what city the gathering took place. The defense minister provided no specific examples of poor performance by the troops serving in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but he delivered a largely critical report on their military preparedness, according to the newspaper. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> blamed the substandard conditions within the military units on `` stagnant tendencies, low attentiveness and oversimplification.'' `` The Communist Party of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people demand of us that we liquidate these negative tendencies in the army which are harming military readiness,'' <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> told the officers. It was not clear how many were present for his scolding, but the newspaper said the meeting was attended by several other generals and staff members of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, Marshal <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogarkov </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Many of the party organizations of the <ORGANIZATION> GSSG </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Group of Soviet Soldiers in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- have yet to show themselves to be generators of perestroika,'' <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The newspaper said he brought up `` problems of improving the quality of military preparedness and gave constructive recommendations'' for change. Red Star did not report <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>'s suggestions <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> told the meeting that part of the problem was adherence to the `` administrative-command'' form of management, a phrase that has come to refer to the leadership style of late dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. The gap between commanders and leaders and their subordinates must be narrowed and the needs, concerns and interests of the soldiers taken into consideration in all decision-making, the newspaper quoted <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> was named to succeed Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> on May 30, 1987, two days after West German teen-age pilot <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> slipped past the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> forces in the Baltic, flew his single-engine plane undetered over more than 500 miles of Soviet territory and landed in Red Square. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> became a candidate, or non-voting member, of the ruling Politburo a month later. He has called for reform of the military services in the few articles and speeches he has given. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> met with his American counterpart, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> in March.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s new trustee has warned that the TV ministry built by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> will have to go off the air and close its Christian theme park next month if contributions keep dwindling. After Tuesday's hearing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, tearful <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> contributors urged the trustee to allow <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s appearance on cable television to solicit donations they said would save the ministry. M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, the trustee, said he would n't rule out allowing <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s limited return _ `` if it's the best and logical next step for the ministry.'' <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, with current debts of about $ 130 million and assets of $ 160 million, filed for reorganization and protection from creditors in bankruptcy court in June after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s resignation in a sex and hush-money scandal. `` We're considerably short of money now, and we're going to have to have some money soon to operate. Contributions have about dried up,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said at the hearing. In the last three weeks, contributions have dwindled from $ 60,000 a day to $ 22,000 a day, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. It costs $ 27,000 a day just to pay the network affiliates, he said later. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> testified that the ministry may not be able to keep airing the `` <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' TV show, its primary method of seeking contributions. `` The next step is to shut down, and that I'm prepared to do,'' he said <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> was appointed Friday to succeed former <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who said he resigned so he would n't have to preside over the ministry's liquidation. A revised reorganization plan filed last week called for the trustee to liquidate <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets in order to pay creditors. Under the proposal, the 2,300-acre <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> complex in Fort Mill would be sold and a separate, non-profit corporation would lease the property required to operate the church and network television programs. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> is negotiating with non-religious buyers, including a sports executive who wants to build a sports complex on the grounds. After the hearing, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a spokesman for a group of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s big-money contributors, said the donors represents had pledged $ 81 million to the ministry if <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is allowed on the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> network `` to ask for forgiveness. `` Everybody else has tried and failed _ why not <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>?'' said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president for accounting and operational affairs since Feb. 1, said that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> should be able to meet the June 3 payroll, but that he was uncertain whether operating expenses could be met after that date.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it launched a major ground offensive east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> today to retake <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory captured by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> 16 months ago. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it repulsed the attack. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also said its warplanes destroyed a power station in northern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said a separate Iraqi air raid killed 28 civilians in northwestern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The latest hostilities coincided with the opening in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> of a `` Global Popular Conference on Peace'' attended by delegates from dozens of countries. State-run <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> radio broke into regular programming to broadcast a military communique announcing the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ground offensive. It said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces made `` considerable gains'' in the operation code-named `` On God We Depend,'' but it gave no casualty figures. `` Our men attacked the enemy forces to get rid of them and crush their heads, which are empty of human values,'' the communique said. A later communique carried by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Iraqi forces took the southern end of <LOCATION> Fish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, a large body of water created by the Iraqis on the border as an obstacle to Iranian attack. The lake was the scene of fierce fighting when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> took the area in January 1987. Iraqi troops, including elite Presidential Guards, also took the <LOCATION> Jasim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> running through the area, as well as two police posts that had been occupied by the Iranians, the communique said. The attack came after warnings by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that it could launch a major offensive if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> continued to reject a settlement of the nearly 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. It also came the day after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> warned it would retaliate for alleged Iranian shelling of Iraqi border towns. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the ground attack was repulsed. It said fighting was continuing but Iranian forces held their ground, `` vigilantly defending their positions.'' Iranian forces in January 1987 advanced on a 25-mile-wide front to within six miles of the southern town of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and have held much of that territory since. The Iranian agency reported an Iraqi thrust in the northern Iraqi <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> region but said it was crushed with the attackers sustaining `` heavy losses and casualties.'' Iraqi air raids on the northwestern Iranian border town of <LOCATION> Sardasht </LOCATION> killed 28 civilians, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not comment on the claim. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said warplanes flew more than 600 miles to bomb a power station near the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> 125 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, `` turning it into ashes.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the bombs hit workers' houses but reported no casualties <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s news agency said the peace conference in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> was attended by a `` large number of political and social figures'' from various countries. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said Iranian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> told reporters that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s `` aim in holding the so-called peace conference is only to prevent disclosure of facts in regard with identification of the aggressor.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said it will not agree to a cease-fire unless <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> first is branded the aggressor in the war. Elsewhere today, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> for talks on means for achieving a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and for resolving the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> is on a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour that has taken him so far to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>.

 A general strike commemorating a slain Palestinian military leader virtually shut down the occupied territories today, and the army clamped a curfew on at least five refugee camps and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> villages. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded a Palestinian youth during a clash with young men throwing stones and bottles in the Nur Shams refugee camp, officials at <ORGANIZATION> Rafidiyeh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said. A military spokesman confirmed that a youth was shot in the camp today. Hospital officials said the victim, <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulayman </PERSON>, was in critical condition with a gunshot wound in the chest. Tuesday night, soldiers shot and wounded an 18-year-old Palestinian during a similar clash with stone-throwers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, officials at <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. Army officials said they had no information on the report. During today's general strike, an indefinite curfew was placed on the Dheishe refugee camp, largest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, and four locations in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The strike was called to mark the end of mourning 40 days after the assassination in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>. He was military chief of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the largest faction in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, and deputy to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Palestinian, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION>, and other sources say <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos carried out the attack, but the Israeli government has declined comment. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, a cousin of the slain <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader, said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers showed up at his <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> house today to prevent a reception marking the assassination. `` The army is outside our house,'' <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` They turned back anyone who came here.'' In walled, old city of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a firebomb was thrown Tuesday at the car of Trade and Commerce Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, as his wife, <PERSON> Lily </PERSON>, was about to drive from their home, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported. No casualties were reported. The paper quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> as saying she was not even aware the firebomb was thrown. `` Maybe they should try again,'' she was quoted as saying. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported, meanwhile, that the military government in the occupied territories threatened to jail <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> property owners for up to five years if they do not wash anti-Israeli graffiti from their buildings and remove outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags. The military had no immediate comment on the report, which said those who did not comply could also be fined $ 9,670. Israeli authorities are attempting to put down resistance to their occupation of the territories, which they seized in the 1967 Middle East War. Since Dec. 8, at least 195 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed in the unrest. An Israeli today was indicted for manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a Palestinian shepherd on May 5 near the Jewish settlement of <LOCATION> Shiloh </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. It quoted the indictment as saying <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> fired at a group of Arab shepherds just after they shouted to him that they would stop grazing sheep on disputed land near <LOCATION> Shiloh </LOCATION>. One of the shepherds was killed and another wounded. Stores were closed in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, transportation was shut down, and most Palestinian workers did not go to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Witnesses said the general strike was observed throughout the occupied land and Israeli-annexed Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` The Intefadah -LRB- Arab for uprising -RRB- is still going on and will continue until victory and the creation of our independent state,'' said an underground leaflet signed by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> @ Unified Command of the Uprising in the Occupied Territories. The only commerce today seemed to be vendors selling newspapers and doughnut-shaped bread covered with sesame seeds that is an Arab staple. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> primary schools, where classes resumed Monday for the first time in four months, were open despite the strike. Government spokesman <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafovicz </PERSON> said about 90 percent of the 200,000 students attended. The return to school apparently has the support of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> underground leaders who wrote in the latest leaflet, the 17th issued since December: `` We will continue in the civilized path of our people by more learning and education.'' Israeli army officials have said they would open <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> high schools if students did not participate in demonstrations. The government today charged two editors of the left-wing newspaper <PERSON> Derech </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanitzotz </PERSON> with membership in a guerrilla organization and having contacts with a foreign agent, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The two, <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Efrat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Assaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Adiv </PERSON>, face up to 40 years in jail if convicted. Earlier this week, the government indicted two other newspaper employees on the same charges. The four are accused of belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a radical <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction.

 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> warned kidnappers that any harm done to Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would be an `` infringement of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s security,'' the independent <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The prestigious daily cited no source for its 15-word report, which failed to say how and when the warning was conveyed or what the Syrian reaction would be if the warning was not heeded. Also today, the Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> announced that a Belgian doctor helping Palestinians in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> disappeared four days ago after leaving his base at the <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> refugee camp, two miles south of the port of Tyre. A statement released by the committee said Dr. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cools </PERSON>, 32, disappeared at 2 p.m. Saturday. <PERSON> Coots </PERSON>, a general practitioner, has been on a voluntary mission in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since February. No group has claimed kidnapping him. Fears for the 18 confirmed hostages, including nine Americans, have been roused by almost three weeks of fighting between Iranian-backed fundamentalists and pro-Syrian Shiite Moslem militiamen in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums. Most of the kidnapped foreigners in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held in the embattled slums by extremist factions affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s fighters have seized control of 95 percent of the slums in the fighting with Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s Syrian-armed Amal militia Police say 296 people have been killed and 1,000 wounded since the hostilities broke out May 6. They said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> appeared to be marshaling its forces today for a push into the sprawling <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> district to flush out <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> from its last remaining stronghold in the slums. Sporadic shell blasts resounded across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> this morning, but police said no new casualties have been reported from the slums war. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored vehicles massed in hills and dunes surrounding the slums, a warren of 16 square miles of narrow alleyways and cement-block shanties. But a dispute with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over ways of ending the fighting has delayed a Syrian push into the slums. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, apparently alarmed by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s triumph, traveled to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> today. Several <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations said he would officially request <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intervention to halt the slums war. `` <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s expansion heralds the fall of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' warned a front-page headline in the conservative <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper Al-Anwar. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has a predominantly Sunni Moslem population. Sunnis generally reject Iranian patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s brand of Islamic fundamentalism <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has another army contingent of 7,500 troops in charge of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s security. That force was sent on Feb. 22, 1987 at the request of Lebanese Moslem government leaders to curb militia anarchy in the capital's Moslem sector. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni, went immediately upon his arrival in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> into a closed-door conference with Syrian Vice President <PERSON> Abdul-Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON>, that nation's top expert on <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> affairs. Police said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters had mopped up the last pockets of Amal resistance in the southern suburb of <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION> in house-to-house combat. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations said three Syrian soldiers were killed by a stray shell that slammed into their checkpoint on the airport highway on Tuesday. Police and the Syrian command refused to comment on the report. No clear word on the fate of the hostages has emerged since the fight for the Shiite slums began. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the hostage held longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
 Five defendants remain in the second <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> racial attack trial after two young men pleaded guilty to riot charges _ one of them in a secret hearing made public by an appeals court. <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSimone </PERSON>, 20, entered his plea Tuesday before jury selection resumed for the remaining defendants in the case, in which a black man was beaten and another was chased to his death in front of a car by a gang of whites. After <PERSON> DeSimone </PERSON>'s plea, state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demakos </PERSON> unsealed transcripts of a May 19 hearing that revealed <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Buonocore </PERSON>, 19, also pleaded guilty to riot. Under the plea bargains, <PERSON> Buonocore </PERSON> and <PERSON> DeSimone </PERSON> will receive five years' probation and 200 hours of community service. The riot charge is punishable by up to four years in prison. Four of the five remaining defendants face riot charges in the case; the fifth also is charged with attempted murder and assault. In the first trial last year, three young men were convicted of manslaughter. A fourth was acquitted of all charges. Under his plea, <PERSON> Buonocore </PERSON> may testify against the remaining defendants. <PERSON> DeSimone </PERSON>'s plea ensures he will not have to, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Agate </PERSON>. The plea bargains surprised one of the remaining defendants, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Saggese </PERSON>, who reasserted his innocence. `` I'm not guilty of riot,'' <PERSON> Saggese </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> is guilty.

<HEAD>School Board Votes to Discontinue Using Chauffeurs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The School Board has barred its members from taking chauffeur-driven cars at taxpayer expense, averting a threatened cutoff of $ 30 million in state money. <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, who had refused to join fellow board members in giving up chauffeur-driven cars to take them to and from evening meetings, were silent in the voice vote Tuesday night. The decision came two weeks after state Treasurer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said he would withhold the money from the school district, which has a deficit of more than $ 60 million, unless <LOCATION> Rutherford </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> relented. School officials said earlier the district would fail to meet its May 31 payroll without the money. <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said the $ 30 million should be available by Friday. The 11-member board has been criticized for using chauffeurs despite financial problems. The district cut $ 16 million from its budget last year and plans to eliminate 515 jobs in the fall and close 13 school buildings within two years. <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> had maintained that female board members need chauffeurs for protection when traveling to and from evening meetings. She also said she had poor night vision and could n't drive safely. A survey showed the district paid about $ 500,000 in salaries, overtime and bonuses to 12 drivers assigned to the board in 1986 and the first five months of 1987. Board members receive $ 30 for each meeting they attend. They are also reimbursed for expenses.

<HEAD>Beijing Follows Other Cities, Cancels Beauty Contest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s first beauty contest has been called off because such pageantry would be unsuitable when so many people are living in poverty, organizers said today. The cancellation came after other cities across <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> called off scheduled beauty pageants. `` In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, conditions for such an event are not ripe,'' said <PERSON> Long </PERSON> <PERSON> Xinmin </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION>, one of the scheduled sponsors. He cited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s low standard of living. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> scrapped its `` <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Maiden'' contest two weeks ago, also saying that `` conditions are not ripe.'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s decision was not influenced by the other cancellations. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> contest to select 10 `` <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> and Elegance'' entered the semifinals last week. The 10 winners were to have been selected in early June. The event, open to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> women between the ages of 17 and 27, drew 842 applicants. The field was narrowed down to 50 contestants after two stages. Foreign reporters were barred from attending preliminary events and were told they could only cover the finals. They also were barred from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first beauty pageant since the 1949 communist victory, apparently because of fears of negative publicity. That pageant was in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> in 1985. After <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> announced its pageant plans in April, at least half a dozen cities also held local beauty contests. <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province, was the first to finish, selecting its `` Miss Spring City'' in early May. But beauty contest plans in other cities met with disapproval from many people who said such events were improper when many people in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are living in poverty. Newspaper commentators in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> said the city was facing economic and other problems that require `` leaders and the 12 million city residents to be of one heart and one mind and to quietly immerse themselves in hard work. It is premature to spend 450,00 yuan -LRB- $ 126,000 -RRB- on a beauty pageant.'' Miss `` Empress Cup'' of the coastal province of <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> will be awarded 15,000 yuan, or $ 4,054, worth of prizes. That's the equivalent of 10 years' pay for the average Chinese worker. Supporters of the pageants argue that the events would educate people on the correct standards of beauty and help raise awareness of grooming and manners.

The conservative newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> also said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is urging other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> member nations to pick up more of the Western alliance's defense costs Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said the interview was conducted shortly before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> departed for the upcoming summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It said the interview would appear in its Thursday editions but sent it by telex in advance to other news media. `` President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> figures that the START treaty, which foresees the halving of nuclear intercontinental missiles, still can be brought to completion before the end of his term,'' the Bonn-based newspaper said. Die Welt did not provide a direct quote from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regarding his hopes for such a treaty. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told Die Welt and four other European newspapers that the Soviets also are interested in reaching an intercontinental missile treaty with him, rather than waiting for his successor. `` Therefore, the president does n't exclude the possibility of a fifth summit conference with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> this year on neutral ground,'' the newspaper said, again without providing a direct quote. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit starting Sunday with be the fourth meeting between the two leaders. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in November 1985; <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, in October 1986; and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December 1987. In his interview, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also urged other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members to pick up more of the expenses for maintaining military defense forces of the alliance. `` I do n't think this is an area that should cause bad blood between us,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying. `` But it would be helpful if the allies would carry more of the load, especially since the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for years has declined to approve further increases for defense.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s quotes were provided in German and translated by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said it was good that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of Glasnost, or more openness, is being practiced in other communist nations, the newspaper reported. Referring to his relationship with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was quoted by <PERSON> Die </PERSON> <PERSON> Welt </PERSON> as saying: `` We can discuss delicate issues without lingering personal bad feelings.

 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> today denied that it sold <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> heavy water, which can be used in the production of nuclear weapons. The Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had asked <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> whether it re-exported 12 -LCB- tons of Norwegian heavy water in violation of its sales contract, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s official Agerpress news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> and Hungarian radio and television, in a `` false report,'' had accused <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> of selling the water to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> newspapers <ORGANIZATION> Verdens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arbeiderbladet </ORGANIZATION> also said last week that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> may have resold the material to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The Romanian news agency is empowered to deny this piece of information and to state that never did <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> sell heavy water to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Agerpress </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lasse </PERSON> <PERSON> Seim </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s charge d'affaires was summoned to the ministry Tuesday and asked to convey <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s query about the reported resale to the Romanian government A precondition of the Norwegian sale in 1986 was that the heavy water be used only for a planned Romanian nuclear power project, which has not yet begun. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> sold 21 tons of heavy water directly to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1959 and is now demanding the right to inspect <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> nuclear facilities to ensure that the material is being used for peaceful purposes. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses all foreign inspections. For the second time in four weeks, <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> newspapers have raised questions about the possible diversion of Norwegian heavy water without <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s knowledge. A government investigation confirmed an April 21 report in <LOCATION> Verdens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gang </LOCATION> that 15 tons of heavy water was sent to an unknown destination in 1983 by a West German firm. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> requested a criminal investigation by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> prosecutor replied on May 5 that the international transport of the heavy water was not illegal under West German laws regulating the nuclear industry because heavy water is not radioactive material. Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, is used to cool nuclear power reactors by slowing the speed of neutrons released in a chain reaction. It enables reactors to run on natural uranium instead of enriched uranium fuel, and it may be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. <ORGANIZATION> Norsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydro </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s only producer of heavy water, has denied breaking export rules.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today issued a series of denials about its activities on the world arms market, including reports that it helped <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> launch a missile and that it agreed to share technology for missile production with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> denied reports that Chinese leaders agreed to supply <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> with technology for producing anti-ship and medium-range missiles capable of hitting the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. In 1982, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> lost a war to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over the islands, which it calls the Malvinas. A report in The Sunday Times in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> signed a secret agreement during President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last week.

He also denied reports that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> helped <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> test fire a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. `` The allegation about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s assistance in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s launching of a medium-range missile is utterly groundless,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said of a report that appeared in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday It said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> launched a missile April 25 that was produced with the help of Chinese experts and that is capable of reaching the Indian cities of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also called `` groundless'' news reports that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> helped develop Chinese ground-to-ground missiles sold to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left today for his fourth meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, extolling advancements in superpower relations but pledging `` to go still farther'' in the interests of freedom and peace. `` We have many differences _ deep differences, moral differences,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a White House departure ceremony minutes before he left for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, which begins Sunday and ends four days later. `` But we are still fellow human beings. We can still work together to keep the peace. And in working with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can still remain true to its mission -LRB- of -RRB- expanding liberty throughout the world,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Several hundred people were escorted onto the South Lawn of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to witness <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s departure remarks. Under a steady rain, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke as an aide held a black umbrella over him. First lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stood next to the president, sheltered from the rain by an umbrella held by a second aide. But the umbrella failed to keep the president dry. His wife was overheard remarking to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` Honey, you're just soaked.'' He answered, `` I know it.'' She then asked, `` Why did n't you put on a raincoat?'' His answer was not overheard. A military band had played patriotic marches as the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> emerged from the Diplomatic Entrance. Among those in the large crowd standing by were several members of the Cabinet and Soviet ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubynin </PERSON>. As the brief ceremony ended, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> precison flight team staged a low-altitude fly-by. Before leaving for a stopover in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, the president asked for the prayers of Americans `` as I embark on this great task.'' `` Since my first meeting with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, ... we have come a long way,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` My task in the next week will be to go still farther, farther in the interests of peace. Farther toward a universal respect for fundamental human rights. Farther toward world freedom. Farther toward a safer world for all people,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was leaving without a ratified U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles, the highlight of his last summit in December with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The pact is still awaiting <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval and White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is staying behind in the hope the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> may act and the treaty can be rushed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before he meets with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Several of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s own conservative colleagues have stalled action on the pact, arguing it is one-sided and does not address concerns about potential Soviet cheating. But <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders moved Tuesday to halt debate. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday that `` in all likelihood, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be able to act on the treaty by Friday The president, summing up his four-part agenda for the May 29-June 2 talks with the Soviet general secretary, noted in his departure remarks that he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have `` plenty of work'' to do. `` I do not expect it to be easy,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. _ On arms control, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded the pact banning medium-range missiles for reducing the level of superpower arsenals for the first time Progress has been made on a second pact to slash strategic weapons by half, he said, adding that he intended `` to resolve the issues that still stand in the way.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> held out the hope Tuesday that the strategic arms treaty can be completed before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office in January. _ On human rights, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded Soviet advancements such as the loosening of emigration restraints and the release of political prisoners, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he intended to `` see that the positive trends ... continue and the reforms are made permanent. _ On regional issues, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted that the two countries have signed the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords outlining the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and that the first withdrawals have begun But he said he would be looking for Soviet actions to help advance negotiations on problems in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and `` to support <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war.'' _ On bilateral ties, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pledged to extend the areas of cooperation `` This will include everything from practical matters of nuclear safety to radio navigation and the protection of the global environment,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his goal throughout his meetings with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, which began in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985, has been to establish `` a better working relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, one no longer subject to the dangerous highs and lows of the past, a working relationship based on realities, not merely on a seeming relaxation of tensions. ...'' `` In my talks with General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> next week, we will be looking to the future, for there remains much to be done,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are expected to sign some minor agreements on cultural programs, fishing, civilian nuclear reactor safety, transportation technologies and a packet of understandings on Coast Guard-maritime issues, according to Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>. The visit marks the first time the 77-year-old <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sets foot in the nation he once derided as `` the Evil Empire.'' It also is the first time in 14 years an American commander-in-chief has visited <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The last trip was made by then-President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in June 1974. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in the pre-dawn hours of Thursday. He will remain there until Sunday morning, when he boards <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One for the 1 -LCB- - hour trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Almost immediately after his arrival, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are scheduled to begin their fourth summit in 30 months. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Tuesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will make new proposals at the summit to help solve the problem of keeping track of mobile missiles, one of the key obstacles to a new U.S.-Soviet treaty on strategic weapons. The secretary said the administration would also pursue a system for sending observers to suspect sites with little advance warning. In a speech broadcast in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he does not expect to achieve `` a quick, radical transformation of the Soviet system.'' `` There still remain profound political and moral differences between the Soviet system and our own.'' The president said he hopes to reach an agreement on strategic nuclear weapons `` this year _ though it is the requirements of a good treaty and not some arbitrary deadline that will determine the timetable.'' The president's remarks were broadcast overseas on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Worldnet'' satellite service. The speech was taped Monday in the Oval Office.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration discussed a plan in 1985 to send agents to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to abduct the reputed ringleader of the group holding American hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but rejected the proposal out of fear it would anger the French government, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said today. American intelligence had received word that <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> linked to terrorist attacks, was visiting <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and some members of the administration advocated seizing <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON> and bringing him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trial, said the official. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, fearing an abduction would cause a major blowup in U.S.-French relations, shot down the proposal, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Instead, French officials were asked to arrest <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>, but they did not act on the request, said the official. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, which first reported the proposal, said in a report broadcast today that the plan was conceived by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, then director of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NPR </ORGANIZATION> reported that it was never completely proven that <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> at the time his abduction was proposed. In early 1986, following new reports of <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>'s presence in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, local authorities did act on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request and went to a hotel to arrest him. Instead of finding a Lebanese terrorist, police found a family of vacationers, <ORGANIZATION> NPR </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON> has been identified by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> terrorism experts as the leader of <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, an Iranian-backed group held responsible for the kidnapping of nine Americans and other westerners in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on charges of participating in the June 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner and the killing of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, one of the passengers. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke of the proposal to abduct <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON> said `` there's always a lot of brainstorming about this sort of thing. It was an idea that was floated. People were saying ` how can we do this'?'' `` It did n't get to the top level,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> felt strongly that if something like this was to be done it could not be through secret connivance; there had to be a decision by <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> political authorities to arrest him and turn him over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 For almost four months, an elderly widow was kept `` doped up'' and barred from contact with the outside world by a couple authorities say bilked her out of more than $ 100,000 in savings. One day, however, <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> managed to slip a note to relatives 500 miles away in <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and a sheriff's deputy eventually rescued her from the <LOCATION> Ringgold </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, house that was her prison. Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> went back to the <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> trailer where she was kidnapped and waited for word that her tormenters had been caught. Now, almost two years later, a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> couple has been charged with federal fraud, kidnapping and conspiracy. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, 31, were indicted May 10 by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said Tuesday. They surrendered Friday in <LOCATION> Tickfaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and are being held on $ 100,000 bond. `` They destroyed everything I had,'' the 83-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said Tuesday in a telephone interview from her <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> home. `` They kept me doped up most all the time I was there. I could n't stand up; I could n't walk; I could n't do anything.'' The widow's ordeal began Feb. 3, 1986, when a couple she barely knew came to her trailer park home in <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>. She says she woke up three days later in <LOCATION> Ringgold </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said she had met Mrs. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> only once, on a visit the previous Christmas to <PERSON> Ringgold </PERSON>, where Mrs. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> had cared for Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON>, for several years. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, then captain of detectives for the <ORGANIZATION> Catoosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>'s neighbors remembered seeing her carried from her mobile home, but friends or relatives who would call to check on her were told she was sick, or at the doctor's. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> authorities apparently were reluctant to pursue the case, believing it was a domestic dispute rather than a kidnapping, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said that one day she finally managed to get her brother to mail a letter to her niece, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittie </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. `` He took it out to the end of the driveway, waited for the mailman, bought a stamp from him and got him to mail it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. The letter brought her niece to <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who said he went to the house on June 5, found Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> and `` told her that her relatives were here and asked her if she was OK.'' Eventually, he said, he took her to his patrol car because she was obviously in ill health and frightened He later notified the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said he returned to the house a week later and the Barretts had left. He believes they traveled to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and back to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. The indictment claims the <ORGANIZATION> Barretts </ORGANIZATION> stole $ 101,875.72 in all, depositing the money in a <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, bank in the name of <ORGANIZATION> Barrett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bakery </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s Cajun Bakery and Deli. It alleges they forged Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>'s signature on Social Security and retirement checks from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and gained access to her savings accounts, using the money for their own purposes. The Barretts administered Valium, Quaaludes, Percodan and laxatives to keep Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> under control, according to the indictment. `` I did n't know they had taken everything I had'' until <PERSON> Black </PERSON> rescued her, Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. She has been living in <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION> ever since, and said she has suffered no lingering effects from the drugs. At the time of the rescue, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said, he asked <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> if he wanted to leave, but he refused. <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> has since died and is not mentioned in the indictment. Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>'s niece said that <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> had given Mrs. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> his power of attorney and may also have been under the influence of the couple, the Constitution reported today. If convicted, the Barretts could be sentenced to life in prison and fined $ 2 million. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said they will be arraigned in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, in a few days.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today accused a `` liberal elite'' of seeking to undermine <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense and said that while he was encouraged by the upcoming superpower summit, `` we can not wish away the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a competitor.'' The Republican presidential contender, addressing a graduation ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, said the times require leadership that `` will pursue negotiations with the Soviet realistically.'' Standing in a pouring rain during the outdoor ceremony, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the graduating cadets that summits such as the one in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> beginning this weekend `` are good in and of themselves, for they contribute to an atmosphere of peace and familiarity.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> must not become too complacent about a Soviet threat just because the two sides are talking. In what was billed by his aides as a non-political speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lashed out at liberals. However, he praised the late President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> for standing firm against the Soviets in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, saying that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s acts were in line with a bipartisan consensus on dealing with the Soviets that had prevailed from the 1940s `` But by the'70s the consensus had fractured, splintered, the center did not hold,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The liberal elite do not understand, they never understood, the common sense behind'' the former approach to the Soviets, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the graduating cadets. `` They are so blinded by ideology that they can not see what Americans have understood for 40 years: that peace flows from strength,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that such people, whom he did not identify, `` will make the world more dangerous.'' The vice president addressed the graduating class of 849 men and 90 women. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was campaigning later today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, then was heading to his oceanfront vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to spend the next week meeting with advisers and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders with an eye to sharpening his strategy for the fall campaign. Republican advisers in recent days, mindful of recent polls showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trailing Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, have urged the candidate to come up with more specifics on campaign issues that will help to separate him from the administration's recent problems His aides are portraying the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> visit as low-profile and say they expect the vice president to do more listening than newsmaking while the public spotlight is on the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. During the time in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will `` be meeting with -LRB- Republican -RRB- governors, senators, congressmen, people with expertise in economic and domestic affairs,'' said campaign spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>. `` Basically, he'll be discussing issues, and looking at these issues in relation to the general election.'' Despite his continued efforts to identify himself with accomplishments of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in recent weeks has staked out his own stands apart from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s on issues ranging from education to day care and the environment. He has also put some distance between himself and the administration's efforts to strike a deal with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, including the possibility of dropping drug charges in exchange for his relinquishing of power. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that, if elected, he would not negotiate with drug traffickers. And aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> privately has urged that talks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> be broken off. On Tuesday, House Republicans met for 90 minutes with top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials. Participants said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was applauded at the meeting for differing with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` It's a very symbolic circumstance, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has moved from being vice president to being his own candidate,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` Almost to a person they were pleased about the separation on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s poor showing in recent polls, showing he was behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a hypothetical fall matchup by margins ranging from 7 to 16 percentage points, was also discussed at the session, according to participants. `` We have bad polls. If this were October we'd be suicidal. But it's May,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. But, she added, `` There was n't anybody up screaming, ` My God, we've got the Titanic.' The seas are rough.'' The Republican lawmakers met with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager; <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, the vice president's chief of staff, and pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> shrugged off the recent polls and said he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members `` we're in a very artificial period, that period when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been rolling along. What you got to do is get past this <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary before people begin to focus on it -LRB- the presidential race -RRB-.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> both hold primaries on June 7. After speaking in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to speak to a group of senior citizens in <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and attend a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rally in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. On Thursday, he planned several campaign stops in the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> area before heading to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>.

 A flight mechanic without a pilot's license stole a private jet in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> early today and took it on a 1,600-mile joyride to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where he shot himself as authorities closed in, officials said. `` The indication was that he just wanted to fly around for a while,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Stapleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> police, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and emergency vehicles were waiting at the edge of a runway at the airport when the twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Learjet </ORGANIZATION> 36 came to a stop in a landing an airport spokesman said appeared to be that of a proficient pilot. `` As the crash crew and law enforcement personnel approached, he was ordered to lock his brakes,'' said <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>. `` They heard a noise and when they looked in the cockpit they found him dead. Things happened really fast.'' The man, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>, 24, of <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was alone in the jet stolen from his employer, <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, at <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION>, where the plane sideswiped a security van as it took off, said airport spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Daikos </PERSON>. `` We're not sure whether he had a gun when he started, but when he landed he was surrounded and he shot himself, shot and killed himself,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Daikos </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> had been a flight mechanic at Flight International since March. He said <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> did not have a pilot's license. `` This is bizarre,'' <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON> said. `` Rarely do you find someone stealing a plane like this worth millions of dollars.'' `` This guy obviously was a proficient pilot,'' he said. `` He made a good landing right in the middle of the runway with no damage to the plane or the runway.'' <PERSON> Daikos </PERSON> said the man is believed to be a former resident of the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area. No one saw him armed, he said. Atlanta-based Flight International performs ground services for corporate aircraft and airlines and operates the world's largest fleet of Learjets, <PERSON> Daikos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daikos </PERSON> said Flight International also `` is a major contractor with the armed forces to test defense mechanisms by challenging them.'' He said some of the Learjets have classified electronic gear, but the stolen plane was not believed to be so equipped. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed that the man was an employee but refused further comment. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> Commission security staff, which oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> airport, reported receiving a call about 2:15 a.m. from a guard who told him an aircraft was being stolen, <PERSON> Daikos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> drove onto the runway in a van and got out, <PERSON> Daikos </PERSON> said. The airplane apparently hit the van, damaging the driver's side and leaving what appeared to be part of a wingtip fuel tank on the runway, <PERSON> Daikos </PERSON> said. No one was injured. Air traffic controllers at several airports had tracked the plane for parts of the flight across the country, <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> said. Controllers in <LOCATION> Longmont </LOCATION> picked up the plane over <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>. The jet landed at 5:18 a.m. `` We got an experienced Lear 36 pilot up in the <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> control tower and he managed to talk him down into a good landing,'' <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON> said. According to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s All The World's Aircraft, the Learjet has a flight range of about 1,640 miles when carrying four passengers and a full load of fuel. Flight experts here said the Learjet 36 is designed to seat two crew members and 11 passengers, although <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON> said this plane could seat six or seven passengers. <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON> said the plane was picked up at 39,000 feet. He said the Learjet cruises at about 500 mph.

She had not taken fertility drugs, which often are associated with multiple births, he said. `` A few years back, these babies would have had a poor chance of survival, but now with the neonatology advances, these babies have an excellent chance,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said she and her husband have one other child, a 4-year-old girl. Asked if she planned to have any more children, she answered with an emphatic, `` No.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today accused a `` liberal elite'' of chipping away at a national consensus that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must deal from strength in approaching the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reaped endorsements on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> before flying west for a debate with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the all-but-certain Republican nominee, used the graduation ceremony at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> to say that the 1980s require leadership that `` will pursue negotiations with the Soviet realistically.'' Speaking as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was leaving for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said such superpower meetings `` are good in and of themselves, for they contribute to an atmosphere of peace and familiarity.'' However, he added, `` We can not wish away the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a competitor.'' Without naming names, he said, `` The liberal elite do not understand, they never understood, the common sense behind'' what he said was a former consensus on dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` They are so blinded by ideology that they can not see what Americans have understood for 40 years: that peace flows from strength,'' he told the graduating cadets. One day earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked up what could prove to be an unwelcome piece of baggage on the campaign trail _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a big trade bill. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has frequently criticized the expected veto, said today at the Capitol that it was `` a tragedy'' for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to take such action because of a provision requiring companies to give 60 days notice to workers before closing a plant. On a happier note for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican nominee-to-be cruised to an easy victory in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s presidential primary on Tuesday. He was picking up 15 of the 18 national convention delegates, as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won a non-binding Democratic `` beauty contest'' with no delegates at stake. With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was taking 73 percent to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 16 percent in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was gaining 82 percent to 9 percent for <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who suspended his presidential bid earlier this month. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was winning one delegate, with two going to the uncommitted column. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has more delegates than he needs for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up endorsements from more than a dozen members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and met privately with former rival <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr.. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' talk with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> resulted in no endorsement, but `` it was a good, friendly meeting,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said of the session He said the two men met alone in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hotel room. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to spend a week at his summer home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. After speaking to the graduating cadets at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, he was expected to keep a low profile to avoid upstaging <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. Tonight's Jackson-Dukakis debate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> comes as the two campaign for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s June 7 primary. Candidates' debates were almost painfully commonplace earlier in the campaign, as the the-crowded Democratic field met frequently for talkfests. But the last time <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met for a debate was in April, prior to the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. Back then, the two were exchanging mainly pleasantries. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been more critical of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in recent weeks as the delegate gap between the two widened. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is now within striking distance of the 2,081 delegates needed to nominate. He has 1,680 to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 983, according to the latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the trade measure, which would require advance notice of plant closings. `` Any administration that is willing to give Gen. -LRB- <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> 120 days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to give the American worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out on the street,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said, referring to talks aimed at easing the Panamanian military leader from power. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment on drug charges. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made it clear the plant-closing issue would be used as ammunition in his expected campaign against the vice president. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he said, `` do n't understand that for working families ... there is nothing more painful than losing a job.'' Even some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backers broke with the administration on the trade bill. Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign chairman, was one of 60 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans who joined in the 308-113 vote to override the veto. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders have said they expect the veto to stand in their chamber. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not come out directly in favor of the president's position, but he has n't publicly dissented either He has edged slightly away from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by speaking favorably of the plant-closing law in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home state. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that he approves of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> measure because it is voluntary, whereas the federal one would be mandatory. For the vice president, the trade bill was the latest example of an administration action that has left him on the defensive as he campaigns. In one such controversy _ the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> affair _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> let it be known, if in cautious terms, that he disagreed with the president. On Tuesday, at an anti-apartheid rally in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> renewed his call for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to be designated a terrorist state, and said he would push to include that in the party platform. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also released a five-year budget plan this week calling for a freeze in military spending. He underscored that idea on Tuesday in a speech before a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> luncheon in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and said that he hoped it would also be reflected in the platform. `` After the largest military buildup in our history, we must change our course or lose our way,'' he told the group.

 Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen today attacked three southern strongholds of pro-Iranian guerrillas after Israeli jets, helicopters and artillery fired on the villages. A police spokesman said about 750 militiamen from the Israeli-allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> advanced toward the villages of <LOCATION> Soujud </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lowaizeh </LOCATION> and Mleekh behind fierce shelling and air cover. The three villages, a few miles north of this market town just outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone, are traditional strongholds of the Shiite Moslem extremist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. Most of the villages' civilian populations had left after <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> started using them as bases for attacks against the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli helicopter gunships and jet fighters carried out at least nine attacks against the three villages and surrounding hills before the tank-led <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces began a two-pronged attack around dawn, the police spokesman said. The spokesman, who by regulation can not be identified, said <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces stormed through <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> lines in the villages of <LOCATION> Lowaizeh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mleekh </LOCATION> and were advancing toward Soujud. <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fighters in Soviet-designed T-54 tanks `` overran <LOCATION> Lowaizeh </LOCATION> and are currently fighting <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s pockets of resistance in <LOCATION> Mleekh </LOCATION>,'' he added. Another <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> force, advancing behind a barrage of Israeli howitzer fire, was engaged with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters at the southern entrance to <LOCATION> Soujud </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. Soujud is five miles north of <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lowaizeh </LOCATION> is another five miles northeast of <LOCATION> Soujud </LOCATION>. Mleekh is midway between the two villages. The three villages are just one mile west of an <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Army-held mountainous road connecting the town of <LOCATION> Marjayoun </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security zone with the Christian town of <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION>. Security sources in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> attack came hours after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> massed a mechanized force of about 600 troops in mountainous areas overlooking the battleground. One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Israeli forces `` crossed into the security zone late Tuesday and drove to the hill of <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> and the village of <LOCATION> Aishiyeh </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Marjayoun </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Aishiyeh </LOCATION> are along the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Army-controlled stretch of terrain connecting the security zone with <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> today, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s armed forces chief of staff said there was a danger of escalating clashes between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militia in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` There is no doubt that when we attack <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> there is a danger, some threat of escalation, but we attack only those who threaten us directly, and in this case, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> does provide a direct threat,'' said Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas had used bases just north of the security zone to launch attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border and its forces in the zone. However, Israeli forces had limited their role to supporting the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in today's fighting, he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has maintained the 6-to-10-mile-deep security zone since the summer of 1985, after withdrawing the bulk of its occupation army from southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Army-policed border strip serves as a buffer against guerrilla attacks into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said its fighters were `` confronting'' the attack on the three villages, and the police spokesman said the attacking <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> force was `` facing stiff resistance from <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters in valleys around <LOCATION> Mleekh </LOCATION> and Soujud.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> had earlier ordered its fighters to `` spread'' in the valleys in an apparent effort to avoid suffering heavy casualties. Tank-led Israeli troops stormed through <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> lines in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>'s village of <LOCATION> Maydoun </LOCATION> on May 4. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said 40 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters and three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were killed in the confrontation. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has launched nine previous air attacks into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year that killed 49 people and wounded 75, by police count.

 Former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was hospitalized in intensive care because of chest pains, officials said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 70, was listed in guarded condition Tuesday night at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and was undergoing tests, said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON>, the hospital's assistant administrator. He began suffering chest pains during the day. After an hour-long interview with <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> newspaper group, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> continued to feel the pains. The family consulted with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' personal physician and it was decided he should be taken to the hosital for a checkup, said <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' chief spokesman. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was taken to the hospital by car at about 8 p.m. Tuesday, said <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON>. There were unconfirmed reports Monday that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' health was deteriorating, but his spokesman, <LOCATION> Gemmo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, said at the time <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was healthy, although still grieving the death of his mother. `` He's admitted that he's feeling ill _ that he is not well,'' <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON> said at the hospital. Also at the hospital was <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, who was wearing her customary black dress and sunglasses. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> left the hospital through a side door and appeared to be escorted by four people. She told them, `` Thank you so much for coming.'' Asked if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was going to be all right, she replied, `` Yes, I think so. I hope so.'' In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, a former defense minister under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, and Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>, who ran on Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s ticket but has since grown critical of her administration, said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> should be allowed to return home. `` This is going to create another problem if -LRB- <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> -RRB- comes home in a box,'' <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON> said today. `` Now is the time for the government to act and allow him to return.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was hospitalized briefly at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> last October during which a parathyroid gland was removed to ease chronic pain in his legs, doctors said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his wife and their three children have lived here since fleeing the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> during the February 1986 civilian-military revolution toppled him after 20 years in power. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was first elected president in 1965, ruled the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> with a mixture of dictatorship and democracy, reform and stagnation. He was re-elected in 1969. In 1972, he declared martial law as troops arrested scores of opponents, saying it was needed to save the country from communism and to reform society. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ruled with an iron hand for the next eight years. He lifted martial law in January 1981 but gave up little of his vast powers. A few weeks later, he won another term against a little known candidate in an election that was boycotted by all his major opponents. The beginning of the end for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' reign came in 1983, when his most powerful challenger, <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, was assassinated on his return from exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Opposition to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> grew rapidly, and he scheduled an early election in February 1986 to prove his popularity. The Commission on Elections said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> won, but opponent <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s widow, charged the election was rigged and also claimed victory. Later that month, Defense Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> broke with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Soldiers, joined by hundreds of thousands of civilians, rose up against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, sweeping Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the presidency. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 95-year-old mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, died in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> on May 4. The family appealed to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return for funeral but she refused, citing national security. The body has been lying in state at a suburban <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> church, where scores of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters have been conducting a vigil marked by calls for his return.

 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Borders refused to testify today at <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeachment proceedings against federal Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, and deprived investigators of eagerly sought testimony by a crucial figure in an alleged bribery scheme. Borders, flanked by two lawyers, cited Fifth Amendment guarantees against self-incrimination in refusing to answer any questions by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on criminal justice, which is studying impeachment charges against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. Borders noted only that he was convicted in 1982 of arranging a $ 150,000 bribe for <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from two <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> racketeers, was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $ 35,000. He served 33 months in the <LOCATION> Allenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, federal prison and 27 months on parole, and was subsequently disbarred by the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. `` I believe that my legal debt to society expired on May 22, 1988, after my release from parole,'' Borders said. `` I respectfully refuse to answer any and all questions based on my ... rights under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION>.'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., the subcommittee chairman, said his panel would decidelater the `` very difficult'' question of whether to grant Borders immunity from prosecution and compel his testimony <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring with Borders, who is a close friend, to solicit a bribe from the two convicted racketeers, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, in exchange for a promise of lenient sentences and return of a major portion of seized assets. Borders refused to testify at both his own and <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' trials. He also refused to testify before a five-judge investigative panel of the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that was appointed shortly after <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted. The judicial panel concluded there was `` clear and convincing evidence'' that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> actually took part in a bribery scheme and then attempted a cover-up by lying under oath and manufacturing evidence at his trial. The panel's findings were endorsed unanimously by the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the chief policy-making body of the federal judiciary, and forwarded to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders in March 1987 with the advice that `` consideration of impeachment may be warranted.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who continues to sit on the bench for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, insists he knew nothing of the bribery scheme and accuses Borders of using his name to shake down the <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> brothers. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeachment panel heard testimony on Tuesday from linguistics expert <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuy </PERSON>, who said a critical telephone conversation between <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and Borders on Oct. 5, 1981, was spoken in code, possibly in an attempt to disguise details of a bribery plot. The phone call from <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to Borders in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was secretly recorded by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. One of its undercover agents, posing as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, already had delivered a $ 25,000 bribery down payment to Borders. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> says the 29-second conversation concerned some letters he had drafted to help another friend, <LOCATION> Hemphill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pride </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, regain his lawyer's credentials after serving a prison term for misappropriation of housing funds. <PERSON> Shuy </PERSON>, chairman of the linguistics department at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the recording `` indicates that Borders and <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> were using a code to convey information that was not obvious to outsiders,'' both in their words and the `` structure of the dialogue.'' <PERSON> Shuy </PERSON> refused to speculate what <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and Borders were really discussing. But under questioning by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staff lawyers, he said it was possible they were talking about bribe payments and concern over whether <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> should order the return of forfeited assets seized from the <PERSON> Romanos </PERSON>.

 The estate of Hallmark Cards' founder owes the government more than $ 200 million in taxes, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says. If the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> prevails in the case being heard this week in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the $ 131.5 million estate left by <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> could become bankrupt. Hall died in 1982 and had earmarked his fortune for <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> charities. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> contends that <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s main asset, stock in Hallmark, was sold by the estate at far below its market value. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> says an accurate valuation is needed to establish the correct estate taxes so the government gets its proper share. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s estate contends that the stock really has no market value because the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> greeting card maker is privately owned; instead, the stock was sold for a price determined by an often-used formula based on the adjusted book value of the stock. `` The estate is confident of its legal position,'' Hallmark spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hucker </PERSON> said.

 The chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opponent of the superpower medium-range nuclear missile treaty said today `` I'm licked'' in efforts to amend the agreement, apparently clearing the way for approval before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> begins his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting. `` I'm licked in terms of doing anything on the treaty,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, as he sat down at a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders to work out a procedural tangle that has stalled action on the treaty for more than a week. The move raised hopes among treaty supporters that the pact could be approved for ratification as soon as Friday, and forwarded to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by the time the summit begins on Sunday to give him a stronger position in the talks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and his Republican counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, had filed petitions Tuesday to limit debate and force it to a vote in time for the `` I'm fairly confident we will be able to finish the treaty Friday or Saturday,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. But he noted that potential problems still exist, including competing items on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s legislative agenda, such as attempting to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a trade bill <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today for the summit, with a three-day stopover in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, en route. The president was looking ahead to the next arms-control treaty, one he hopes will call for massive reductions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arsenals of intercontinental nuclear missiles. He said he hoped such a pact could be reached before his term expires in January. `` It is the requirements of a good treaty, and not some arbitrary deadline, that will determine the timetable,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in remarks broadcast on the government's `` Worldnet'' satellite service. The treaty, which requires elimination within three years of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles, requires 67 votes for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval. Estimates of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> support for the measure range from 87 to 95 votes, so its ultimate outcome is not in question. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, as it is known, would result in the elimination of 867 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and elimination of 1,752 Soviet missiles. But <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and a few other conservatives have sought to delay the measure, raising questions about the validity of intelligence data on the numbers of some Soviet missiles and the crafting of the treaty language. They have offered a series of amendments since the treaty was brought up last week, all of which have been defeated by overwhelming margins. `` Both sides fouled up on this treaty,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said during Tuesday's debate. `` My conscience will not allow me not to pursue the obvious defects.'' But <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> filed motions Tuesday to limit the debate, and a vote on that matter was scheduled for sometime Thursday. It was considered virtually certain to win the 60 votes needed to cut off debate, and that would set up a vote on final approval of the treaty for sometime Friday. Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, D-Ark., a treaty supporter, said he believed opponents were not attacking the intermediate-range missile treaty but were instead trying to sow doubt about a future treaty cutting long-range missile arsenals `` It seems to me like nuclear idolatry,'' <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said. `` The ideologues will never, never go gently into that night.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he was confident Democrats would still be able to bring up and debate the one amendment adopted during committee consideration of the treaty, one that would force the president to get <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval for any later change in interpretation of the treaty. The amendment is an attempt to assert the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional right of advise and consent on the president's treaty-making power, and stems from a dispute over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration reinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with the <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said today he had prepared a possible compromise on the amendment, which was put forward by Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., but declined to discuss it

 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pocketed endorsements today from more than a dozen members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and met privately with vanquished rival <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as he methodically made the rounds of the Capitol. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also renewed his criticism of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of trade legislation. He said it was `` a tragedy'' to veto the measure over a provision requiring companies to give 60 days notice to workers before closing a plant. In addition, during a meeting with Western lawmakers, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized the administration's environmental policies, saying offshore oil drilling `` should be a last resort, not a first.'' Though Republican Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is considered strong in the West, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the lawmakers he would run an aggressive campaign in their states. He said the issues that are important to voters nationwide are the same ones that concern Western voters including jobs, education, economic opportunity, a clean and safe <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and a `` strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' private talk with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> resulted in no endorsement, and aides said in advance none was expected. `` It was a good, friendly meeting,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said of the session. He said the two men met in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hotel room without aides. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also was receiving the formal endorsement of several members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the views of several dozen others in a fast-paced series of meetings. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent his morning in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before a scheduled flight to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and an evening debate with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in advance of the state's June 7 primary. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the Democratic nominee in all but name, and his morning schedule was designed to depict him as the leader of a <ORGANIZATION> united </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>. He moved from meeting to meeting with lawmakers who will share the Democratic ticket with him in the fall. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign said those endorsing the governor included: Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Among House members, Reps. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilenson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Esteban </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign made sure that the governor's meetings with those lawmakers, as well as groups of southern and western congressmen, were well covered by reporters. In contrast, the session with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was held in unusual privacy. The meeting did not appear on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' printed schedule, and the senator walked alone into the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was staying and was ushered into his room. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator has more than 350 delegates to the Democratic National Convention in his column, and has urged his supporters to stay loyal. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has slowly been whittling away at <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s delegate strength. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has 1,680 delegates, out of 2,081 needed to win the nomination. Aides say they have no doubt that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will emerge from the final day of the primary season with a nominating majority in hand. These campaign officials say they expect <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will earn roughly 300 of the 456 delegates at stake June 7 in the year's final <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primaries in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> That would mean they need to find another 100 to 150 from the ranks of the uncommitted or from candidate dropouts like <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> to reach the total needed to clinch the nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after an evening fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor set out on his campaign swing after spending most of Tuesday in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where he issued a statement that managed to link President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the trade bill with the administration's protracted negotiations with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, indicted on drug charges. `` Any administration that is willing to give General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> 120 days' notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to give the American worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out on the street,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed the trade bill, citing objections over a provision requiring employers to give workers advance warning on plant closings. In his statement, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tied his probable Republican opponent in the fall, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to the veto, saying that neither the president nor the vice president understands `` that for working families who struggle to pay the mortgage, save for their children's education and care for their elders, there is nothing more painful than losing a job.'' `` I think the president is making a very serious mistake,'' the governor told reporters. `` This is a good trade bill. It's a responsible bill. ... To veto this bill because it will give working people and their families 60 days notice beore they're laid off, seems to be to be unconscionable,'' he said.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> said today in a statement released by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> that his manager and attorney are negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> to get his `` Late Night'' show back on the air, possibly as early as June 8. The Writers Guild has been on strike against television and motion picture producers since March 7. Negotiations broke off soon after the strike started, but resumed this week with a federal negotiator, and a session is scheduled for today. No details of the negotiations have been released. Only `` The <ORGANIZATION> Smothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hour </ORGANIZATION>'' and one independent movie producer have received waivers from the Guild to continue production during the strike. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, whose `` Tonight Show,'' like `` Late Night,'' has been in reruns since the strike began, went back on the air last week, writing his own material. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> is not a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> is. <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION>, said if the union membership agreed in its meeting on Thursday, the <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> show could receive a waiver. `` We assume he is referring in his statement to the independent contracts, which, if the members agree at the meetings on Thursday, will be available to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> as well. We do not wish to comment further on the substance of our conversations between our lawyers and the <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> people,'' she said. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s statement, typically tongue-in-cheek, said: `` During the last two weeks, my manager <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, my attorney <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Elberger </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> have been working with the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to resume production of ` Late Night.' The signs seem most encouraging that we could return to the air, accompanied by our entire writing staff, as early as June 8, 1988. `` In the meantime, I am keeping busy with my gardening and phoning my favorite talk-radio programs. Last month, I splurged and treated myself to much-needed liposuction surgery on my hips and thighs. I look and feel 10 years younger. `` Finally, I would like to thank our audience, the best-looking television audience in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, for their loyalty and patience.''

 U.S.-backed rebels have accepted <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> as the site for a new round of peace talks with the government, a rebel spokesman said today. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, secretary of the Nicaraguan Resistance directorate, said by telephone from <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> that the rebel delegation, headed by <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, would go to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> later today. The government of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had insisted that the talks, scheduled to begin today, be held here. The rebels, known as Contras, had refused to return to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, complaining of strict government limits on their activities during two previous sessions. They wanted instead to meet with leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, a post on the Costa Rican border where the two sides signed a preliminary peace plan on March 23. The aim of the talks is to work out details of a permanent cease-fire in the war that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> says has killed 26,500 people and caused $ 3 billion in damage to the economy. <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said the Contras would go to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> `` with the understanding that there will be complete and unrestricted freedom of expression and the free right to meet with organizations and leaders.'' The government had reiterated Tuesday that it would allow the rebels to meet with the most important opposition group in the country, the Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, visit the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops conference and the opposition daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, as well as relatives. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said today that the government `` has everything ready'' to receive them. American and Honduran officials, meanwhile, said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> appears to be building up arms stockpiles to attack the rebels if the peace talks fail, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Honduran officials cited aerial reconnaissance photographs of Nicaraguan territory and other evidence they say suggest a Sandinista military buildup. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the photos showed that airfields at <LOCATION> Wapsam </LOCATION> near the Honduran border and at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tranquera </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> have been upgraded. They say pictures also show new military storage depots are being built near <LOCATION> Sebaco </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, and that military supplies are being stockpiled at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tempisque </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a congressional aide said the rebels planned to offer to lay down their arms on Sept. 1 as part of a comprehensive peace accord to be presented to the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION>. Contra leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said the proposal will include `` all the necessary things for a permanent end to the war in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had argued that holding the talks in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> `` would be to put the conversations at the brink of breaking off'' and would mark `` a setback in political terms.'' `` It would be to accept that all that has been achieved since the first contacts -LRB- late last year -RRB- can be lost,'' he added. In the initial <PERSON> Sapoa </PERSON> plan, the negotiators agreed on a 60-day cease-fire to give time to arrange a more lasting peace. The temporary truce was scheduled to run out on May 30, but <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Monday announced he was unilaterally extending it for an additional 30 days. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, members of the rebels' political directorate said they would not break the truce after it expires May 30, even if no new truce agreement is in effect. But they said they were not officially accepting <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s extension. The Contra leaders also said they would accept a proposal for delivery of humanitarian aid to their forces inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by an agency with ties to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will have good monsoon rains this year to help make up for last year's widespread drought, a government official predicted on Wednesday. <PERSON> Vasant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gowariker </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected the first rain to hit the western state of <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION> by the weekend, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. He said that a study by his department and the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of weather patterns indicated that most factors this year `` favor a good monsoon'' rain, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. The study looked at temperatures around the country in May, wind patterns and pre-monsoon rainfall, which has been normal is most parts of the country. More than two-thirds of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people work in agriculture, which is heavily dependent on rain. Last year the rains failed in 16 of the nation's 25 states, sharply reducing rice, wheat and fodder production. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is importing wheat from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and corn from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to make up for the losses. The rains fall from June through September and account for more than two-thirds of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s annual rainfall.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> urgently needs more priests to counter inroads made by religious groups from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Genetic Sampling Can Replace Whale-Hunting for Research,
Scientists Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Whales can be studied without being killed if researchers take skin samples for genetic analysis, two scientists say. `` Management policies and conservation measures may now be determined without the need to kill whales,'' <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoelzel </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> write in a letter in Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature. Whale-hunting for scientific purposes has become a political issue. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> imposed fishing sanctions against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in April for approving the killing of 300 minke whales in the Antarctic for research purposes. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had passed a resolution opposing the hunt. Japanese officials say the commission has no power to ban such whaling. Researchers plan to study the health, growth rates and diet of the whales, Japanese officials said. In their letter, <PERSON> Hoelzel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> said researchers have gained valuable information about whales from commercial and scientific whaling, as well as from stranded animals. But given what has already been discovered, `` our new priority should be to characterize accurately the size of populations and their genetic status,'' they wrote. `` The technology needed to determine these fundamental population parameters without killing animals is at hand.'' Skin samples can be retrieved by firing a specialized arrow, equipped to recover a skin sample and tethered to a fly casting reel, into the animal's skin, they said. Genetic analysis can then determine each animal's distinctive `` DNA fingerprint,'' providing an accurate method for population counts, they said. Other genetic studies can trace reproductive behavior and the status of genes present in whale populations, they said.

<HEAD>Genes Influence Roles of Bees in Hive, Studies Show</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Genes play a major role in whether a honey bee serves its hive as a groomer, guard or even an undertaker, two studies suggest. Certain genes may make particular bees more responsive to environmental cues that trigger those behaviors, the authors wrote. The findings have `` substantial implications for our understanding of the evolution of division of labor in colonies of social insects,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Breed </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> said in an editorial accompanying the papers, which appear in Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature. Bee colonies are collections of subfamilies, each created by the queen bee and a different drone. Researchers used artificial insemination to establish subfamilies that could later be differentiated. Then they looked for relationships between a bee's subfamily, and therefore its genetic inheritance, and its job in the hive. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> studied worker bees that specialized in standing guard at the hive entrance or in removing corpses. Only a minority of bees do those jobs, they wrote. They found significant genetic differences between the groups, and between each specialist group and other worker bees. The other study found evidence for genetic influence on the tendency of worker bees to groom nestmates, wrote <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Frumhoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who did the work at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION>. In the editorial, <PERSON> Breed </PERSON> said scientists should now see if queen bees choose a range of mates that would encourage variety in jobs. Queen bees mate up to 17 times, he said.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Democrats are nervously watching a crop of candidates loyal to political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, and worrying about a predicted dismal turnout in for June 7 primary featuring no statewide contests. Some top Democrats even have endorsed Republicans in a couple of legislative districts. `` I'm confident that where there is a race we're going to win,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON>. In all, 16 <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> backers are running in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Democratic primaries, five seeking congressional nominations and the rest running in legislative districts. <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> said Democrats will work to make sure voters know which candidates back <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and will deny them access to party-sponsored events. `` We'll be helping out the regular Democratic candidates,'' <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> said. In 1986, three <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> backers ran for office, when <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> of Cedar Rapids got nearly 18 percent of the vote in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary. The increase has Democrats scratching their heads, because the state's farm-based economy is improving. `` The ` send them a message' slogan that everybody was using in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> was very relevant, we had big problems,'' <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> said. `` The general resentment toward government just is n't there this time.'' Few of the LaRouche candidates are actively campaigning, though two legislative candidates will get the official party nomination because they are the only Democrats on the ballot. House Speaker <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Avenson </PERSON>, who runs Democratic legislative elections, has endorsed <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbents in those districts. `` I far prefer a mainstream Republican to a LaRouche backer,'' <PERSON> Avenson </PERSON> said. `` We're going to urge voters not to vote for them,'' <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> said. `` That means they either do n't vote in that particular election, or they vote for the Republican. `` While the number may have gone up this time, the level of activity has gone down,'' <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> said. Part of the reason Democrats are nervous is the experience in neighboring <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where two <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> backers won statewide primaries in the last election, tossing that state's party into turmoil and destroying efforts to unseat Republican Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` I think everybody learned a good lesson from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> said. Aggravating the worries is a projected low turnout, which state officials say could be less than 15 per percent of the 1.6 million registered voters. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> political activists were wearied by months of intense presidential campaigning leading up to precinct caucuses Feb. 8, and there are few races of interest to draw voters. It's the first election since 1976 in which neither a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat nor the governor's office is at stake, and all six incumbent congressmen are seeking re-election. Only freshman Democrat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON> in northeast <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s 3rd District has primary opposition, and that comes from <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> backer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Grinnell </LOCATION>. In that district, Republicans <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Redfern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> square off in a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. <PERSON> Redfern </PERSON> wanted to run when the seat was open in 1986, but forgot to sign his nominating petition and missed the filing deadline by 15 minutes. Freshman Republican Rep. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, who for years played <PERSON> Gopher </PERSON> on television's `` Love Boat,'' has no primary opposition in his bid for a second term from western <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s 6th District. There are, however, four Democrats running in a primary. With little activity at the top of the ticket, election officials say they're counting on local elections to spark pockets of voter interest. There are 30 Democratic legislative primaries and 17 for Republicans. In addition, sheriffs in all 99 of the state's counties face election this year, and that office usually gets heavy local attention. As of this month, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> had 495,182 registered Republicans, 562,039 registered Democrats and 504,082 registered voters who expressed no party preference.

 A Naval investigator at a hearing for six sailors charged in the March 2 drowning of a recruit denied a defense request today to close the proceedings to the public. The hearings, which began today, are the military equivalent of a grand jury inquiry. Lawyers for two of the sailors argued that extensive press coverage would prejudice any future panel that may consider the case if court-martials are ordered in the death of airman recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. Cmdr <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> D'Alesio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the investigating officer, said he may close portions of the hearings to consider whether certain evidence can be admitted or might prejudice any future court-martial. `` I think the law is clear: If there is any closure it is to be done with a scalpel, not an ax,'' <PERSON> D'Alesio </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> died during rescue training exercises at a <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> pool. Investigators said he was dragged into the pool against his will, and his head held under water. On May 10, five instructors were charged with involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery, and their commanding officer was charged with dereliction of duty. D'Alesio, of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, will recommend whether the charges should be handled at a presidential preference of the delegates selected or allocated thus far to the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, July 18-21, 1988.

<HEAD>Dems Ask Reagan to Halt Aid to Contras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Democrats called today on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to halt current deliveries of aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels, including plans for cash payments to the troops, and set up a new delivery system through an organization linked to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Meeting in a closed-door caucus, party members approved a resolution stating that the current delivery system _ which includes a carrier with past ties to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> _ violates a two-month-old cease-fire agreement and the legislation that provided $ 17.7 million in humanitarian aid. The resolution called on the administration to `` make immediate arrangements for delivery of aid through the <ORGANIZATION> Pan-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>,'' an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> arm that has been deemed acceptable to both the rebels and the Sandinista government in public statements. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which is administering the aid program, has so far delivered 600 metric tons of food, clothing and other supplies to rebel forces inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> through other private contractors, said AID spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The loads delivered so far have been inspected by representatives of the Catholic church in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to make sure they contain no lethal supplies, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. Most of the deliveries have been made by truck, although there have been about a dozen airdrops, he said. AID also plans to begin this week purchasing cordobas, the Nicaraguan currency, for distribution to rebel troops in the field as early as next week, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> added. Troops will receive about $ 1 a day each, he said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said AID could not begin to make delivery arrangements with the foundation, as the Democrats requested, because it had no formal notification that the organization is acceptable to both sides. `` There has to be a formal agreement in place,'' he said. `` We have said all along that the neutral delivery mechanism has to be part of an agreement between the resistance and the Sandinista government.'' He added: `` It is wholly unrealistic to expect AID to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PADF </ORGANIZATION> in specific terms until there is a signed agreement or some kind of reliable public statement.''

 ... Superpower wrangling over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s prized space-based missile defense is being viewed as the major stumbling block in negotiations to cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range nuclear arsenals by up to 50 percent <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had hoped to sign the treaty at their <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, beginning Sunday. The strategic arms reduction treaty would have slashed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent _ by far the most radical achievement in the roller coaster history of arms control. There are still unresolved problems about verification. How, for example, could <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monitors be sure the Soviets were not illegally hiding missiles, especially those that are hard to track? Mobile missiles are in this elusive category. So are cruise missiles carried by planes and warships. Still, the Strategic Defense Initiative _ popularly called Star Wars _ and Soviet attempts to constrain it, turned out to be the main treaty spoiler. The program, launched by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> five years ago, is a multi-billion-dollar search for ways to use lasers, kinetic energy or other futuristic technology to destroy Soviet ballistic missiles as they hurtle through space toward their targets. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his supporters see the space defense program as a natural complement to nuclear weapons reductions. They want to reduce offensive arms and also improve defenses so the weapons remaining in the Soviet strategic arsenal have less of a chance of getting through. Besides, they are convinced that the Soviets, while protesting Star Wars, are quietly engaged in their own space defense program. At the last superpower summit, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December, the Soviets proposed that the two sides agree to abide by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty `` as signed and ratified.'' The accord limited anti-missile defenses on the theory that a potential aggressor would hesitate to launch an attack if his weak defense exposed his own country to devastating retaliation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> countered, proposing language to allow space-based testing of Star Wars technology `` as required.'' At the windup, the two sides agreed on an ambiguous statement that included `` as signed'' from the Soviet proposal and `` as required'' from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side. It did not settle the dispute over the future of Star wars. During negotiations this year in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the Soviets proposed attaching to the START a protocol to limit space defense tests and demanded the right to stop cutting back their missiles if they concluded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program violated the 1972 ABM treaty. However, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side refused. Instead, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> proposed that the Soviets explicitly accept a broad interpretation of the 1972 treaty _ one that would give the current administration and succeeding ones a lot of running room to experiment in space. The net result was deadlock. Referring to the Star Wars dispute and the verification problems, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said earlier this month, `` It's now clear there is no way these questions can be shaped up in treaty form in time for the summit.'' So when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> meets <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> they will have no treaty to sign. All that will be ready for them to approve is a single provision designed to ease tensions. It is a pledge for each side to notify the other before any missile test launchings.

 Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> breezed through the Capitol on Wednesday, picking up endorsements and advice from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and declaring he will not `` concede one single state to the Republicans'' in the fall campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also met privately with defeated rival <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He got no endorsement there but said he and the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator had a `` very cordial meeting.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor took a fresh shot at President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of trade legislation. He said it was `` a tragedy'' to reject the big trade bill over a provision requiring companies to give their workers 60 days advance notice before shutting down a plant. In a meeting with Western lawmakers, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also criticized the administration's environmental policies, saying offshore oil drilling `` should be a last resort, not a first.'' He made his fast-paced tour of the Capitol before flying off on a Western campaign swing, including a Wednesday night debate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> with Democratic rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> expects to wrap up a nominating majority of Democratic National Convention delegates on June 7, the final day of the primary season when elections are set in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Several Southern lawmakers observed pointedly that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had fended off pressure during the primary campaign from traditional Democratic interest groups, and they said he would be a more popular general election candidate that <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> was in 1984. Sen. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> said that four years ago <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> `` overpromised'' in the early primaries whereas <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not. That was a reference to the perception that <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> catered to a series of special interest groups during his campaign. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been `` able to resist many demands'' that look good but turn out to pose problems later on. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said repeatedly he will contest <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in every state. `` We are not going to concede one single state to the Republicans in the fall,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor held separate sessions with Southern and Western lawmakers, where the talk centered on regional issues. In contrast to the meetings in the Capitol which were orchestrated for maximum news coverage, the session with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> took place as quietly as could be managed. It was not on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' printed schedule, and the two men met privately in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hotel room. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said they had had a `` very good conversation.'' Asked whether <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had agreed to release more than 350 delegates pledged to him, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated, `` It was a very cordial meeting.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> wrote his delegates last week urging them to stay loyal at least for the time being. Even so, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been steadily whittling away at <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s delegates as he has moved towards winning a nominating majority The lawmakers who endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during the day included: Sens. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Survey Says TV Rates Highest for Recreation and Information</HEAD>

 School children say they prefer watching television to any other leisure activity, while reading is the least popular pastime, according to a survey released Wednesday. Grade schoolers also say they trust what they hear on television more than what they read in newspapers, the survey released by Weekly Reader says. In the lower grades they love reading books, but that ardor cools by grades 4 to 6, the survey reported. Weekly Reader said its survey of reading and TV habits was prompted in part because low test scores and high dropout and illiteracy rates indicate children are reading less than they once did. Survey results were compiled from teacher summaries representing about 117,000 of more than 340,000 children who answered questionnaires in class. Weekly Reader said that statistically the survey was not a random sample whose results could be projected, but it said the sample was large enough to be taken as representative. Some findings: _ Watching television was something 80 percent or more of all children in grades two through six said they liked a lot Only 3 percent or less said they did n't like TV. _ Among second-graders, 65 percent said they liked reading a lot and 8 percent said not at all By sixth grade, only 39 percent had a strong yen to read, 10 percent were anti-reading and the rest were lukewarm. _ Newspaper reading was popular with 28 percent of second-graders, but with only 11 percent of fifth - and Those who said they did not like reading newspapers at all ranged from 35 percent of sixth-graders to 43 percent of fourth-graders. _ Asked what they typically do at home, 55 percent said watch TV, 14 percent play, 14 percent talk on the telephone, 11 percent listen to the radio and 6 percent read _ Asked where they get their news, 69 percent said television, 23 percent radio, 5 percent magazines and 3 percent newspapers _ Fifty-seven percent said they believed the TV news a lot, but only 47 percent said they had strong faith in newspapers, 45 percent in radio and 15 percent in magazines

<HEAD>Record Export Sales Offset Import Climb in First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed dramatically during the first three months of the year as an all-time high in American export sales offset a relentless climb in imports, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The trade deficit from January through March totaled $ 35.9 billion, a 12.7 percent drop from a deficit of $ 41.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987. It was only the second quarterly improvement in the deficit in the past two years and it represented the biggest decline since the deficit fell by 18.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1982. Analysts said the sharp narrowing showed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has finally turned the corner on trade and should see in 1988 the first yearly decline in the trade deficit since 1980. `` We believe that 1988 will finally be the year of the turnaround, and these figures support that prediction,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an economic consulting firm in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. She predicted the trade deficit would fall this year by about 10 percent from last year's record $ 160.3 billion deficit, when measured on a balance-of-payments basis. The new figures confirmed an improvement that had already shown up in the department's monthly merchandise trade reports. The earlier figures showed a 16.4 percent drop in the deficit to $ 36 billion in the first quarter, compared with $ 43.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987. Wednesday's figures are smaller because they subtract factors such as shipping costs and military sales from the monthly numbers. The balance-of-payments deficit is also adjusted for seasonal variations; the monthly figures are not. `` We are making slow but steady improvement, but we should n't get too confident,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, chief economist with <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investment firm `` We wo n't see progress in reducing the deficit continue at this rate.'' The improvement in the first quarter came from a 9.8 percent surge in export sales, which rose to a record high of $ 74.7 billion, as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies continued to enjoy an export boom fueled by the weaker dollar. Since the spring of 1985, the dollar has fallen in value by 50 percent against the currencies of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and many European countries, making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products more competitive overseas. Unfortunately, the weaker dollar has driven up the cost of imports as well. In the first quarter they rose to a record high of $ 110.6 billion, 1.3 percent above the fourth-quarter level. Analysts termed the continued rise in imports disappointing, but Ms. <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> noted that much of the growth in imports apparently came not from consumer demand but from a pickup in business spending as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories boosted investment to expand production facilities in order to meet the increased export demand. She said this business investment should slow in coming quarters, and this would help lower imports. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is counting on strong export sales to provide close to half of total economic growth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year as well as blunt the drive by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact trade legislation that the White House considers protectionist. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cited the improving trade figures on Tuesday when he vetoed the omnibus trade bill. The figures are in current dollars before adjusting for price changes caused by the decline in the value of the dollar since 1985. When inflation is factored out, the trade deficit in volume terms fell 12.8 percent in the first quarter to $ 36.7 billion when expressed in 1982 dollars. In current dollars, the trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> fell by $ 1.9 billion to $ 12.9 billion in the first quarter. The trade deficit with Western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> dropped by an even sharper $ 3.8 billion to $ 4.5 billion. The deficit with the newly industrialized countries of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, fell by $ 1.1 billion to $ 6.9 billion.

<HEAD>Allies Think `Star Wars' Program May Fade Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Only a year ago, one of the hottest topics of public debate in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan for a missile defense system in space Today it's rarely mentioned, and when it is talked about, there is little of the urgency or anguish that punctuated the earlier discussion. `` There's a more relaxed attitude now,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Corterier </PERSON>, a West German who is secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, an advisory body of legislators from 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries. The main reason: a growing number of American allies in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> suspect the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public's enthusiasm for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as `` Star Wars,'' has passed its high-water mark `` It's becoming less likely that it ever will come about,'' says Ton Frinking, a centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> and member of the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The Europeans recognize that the issue of space-based defenses is still an important obstacle to a U.S.-Soviet agreement on reductions in long-range nuclear weapons. But as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> headed for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for his fourth meeting with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Europeans appeared less concerned that SDI would be the main problem. The Soviets strongly oppose the plan, saying it would lead to an arms race in space. They have insisted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> renounce the program, although the vehemence of the Soviet argument has subsided recently. `` It seems to be negotiable now,'' said <PERSON> Frinking </PERSON>, adding that a key reason for this was mounting concern in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the cost of the program. `` The Americans are n't going to pay for it,'' Frinking said in a recent interview, noting that the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration will inherit huge budget and trade deficits. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> insists he will not drop the idea of building the defensive shield, which he said could make nuclear weapons `` impotent and obsolete.'' But the program faces severe financial constraints. For the current budget year, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been allotted $ 3.6 billion for SDI research. That's $ 1.7 billion less than it wanted. For the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has recommended holding the research allotment to $ 4.1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the amount is too small and will lead to `` major restructuring and delays in the program.'' Frinking and other Europeans say their doubts about the future of the program are strengthened by recent reports suggesting SDI may wither in the 1990s. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, an independent <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel, said in a report this month that SDI initially should be scaled back to a limited, ground-based defense against missiles. When he first proposed the idea in March 1983, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he wanted a space-based shield that could protect not only <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> but also <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from ballistic missile attack. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vision, which he linked to the possibility of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide, stirred heated debate in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Some said it brought into doubt the basic <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy of deterring attack by maintaining large arsenals of offensive nuclear weapons. Many West European governments were ambivalent, if not hostile, to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal. Among their concerns was that it might provide only a limited defense for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Three years ago, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said SDI raised crucial questions for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy. He suggested that a space-based shield could be `` outflanked by relatively simpler and demonstrably cheaper countermeasures.'' Among the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, only <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> have signed formal agreements to participate in research for the program. There are indications that even these three are not entirely happy with it. In September, the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> adopted a report accusing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of breaking a promise to offer its allies more than a token role in SDI research. It said non-American companies had been awarded less than $ 100 million in contracts through the end of 1986, compared with $ 7.3 billion for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms. Despite this irritation, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies rarely raise the Star Wars issue any more. In a special report this month on the future of the Western alliance, a select committee of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> expounded on nearly every aspect of defense and security, including <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s technological challenges. There was not a single word about SDI.

 A new treaty making deep cuts in each superpower's arsenal of long-range nuclear weapons could be dangerous because the Soviets could either cheat or legally evade limits in the pact, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> study contended Wednesday. The report was issued an hour after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and his summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. One of the topics on the agenda is the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Talks -LRB- START -RRB-. `` No START agreement will come out of the summit next week and that's good,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the committee `` There is a great deal to be done before arms control policy and weapons system decisions are harmonized.'' The proposed START agreement would affect the long-range arsenal of each nation. It is being negotiated now and is designed as a successor to the separate U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range missiles, a pact now before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for ratification. The outlines of the proposed START agreement generally call for each side to cut its long-range arsenal by about 50 percent, to 6,000 weapons, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. But weapons-counting provisions which <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said have already been agreed to on both sides would allow the Soviets to legally add as many as 3,000 warheads _ and the Soviets could add up to 4,300 more if they cheat, the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrat noted. `` All of this does not mean we should abandon arms control generally or START in particular,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` What it does say is that we should look to the structure of our own forces to guarantee deterrence.'' The warnings were issued by the defense policy panel, an <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee which <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> has used to examine arms control issues. The proposed limit of 6,000 weapons `` is an illusion,'' the study said. That is because of the proposed counting rules which treat each bomber as a single weapon _ regardless of how many nuclear weapons, such as bombs or missiles, are carried on each plane. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also would be allowed similar additional weapons,'' it said. `` In fact, because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has more bombers, it would probably end up with more legal weapons.'' `` Thus, the actual ceiling on weapons under START is more like 9,000-10 ,000 on each side, rather than 6,000,'' the panel said The Soviets would also be able to cheat, particularly since the proposed START pact would not ban flight tests of permitted weapons. Weapons could be hidden without fears about their capability because some could be flight-tested, it noted. The issue is similar to one which was raised as part of the medium-range missile pact, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. Among the weapons banned by that pact is the Soviet SS-20 and the Soviets have declared a stockpile of 250 of the weapons which must be destroyed. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies believe that even more SS-20s may be hidden, but their military value will degrade, according to supporters of the treaty, because the pact bans any flight tests. `` START will not ban flight tests, so the military capability of any concealed forces will not decline over time,'' giving the Soviets incentive to cheat, the study said. It said the Soviets could also break out any START treaty quicker than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The reason is that `` given the history of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic arms development, it seems unlikely that the president would propose such a course -LRB- a break-out -RRB- or the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approve it. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planner, however, could not rely upon internal checks and balances in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Thus, `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must plan for a Soviet force not of 6,000 weapons, but of many, many more,'' the study said. Stricter verification is not the answer because no verification is likely to be strict enough, it said. Besides, procedures such as anytime, anywhere inspections might hurt the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because the Soviet inspections would be given the same right to look at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities.

 A judge on Wednesday sentenced an 18-year-old man to spend the rest of his life in prison for beating a classmate to death in a crime prosecutors described as a satanic sacrifice. <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> of <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> to life in prison without possibility of parole, the circuit clerk said. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> had pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for prosecutors' promise not to seek the death penalty. Prosecutors accused <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> and two other teen-agers of beating 19-year-old <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON> with baseball bats and dumping his body in a cistern. Prosecutors say the Dec. 6 beating was fueled by the teen-agers' involvement with drugs, satanism and violent rock music. One defendant was convicted of first-degree murder earlier this month. During that trial, a psychiatrist testified that <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> was the leader of the teen-agers' self-styled satanic cult, and planned <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON>'s death as a sacrifice. The third teen-ager was to stand trial next month.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students were sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $ 500 each today for their part in two parties Feb. 6 that resulted in 46 students seeking medical attention for drinking too much. This is not `` an undergraduate frolic that got out of hand, it is a violation of the law,'' said Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Annich </PERSON>. `` I'm not aware of a similar event that has produced as many casualties,'' he said. Thirty-nine students went to the university infirmary and seven to the hospital after initiation parties held by the <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the Cloister Inn _ two of 13 on-campus eating clubs, which resemble fraternities. Many of the students were underage.

<HEAD>Safety Commission to Ban Most Lawn Darts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday to ban most lawn darts, citing the danger of death or serious injury from the pointed metal toys. The ban could take effect by the end of the year, although several legal steps remain to be completed. Three children, aged 4, 7 and 13, have been killed in accidents involving the darts in recent years, according to commission records. In addition, an estimated 670 lawn-dart injuries are treated annually at hospital emergency rooms. Lawn darts, which have long metal tips, have become popular as a yard game. They are tossed through the air, with the points sticking into the ground in or near a target. The 2-1 vote called for a ban on lawn darts with the long, dangerous metal tips, Some darts on the market, with blunt plastic tips, would not be banned. The matter now goes back to the commission staff to develop a formal rulemaking to enforce the ban and to solicit comment from the public. After that, likely in late summer or fall, the matter returns to the commissioners, who could then vote on a final ban and set an effective date. Currently federal rules ban lawn dart sales in toy stores and toy sections of other retail outlets, but allows them to be sold in sporting goods stores. In March, the giant retailer <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, announced that it was discontinuing lawn dart sales after the commission questioned the way they were displayed in <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stores. The agency is surveying other stores to see how the product is displayed and sold. Voting for the ban on Wednesday were <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> and Commissioner <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. Commissioner <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> was opposed.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian negotiators were close to agreement today on a deal leading to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation as his nation's defense chief and departure in August, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official said The official, who insisted on anonymity, said it was his understanding that an agreement was `` consummated this morning'' but added that the package could not be considered completed until <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> confirms it with a public announcement, which could come later in the day. According to the official, both governments were preparing formal announcements. The key provisions of the deal reportedly include <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation as commander-in-chief of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and subsequent departure from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and the dismissal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug smuggling indictments against him Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, en route to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, told reporters at midday: `` It's still a day-to-day proposition. We could hear something at any time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> said that Panamaniam Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> reported that a deal had been worked out. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> had worked with Panamanian officials until the early morning hours in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, hoping to complete an agreement before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left at mid-morning for <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, and, eventually, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the summit meeting with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that begins Sunday. The administration apparently was intent on reaching an agreement before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s departure because it did not want the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> issue to overshadow his visits to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> indicated on Tuesday the administration was prepared to suspend the talks for the duration of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s absence from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> if no agreement was reached. Today, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who was to accompany <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the trip to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, delayed his departure until later in the day to monitor the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the talks were continuing but he gave no details. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said today, `` I'm for no He said, `` It sounds to me like a deal that will get the president out of town, give prestige to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and dump the problem in the next president's lap.'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who has been allied with administration efforts to ease <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power, said Tuesday that the plan being worked on by the negotiators is certain to be rejected by the democratic opposition in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The anti-Noriega forces `` will reject the deal,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> told a news conference. `` There will be no peace in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The turmoil will continue.'' He said that the deal would enable the `` criminal empire'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has created within the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> to remain in place and that it would not ensure that the scheduled presidential elections in 1989 will be free. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> disputed <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>'s contention that <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> was attempting to negotiate <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political future in violation of diplomatic norms. `` What gets put together there is up to the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who has continued to function as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> despite <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s efforts to fire him, confirmed many of the previously reported details about the arrangement that <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> is negotiating. He said that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would resign as commander of the Defense Forces in August and leave Pamana afterward, returning once an elected civilian government is installed in May 1989. In the interim, he would be allowed to return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for holidays. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictments against him would be withdrawn and the economic sanctions the administration has imposed against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would be lifted once <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leaves. President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, who replaced ousted president <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> in February, would continue to govern the country but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would still consider <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the legitimate authority, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> position is that the indictments are unenforceable and that their dismissal would be a small price to pay for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure. But <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said that the proposed deal would change little in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ amounting to `` Norieguismo without <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> took his criticism of the administration's position on Monday to Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, one of the chief architects of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. The administration view, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said, is that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would lose some power when he steps down as defense chief and lose even more when he goes into exile. As the administration sees it, assurances of a free press would be a further guarantee that democracy will be restored, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> disagreed. `` We should n't sacrifice principle for expediency,'' he said. `` No deal is better than a bad deal.''

<HEAD>Israel Launchs Advertising Campaign to Counter Arab Uprising</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> launched a $ 5 million advertising campaign Wednesday to counter the crippling effects on its tourist industry of the nearly 6-month-old Arab uprising in the occupied territories. Officials had hoped to reap a tourist bonanza on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary, but now they're anticipating a drop of about $ 300 million. That would make tourism, the nation's biggest source of foreign capital, the industry hardest hit by the unrest. `` It's a disaster. The cancellations are coming in a murderous rhythm. I'm losing hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' said <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtern </PERSON>, a hotel owner and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Netanya </LOCATION>, a popular <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> resort. <PERSON> Shtern </PERSON>'s 150-room <LOCATION> Netanya </LOCATION> Hanesicha hotel is operating at 10 percent of capacity, and 63 hotel employees have been fired this month as a result. <PERSON> Shtern </PERSON> says each time his office telex switches on, his hopes rise. `` The telex starts up, we all get excited, and it's another cancellation. We do n't even ask the reason anymore,'' he said. By comparison, 1987 was a record year for Israeli tourism, with 1.52 million visitors bringing in $ 1.6 billion. On Wednesday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> got the first official look at the advertising campaign, slated for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the slogan: `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>: See for Yourself.'' The ads feature television endorsements from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tourists saying how safe <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s popular vacation spots are. `` The idea we're selling is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is n't just the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. It's <LOCATION> Masada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> oranges, all these wonderful things,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, president of New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Grey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION>, one of the companies involved in the campaign. `` When there's a crisis on, we ca n't compete with the front page. But after people read the headlines, these ads say: ` Forget what's going on in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, it's beautiful here in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,''' <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is also treating European and American travel agents to all-expenses paid tours of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to promote the country. To help Israeli hoteliers, the ministry contributes two dollars for every dollar an owner spends to advertise his hotel abroad. But some hotel owners have already complained that the $ 5 million budget for the campaign is not enough to effectively fight <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s tarnished image, brought about not only by the unrest but by the army's handling of it. More than 190 Palestinians have been killed, mostly by Israeli army gunfire, since December. Two Israelis have died. `` Five million dollars when we are going to lose hundreds of millions is nothing. It's a drop in the bucket. If you spend that little, you might as well do nothing at all,'' said <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenbaum </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we have today is as much an image problem as a security problem,'' said <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, marketing manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the country's 320 hotels. `` People are not just worrying about rocks or terrorist acts. The problem is that in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s image has been sullied. It's a political problem, something we've never tackled before,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> believes the lost revenue will amount to $ 500 million instead of the $ 300 million estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Twenty percent fewer Americans came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in April compared with the same month last year, and the biggest decline was among American Jews, according to Tourism Ministry Spokeswoman <PERSON> Dvora </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganani-Elad </PERSON>. Tourism in March and April slid 23 percent compared to the first two months of the year, and advance bookings have plummeted. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> alone, about 60,000 people have called off plans to travel to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Tourism buses standing idle in their lots have prompted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s largest bus company, Egged, to announce it will lay off 500 employees The Hilton Hotel in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> has already fired 180 workers and reduced the remainder of its 650-member staff from a six - to a five-day work week

 Hail apparently knocked out both engines of a new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, forcing the jet to glide to a landing on a narrow strip of grass 20 miles short of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' airport, a federal investigator said today. Passengers broke into applause for the pilot who safely brought down the <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet Tuesday without injury to the 40 or so people aboard the flight from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` Apparently the pilot ran into a hail storm and that knocked the engines out,'' said J.O. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` The damage that was caused by the denting of the -LRB- jet turbine -RRB- blades was probably the major factor in the loss of power,'' he said. The 3-week-old <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300 jet remained on the grassy strip where it glided to a stop between an irrigation canal and a ship channel. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION> officials are investigating. `` I suspect they'll probably grade -LRB- the strip -RRB- down and fly it out later,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` Except for the engines, the plane apparently suffered no damage.'' At the time of the flight, the entire <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region was under <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> warnings for severe thunderstorms, including hail and high winds, for several hours. Storm clouds were reported as high as 50,000 feet. `` The plane was going up and down, sideways, and twisting,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, 52, a Baptist missionary. `` Lightning was everywhere. The lights went out on the plane and the engine died. Everyone thought it was over. `` As the pilot said, ` By the grace of God, I got this sucker on the ground,''' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said after the smooth landing. <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, has business offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The flight had made a stop in the Central American country of <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION> plane was at 11,000 feet when it was diverted 15 miles to the Naval Air Station at suburban <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasse </PERSON>, said a source with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The pilot then managed to restart both engines, the source said, and asked for clearance to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> International before power went out again. Flying at about 5,000 feet, the pilot then was diverted 6 miles away to the less congested <LOCATION> Lakefront </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The pilot responded with two `` Mayday'' messages and began looking for somewhere else to land, the source said. The plane came to a stop on the grounds of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> complex in eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, five miles short of <LOCATION> Lakefront </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The wings barely fit between the drainage canal and the levee. Officials have put the total number of passengers and crew aboard the craft between 45 and 36. Two witnesses said they heard no engine sounds as the plane landed. <PERSON> Saidy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> said she and other passengers showed their appreciation with a round of applause _ `` a big one.'' The pilot, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardano </PERSON>, about 35, is from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and has been with <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION> about five years, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Messina </PERSON>, the airline's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regional manager. `` He's a pretty cool captain. He does n't get flustered very easily,'' <PERSON> Messina </PERSON> said. Crew members refused to talk with reporters. `` We went through rain and severe turbulence and I thought I heard them say lightning hit the plane,'' said passenger July <PERSON> Mora </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Officials could not confirm the report.

 House Speaker <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> reported six-figure earnings last year but nothing from his paperback book, according to financial records of all <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members made public today. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book figures in a call for a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee investigation. Incomes of more than $ 100,000 were the rule for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, whose official salary was $ 87,483 in 1987. But there were some exceptions. The government watchdog group <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> has asked for the probe into <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s earnings from `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' Published reports have said that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has been paid royalties of 55 percent from the 1985 book, far above the normal 10 percent to 15 percent authors receive. Common Cause president <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> last week asked for an investigation of whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s campaign committees were involved in publishing or selling the book, which could be a violation of House or other federal conflict-of-interest rules. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat indicated today that publication of the book had been halted at his orders. The speaker said that long-time campaign supporter <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who published the book, `` wanted last year to reprint 20,000 more and I said no.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> added that he wanted to be free to concentrate on being speaker. `` I told <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>, it's just not worth it,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. He said he bought $ 1,300 worth of books in the last few days to be handed out to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also sent a letter Tuesday night to the ethics committee promising his cooperation if there is an investigation. `` Although I know my actions have been in full accordance with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, I am concerned that the matters raised ... have led to increased public discussion, which I believe is unwarranted,'' he said. `` Therefore, I wish to inform you ... that I will cooperate fully with any examination you may desire to make of these matters. I hope that any such review will be resolved promptly,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., has said he will make a formal request for an ethics investigation If a member makes a request, the committee is required to respond. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., has declined to comment on the possibility of such a probe by the panel, which works in secret The financial disclosure forms for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members were made public today. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s disclosure form showed his income to be between $ 168,311 and $ 176,808. His salary as speaker is $ 115,000. His assets were between $ 155,000 and $ 435,000 and his liabilities ranged from $ 105,000 to $ 220,000. He transferred investments valued between $ 140,000 and $ 385,000 to a qualified blind trust last year. He received $ 45,850 in honoraria from such lobbying groups as the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> and the Coalition Against Regressive Taxation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> gave $ 13,000 of the honoraria to charity to bring him below the limit on speaking fees _ 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> pay _ allowed to congressmen. House Democratic leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> also reported incomes well under $ 200,000. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said his earnings were in the $ 141,500 to $ 151,500 range. He had $ 28,627 in speaking fees and $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 in assets. That was offset by liabilities in the $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 range. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> bought and sold numerous blocks of stock. In January, he bought $ 8,347 worth of shares in <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and sold it 20 days later for a $ 6,185 profit. He took a $ 7.25-a-share loss on 500 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stock three days after the Oct. 19 market crash. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, reported income of $ 167,087 to $ 183,585. He had $ 61,250 in honorariums, of which he gave $ 32,500 to charities. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said he received golf clothing and accessories for his participation in three charity golf tournaments. Among House members reporting the least income were Rep. <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehlert </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who reportred earnings in the range of $ 94,071 and $ 95,020, including $ 6,537 in speaking fees. He said his assets were under $ 15,000 and that he had no liabilities. Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., reported receiving a maximum $ 99,108 income and <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, listed a top of $ 92,283 <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>'s single honorarium, $ 150, was for an article for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> went far beyond the reporting requirements, listing $ 111,358 in `` gifts'' in addition to his $ 118,556 income. The gift figure represented the value for the free defense he received from a Wahsington law firm in a libel case brought by evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> won the suit, but still had to pay $ 14,000 out of his own pocket for legal fees. And once again, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> claimed his dog, a Great <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> named Friend, as a `` priceless'' asset.

 A judge has ordered a state agency to return about $ 800,000 in sales taxes he said was wrongfully imposed on singer-songwriter <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and the rock group <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. An attorney for Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said the decision by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> could open the way for recoveries by other recording artists. The state had assessed the 6 percent sales tax on the theory that artists `` sell'' their master recordings to record companies in exchange for royalties. The state called the master recordings `` tangible personal property.'' Attorneys for Miss <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and the duo <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, composed of <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunnell </PERSON>, had argued that they were not paid for their master recordings but rather for personal services and are thus not subject to a sales tax. The state Board of Equalization began applying the sales tax to recording artists in the early 1970s. State legislation prohibited the practice in regard to records issued after Jan. 1, 1976, but the board continued to tax artists on recordings made before that date. Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that several other performers, including <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, have litigation that could be affected by the case decided May 4.

Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, who has been representing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in international Olympic discussions, said in an interview on Tuesday there is an `` extraordinary potential threat posed by the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>.'' Concern about North Korean moves to disrupt the games has been heightened since late 1987, when that communist country was blamed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials for the bombing of a South Korean jetliner with 115 people aboard. Asked if security officials remained concerned that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> might try to disrupt the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said, `` We're taking them -LRB- possible threats -RRB- with total seriousness, logically so. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s realization that South Korean organizers are planning the games `` in a very excellent fashion'' has `` increased the frustration and bitterness of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> added. North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been bitter foes since the late 1940s when the country was partitioned. Even if the Olympics were n't being held in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, there would still be worries about terrorism by well-known nationalist groups `` You have this increase in Sikh terrorism, the lashing out at almost any <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION>; the Armenian terrorists periodically try attacks on Turks; the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and their activities; the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> _ going back to <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> _ all of these are inherently out there: the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the Italian Red Brigades,'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been working on security since 1984 and should be able to handle the job when the games are held Sept. 17-Oct. 2 `` I see no problem that I would attribute to indifference or complacency,'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said. `` The problem would be just how efficient the overall operation is, pitted against whatever actions a couple of terrorist groups might take.'' Despite the concern about North Korean disruption efforts, Olympic organizers are keeping the door open to that country's participation in the games, even though the official deadline for signing up passed in January `` Quite frankly, I think if the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> announced the day before the games that they were sending down 500 athletes, they would come across the border unmolested,'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said. `` There's no real deadline.'' <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seychelles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> have also failed to sign up for the games. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said he was not optimistic <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> would decide to take part, because of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s close ties to North Korean leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>. `` If <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> were being practical rather than having a dogmatic, we're told, special relationship with <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, he'd have in mind the excellence of the Cuban boxing team, their volleyball team, their men's handball team, some of their track and field people, plus baseball,'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said. `` Keeping in mind the excellence of these athletes it would be to his advantage in terms of international stature to have them on center stage. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> -RRB- seems to have his priorities screwed up right now; I guess we ca n't be too optimistic.''

<HEAD>Hopkins Researchers To Test Blood Of 10,000 Inmates For AIDS Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The blood of 10,000 new inmates from across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be tested this summer as part of an effort to measure the spread of the disease among prisoners. `` This study is not intended to identify people or identify risk groups,'' said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullrich </PERSON>, coordinator of the project at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` The purpose of the study is to find out the prevalence rates of human immunodeficiency virus infection of people coming into the prison system so the systems can plan for what they are coming up against.'' The study is being funded under a $ 332,000 grant from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The blood samples will be coded to ensure neither inmates nor prison officials learn who is infected, Ms. <PERSON> Ullrich </PERSON> said. Information about sexual orientation or drug use will not be collected. The prisoner's age, gender, entrance date, length of sentence and offense will be known. That will give prison officials a broad profile of HIV-infected patients, researchers said. Results should help prison officials project the number of inmates who may eventually develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome and, in turn, plan services and prevention programs, Ms. <PERSON> Ullrich </PERSON> said. Doctors are unsure exactly what percentage of HIV-infected people will develop AIDS, but many experts believe the figure is at least half. AIDS attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a variety of infections. Dr. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forham </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, medical director of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>, said the study is the first survey of HIV-infection among inmates in a geographically diverse slice of the nation's prisons In a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, AIDS cases in prisons rose 59 percent in the year ending Oct. 1, 1987 -LRB- from 1,232 to 1,964 cases -RRB-, compared with a 61 percent increase in the general population -LRB- 26,002 to 41,770 -RRB-. The survey was based on reports from 70 federal, state and local correctional systems. The survey, however, did not measure the prevalence of HIV infection in the prison population, the only reliable predictor of how many inmates may develop AIDS. The <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> study will screen the blood of 1,000 inmates entering each of 10 prisons. The study will be repeated next year. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> investigators have said they not identify the prisons until the study is complete. Participating prisons will siphon off a small amount of the blood that is already routinely drawn to test for syphilis, gonorrhea, anemia and other diseases. The samples will be shipped to <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Federal Pollution-Fighters Find Bad Air in Their Own Offices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many of the nation's pollution-fighters at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> have been gasping and wheezing from an air pollution problem apparently caused by new carpeting. Sixty-five employees have sought medical attention and seven ca n't enter the building at all because of their reactions when they do, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirzy </PERSON>, president-elect of Local 2050 of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Hirzy </PERSON> said he was `` 90 percent certain'' the reactions came from exposure to phenylcyclohexene, a gas given off by the backing of new rugs the agency has been installing in the building used by 5,100 employees. `` From talk in the halls, I would guess that the number affected is at least 100,'' but not all have reported to the agency's health office, <PERSON> Hirzy </PERSON> said. The agency has stopped putting in new carpets, but <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grizzle </PERSON>, assistant administrator for administration, said phenylcyclohexene had not been fixed definitely as the cause of the problem and `` I do n't see any reason to rip up the carpets until we are sure.'' So far, tests have shown `` nothing above background levels of any toxic chemicals,'' <PERSON> Grizzle </PERSON> said, but the results of tests for phenylcyclohexene are not yet known. <PERSON> Hirzy </PERSON> said tests of the air of a warehouse containing about 175 remaining rolls of carpet showed a concentration of 60 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. The odor of the gas can be detected at concentrations of as little as 1 ppb to 3 ppb. About 100 rolls of carpet already have been installed. Little is known about the effects of phenylcyclohexene and there are no standards for workplace exposure, but there is `` some indication'' that it damages lung tissue and intestinal mucous membranes in laboratory animals, said <PERSON> Hirzy </PERSON>, a chemist. The agency has not yet decided what to do about the seven employees who ca n't enter the building. Some are on sick leave, some are using vacation time and some are being permitted to work at home, <PERSON> Hirzy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grizzle </PERSON>, however, said, `` We are giving our employees the maximum relief we can and help with workmens' compensation cases at the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'' while the agency tries to decide on a policy. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has asked the government's housekeeping agency, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, for space elsewhere if it is forced to relocate employees, he said. <PERSON> Hirzy </PERSON> said the union had been pressing for removal of the new carpets, but was rebuffed in a `` very stormy'' meeting of the union-management facilities advisory committee on April 28. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials proposed to steam-clean the new carpets, air them out and re-lay them, <PERSON> Hirzy </PERSON> said. `` Not only will it not work, it does n't make sense from a public policy standpoint. It's not the job of government employees to be used as test animals.'' Industrial hygienists say the `` sick building'' problem like <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s is often caused by poor ventilation. <PERSON> Grizzle </PERSON> said, `` I have asked our folks to make sure we are doing everything we can to improve ventilation. I am told the dampers are open as far as they can go. I am just a layman, but it does seem to me we lack fresh air in here.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> building, which was constructed in 1971 near the waterfront in the city's southwestern section, is almost totally sealed. Many of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s employees work in cramped quarters in offices without windows, and those who rank high enough to rate a window find they can not open it. <PERSON> Grizzle </PERSON> said the agency has 125 square feet per employee, below the 135 square feet <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> specifies for new offices.

 <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> kept her husband out late in violation of a court order and then got into a scuffle with a nurse, leading to her second arrest, police said. The wife of former Metropolitan Opera impressario Sir <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> was charged with violating the court order of protection and third-degree assault, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. She was supposed to have her 86-year-old husband, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, back to their apartment by 9 p.m., but was about two hours late Tuesday, said <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, who did not know where the couple had been. `` Then when she did return, she got involved in a dispute with a 40-year-old nurse,'' pushing her against a wall and bruising her head, he said. The nurse declined treatment. Security guards at the apartment house called police, he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, 48, was arrested May 12 after she allegedly violated the court order issued three days before by state Judge <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON>. The judge ordered that she stay away from her husband for six hours a day so nurses can care for him.

Mrs. <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> is in a civil court fight with her husband's lawyer, who charges she has abused <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> and has asked the judge to annul the Bings' 1 -LCB- - year-old marriage

 Life spans up to 200 and plentiful food, but a growing gap between rich and poor _ those are among the predictions for the year 2038 from some prominent people.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Backs Proposal for Visas to Those Separated by Amnesty
Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A congressman said Wednesday he favors a proposal by immigration officials to set aside up to 200,000 visas to spouses and children who did n't qualify for amnesty but whose relatives did. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he plans to incorporate the plan of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> into legislation he introduced with two other congressmen. `` It's humane, it's progressive, it's an excellent program and it will make the lives of hundreds of thousands of people easier'' because it will keep family units together, said <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>. Under the visa plan favored by <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, once an illegal immigrant obtains permanent residency under the amnesty program, immediate family members would qualify for permanent resident status rather than facing lengthy waits. The average wait for legal status for immigrants from most countries is 1 -LCB- years and there is a 10-year wait for spouses and children of permanent residents who want to immigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> says the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 does not allow it to grant a special benefit to ineligible family members and that the agency must treat each case individually. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> is allowing relatives to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> indefinitely for humanitarian reasons under voluntary departure status. The 1986 law allows illegal aliens who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before Jan. 1, 1982 and who have lived here since to qualify for amnesty under a one-year program that ended May 4. Some 1.6 million people applied.

 Questioning of prospective jurors for former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s criminal trial neared completion today, with one woman making the first cut after saying she was embarrassed by some of his remarks in office. `` He did n't seem to have tact in talking to people,'' said the prospective juror, who added that she voted for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in 1986. She mentioned his description last year of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a `` Christian'' nation and added, `` I did feel some embarrassment.'' However, the woman said she wondered whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was `` set up'' in his impeachment trial, which concluded with the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> removing him April 4. She said she believed she could be fair, and was accepted as a possible juror. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother and 1986 campaign treasurer, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, are charged with concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. Sixteen prospective jurors were chosen Tuesday, and the questioning could be completed today. <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said he probably would stop when 24 acceptable panelists are found. Peremptory eliminations by the prosecution and defense then would be the last step in choosing the eight-member jury plus four alternates. Another possible panelist was accepted today after saying she bought a car from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> dealership that `` burned up'' after being serviced there. One man was excused after saying he had signed a <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> recall petition. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> watched intently today as the judge, prosecution and defense questioned the individual potential jurors. On Tuesday, the former governor told reporters he was `` just a stoic observer.'' One prospective juror who was accepted Tuesday said she felt `` sympathy'' for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, while others said they did not believe he should have faced recall from the governorship so soon after he took office in January 1987. Another prospective panelist said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> `` has had a very big mouth through this whole thing ... -LRB- and -RRB- got himself into a lot of trouble because of the way he was so hard-headed.'' Prosecutors unsuccessfully sought to exclude her. One man said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> seemed to make `` goofs, mistakes, errors, bad judgment, that has nothing to do with his integrity.'' All the prospective jurors, however, said they believed they could be fair in the trial. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> faces six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents, and faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on all counts. His brother faces three similar counts and up to 9 -LCB- years if convicted of all three. The former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor and his brother have denied all wrongdoing in failing to report the loan from a <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> developer. Opening statements are scheduled for June 2, the day after the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is to hear arguments on the defense's request that the charges be returned to the state grand jury for a new determination of probable cause. The original pool of 99 possible jurors was narrowed to 51 on Monday after lawyers and <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> examined questionnaires filled out last week. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was removed from office April 4 when the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him on two impeachment counts of misusing a protocol fund and of obstructing justice. He was impeached in connection with the $ 350,000 loan, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided not to hear the charge for fear of prejudicing the criminal trial.

 Intelligence operatives floated a plan in 1985 to send agents to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to seize a man believed to be behind the kidnapping of Americans in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> torpedoed the proposal, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official and a broadcast report said Wednesday. American intelligence received word in the autumn of 1985 that <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> linked to terrorist attacks, was visiting <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and proposed that he be abducted to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trial, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, fearing the action would cause a major blowup in U.S.-French relations, argued successfully against the plan and a decision was made to ask <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> authorities to arrest <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> did not act on the request, the official said. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, which first disclosed the plan in a broadcast Wednesday morning, said its sources disagreed on whether President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved the plan. At any rate, the broadcast said, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> scuttled the proposal. <ORGANIZATION> NPR </ORGANIZATION> said the idea was conceived by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, then director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, but that it was never completely proven that <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> at the time his abduction was to be carried out. In early 1986, following a second report of <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>'s presence in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, local authorities did act on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request and went to a hotel to arrest him. But instead of a Lebanese terrorist, police found a family of vacationers, <ORGANIZATION> NPR </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON> has been identified by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> terrorism experts as the leader of <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, an Iranian-backed group held responsible for the kidnapping of westerners in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Chief Middle East Correspondent <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and several other Americans. <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on charges of participating in the June 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner and the killing of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, one of the passengers. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have also said they suspect that <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON> was involved in last month's hijacking of a Kuwaiti jetliner, which was held for two weeks by gunmen demanding the release of more than two dozen Shiite Moslems being held on terrorism charges in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mugniyeh </PERSON>'s brother-in-law is said to be one of the prisoners. The plane hijackers disappeared in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> after they released their remaining hostages.

<HEAD>Tax Threat Was Key To Defeat Of New City Plan</HEAD>

 Fear of higher taxes was the key factor behind voters' rejection of the proposed new city of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, spokesmen for both sides said. The measure, which was fought by local hotel-casino interests, lost by a 1,001-802 vote in a special election Tuesday in this mountain resort area. The proposed city would have embraced the casino area of <LOCATION> Stateline </LOCATION> and smaller communities along about 15 miles of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>'s southeastern shore. It would have had a population of about 6,500. `` The tax scare did it,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bigham </PERSON>, a leader of the movement to create the city. He also blamed casinos for the outcome. `` The casinos scared their employees into voting against the city, saying there would be chaos,'' said <PERSON> Bigham </PERSON>, a local bank manager. The leader of the opposition, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nino </PERSON>, said he was very pleased with the vote. `` Our arguments were more credible, particularly regarding a tax increase,'' he said. The opposition's vigorous advertising campaign received financial support from the <LOCATION> Stateline </LOCATION> casinos, whose tax burden <PERSON> Nino </PERSON> said would rise by at least $ 300,000 yearly under a city government. Commissioners of <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which would have lost about $ 1.8 million in yearly tax revenue to the city, mostly from the large <LOCATION> Stateline </LOCATION> casinos, had advised voters to reject the plan. `` We believed there was going to be a substantial tax increase,'' said <PERSON> Nino </PERSON>, who runs a property management business. `` People will pay more for more but we did n't see where there was going to be more. We saw the same or less.'' The proposal lost in all the lakeshore communities, although proponents had argued that those communities, which comprise 25 percent of <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s population, do not receive a share in services proportionate to the tax revenue they contribute. The issue prompted an unusually high turnout of 60 percent, said <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Clerk <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. She said a normal turnout was 35-40 percent.

 Three men stole 81 pay telephones, altered their electronics and reinstalled them elsewhere, enabling one of the thieves to continue collecting callers' money, police said. The alleged ringleader, <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Vagnoni </PERSON>, 60, changed the locks on the coin boxes, removed labels identifying the owner and changed a computer chip inside, police said. The telephones were valueda at $ 265,275; the amount of money received by operating them illegally could not be determined, police said. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> charged Tuesday that <PERSON> Vagnoni </PERSON> paid <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, 22, to steal phones for him at $ 150 each throughout <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The stolen telephones were then operated by <PERSON> Need-a-Phone </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> pay telephone company in which <PERSON> Vagnoni </PERSON> is a silent partner, police said. Other partners were unaware of the activities, police said. About one-quarter of the telephones belonged to Bell of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, while the remainder belonged to members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pay-Phone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a network of private companies that operate pay telephones. The three men were charged with 60 counts each of theft, conspiracy and unlawful use of computers. The case broke in February when police Sgt. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levins </PERSON> spotted <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> and <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> dislodging a telephone and its steel base, said Detective <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>. An investigation traced the men to <PERSON> Vagnoni </PERSON>, he said. `` Bystanders would spot the two men, but they appeared to be utility people,'' said Deputy Police Commissioner <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` It was when the owners of the equipment came by to service the phones and found the equipment gone that a pattern began to be noticed.''

 A Palestinian general strike shut down the occupied territories Wednesday and the Israeli army imposed curfews that confined 200,000 Arabs to their homes. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, chief of staff, said the army has punished dozens of soldiers for violating orders since the Arab rebellion began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate, but the army has issued rules on when soldiers are allowed to fire on or beat protesters. <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> also said the violence has lessened the influence of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in the territories, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 war, and undermined his usefulness in peace negotiations. `` The uprising in the territories has weakened <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s ... position as a potential partner for negotiations,'' he told foreign reporters. `` We hear voices today that King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is retreating from positions he had taken before the uprising began.'' Soldiers shot a Palestinian youth during a clash with young Arabs hurling rocks and bottles in the Nur Shams refugee camp near <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army said. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Rafidiyeh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said he was critically wounded in the chest. Hundreds of Arabs have been wounded since the rebellion began among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. At least 195 have been killed, and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a Jewish settler also have been slain. Indefinite curfews were imposed on the Dheishe refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and on nine camps and villages in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Underground leaders called the one-day strike in a leaflet signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to mark the end of mourning for <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander, 40 days after he was assassinated at his home in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, whose code name was <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, spent his boyhood in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. His cousin <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, who lives there, said soldiers barred mourners from attending a reception in the slain leader's honor. `` The army is outside our house,'' <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> said by telephone from his home, where the reception was to have been held. `` They turned back anyone who came here.'' He said 10 army jeeps and other military vehicles were outside his house and soldiers with megaphones ordered all residents on his street to remain indoors. Stores were closed throughout the territories and in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> took from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in 1967 and has formally annexed. Public transport was halted and most Palestinians who have jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stayed home. Vendors selling newspapers and doughnut-shaped bread covered with sesame seeds, an Arab staple, provided the only signs of commercial activity. Classes were conducted at kindergartens and elementary schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which were allowed to open Monday for the first time in nearly four months. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafovicz </PERSON>, spokesman for the military government, said about 90 percent of the 200,000 students showed up Wednesday. `` This shows the strengthening of the military government,'' he said. In the leaflet that called the strike, however, underground leaders said the school re-opening was a victory and urged children to attend. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the army threatened <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> property owners with up to five years in jail if they failed to wash anti-Israeli graffiti off their buildings and remove <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, which are outlawed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Army spokesmen had no immediate comment on the report, which also said those who did not comply could be fined 15,000 shekels -LRB- $ 9,670 -RRB-. A Jewish settler was charged with manslaughter Wednesday in the fatal shooting of a Palestinian shepherd May 5 near <LOCATION> Shiloh </LOCATION>, a Jewish settlement in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. It quoted the charge sheet, <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> fired at Arab shepherds despite their shouts that they would stop grazing sheep on disputed land near <LOCATION> Shiloh </LOCATION>, the radio said. One shepherd was killed and another wounded. Government prosecutors also charged two editors of the left-wing newspaper <PERSON> Derech </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanitzotz </PERSON> with membership in a guerrilla organization and maintaining contacts with a foreign agent, the radio said. <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Efrat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Assaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Adiv </PERSON>, and two other staff members charged earlier this week, face up to 40 years in jail if convicted.

 The former <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer at the controls during the worst crash in <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> history pleaded guilty today to a federal charge of conspiring to obstruct an investigation of the wreck. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, 34, already is serving a five-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to a state charge of manslaughter for running a string of locomotives past a signal and into the path of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train. Sixteen people were killed and 175 were injured in the Jan. 4, 1987 crash near <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, Md. Gates could receive up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine at sentencing July 15. Gates' public defender, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, called the federal charges `` morally unjust.'' Gates was indicted March 31, two days after pleading guilty to the state charges. `` It amounts to kicking the dog when he's down,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>. In exchange for his guilty plea to conspiracy, charges of obstruction and making false statements were dropped. Under the plea bargain, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, prosecutors will recommend a five-year sentence to be served after <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>' state term. Gates was accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators in denying that he and brakeman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> had smoked marijuana while operating the train. The federal indictment also accused Gates of lying about having tested cab signals to make sure they were in working order. <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> received state and federal immunity for his cooperation in the investigation. The crash prompted the introduction of federal legislation to tighten regulation of train crews. The legislation, passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, would require train licenses for engineers, make it illegal for crews to tamper with safety devices and give the government more clout in handling safety violations. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve the legislation this week as well. Gates, in state court, admitted he failed to replace a cab warning light bulb and fix a whistle that was taped over to keep it from sounding. Either warning device would have alerted him to the stop signals, officials said.

 Economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> says he and a Soviet counterpart, in collaborating on a new book, found that both their countries are experiencing what they call superpower syndrome. <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> and Soviet economist <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON>, who have known each other for more than 20 years, wanted to find out whether each could write fairly about the other's economic system, <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> said. Under a joint publication agreement, the book, `` Capitalism, Communism and Coexistence: From the Bitter Past to a Better Prospect,'' is being released in both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Today, <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> said, there are many similarities between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and the book offers hope that both sides can work together. One of those similarities, he said, is the `` superpower syndrome.'' `` Both powers, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, have recently collided with the determination of other peoples everywhere to conduct their own governments and run their own lives,'' he said. <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>, 79, and <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON>, 61, were in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Wednesday to discuss the book at an awards breakfast sponsored by Clergy and Laity Concerned, an interfaith group. The book is compiled from discussions <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON> conducted at <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>'s summer home in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. `` We wanted to see whether we could write a book that dealt fairly and squarely with the problems of the two systems,'' <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> said Tuesday night in a telephone interview from his hotel. <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> said the topics of the discussions include past achievements of socialism and capitalism, the current problems of both systems and suggested reforms for those problems. <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, has taught at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> universities and is the author of more than 20 books on economics and other subjects. He has also held a number of governmental posts including that of ambassador to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> from 1961-63. <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON> is staff editor of the World Marxist Review, published in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, and author of a number of books, including an economic comparison of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Hindu Migrant Workers Flee Punjab After Sikh Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARBAKSH SINGH NANDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MAJJAT, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of Hindu migrant workers are fleeing <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> following attacks by Sikh extremists who are waging a war of terror in their quest for a separate homeland. Police say 65 migrant laborers have been killed by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> gunmen in the past week. `` Even if I have to die at this age, I must die among my relatives,'' said <PERSON> Piara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ram </PERSON>, 26, who was leaving for his home in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state. `` There would be someone to cry for me.'' The migrant workers' departure could seriously undermine <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>'s economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Punjab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates the state employs about 700,000 migrant workers a year, most for planting and harvesting in the nation's richest agricultural state. Several sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about one-third have left since the Sikh extremists' raids escalated earlier this month. The state government acknowledges laborers have returned home but gives no figures. Construction work has nearly stopped on a major canal designed to carry <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> river water to neighboring states, and even migrant rickshaw pullers and other manual laborers are leaving. Although radical Sikhs have frequently attacked Hindus in their six-year struggle for greater autonomy or an independent nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, they started singling out <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> migrnt laborers during the police siege of the Golden Temple. The 10-day siege, aimed at driving armed Sikhs out of the shrine, ended May 18 after more than 200 Sikh extremists and their supporters surrendered. Although <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> officials have pledged to protect the migrants _ who come mainly from the poor northern states of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orissa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> _ many say they are returning home rather than face more terrorism by Sikh extremists. Police say the attacks may have a dual purpose: to reduce the number of Hindus in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and to undermine the state's economy. The attacks began May 17 when 31 men and women working on the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal were shot to death by Sikhs at their camp near <LOCATION> Majjat </LOCATION>, 30 miles northwest of the state capital at <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. The gunmen then burned the bodies. Seventy other camp workers fled to nearby fields and hid from the gunmen. A day later, they begged the government to arrange for their return to <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orissa </LOCATION> states. The attack was claimed by the <ORGANIZATION> Khalistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest of a dozen Sikh extremist groups active in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. In a note left with the bodies, the group said it avenging the siege of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and threatened more reprisals. The charred bodies of the 31 laborers remain in the deserted campsite, and bloodstains still can be seen on the muddy footpaths leading to their tents. The canal project they were working on has lost almost 7,500 of its 10,000 workers, according to figures provided by the canal headquarters at <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. The Sikh militants, and some Sikh moderates, oppose the canal because it is designed to carry water from <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> to the neighboring states of <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION>. The militants contend it will reduce the water available for irrigation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a `` breadbasket'' state of wheat fields, rice paddies and sugar cane plantations. <PERSON> Romesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, a contractor on two bridges being built along the canal, said work was all but stopped on the canal and could not be resumed unless the migrants were lured back to the project. The average migrant worker in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> earns betweeen $ 38 and $ 46 per month. Most send money home to support their families. Jobs in their native states are hard to find and pay much less. <PERSON> Lubhaya </PERSON>, a rickshaw puller, worked for seven years in <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION>, the district capital, but was at the railway station this week waiting for a train. He said he was leaving `` the death land of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>'' for good. <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, owner of a brick kiln in <LOCATION> Ropar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> just north of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, said many of his 35 migrant employees have left. <PERSON> Chaman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON>, another kiln owner, estimated that two-thirds of the district's 1,700 migrant kiln workers have fled. An official at the state's Home Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, said special camps would be set up for migrants to make them feel more secure. In <LOCATION> Ropar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, Deputy Commissioner <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundal </PERSON> said security would be provided for the canal workers' camps, and he urged laborers to stay. `` If you do n't work here, what will you or your family members eat?'' he asked them. He did not say when the security would be provided.

 Rising production costs and cutbacks in federal payments are keeping up the pressure on farmers this year, says a new outlook report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Net cash income of farmers is forecast at $ 50 billion to $ 55 billion this year, down from the record of $ 57 billion in 1987, the report released Tuesday said. That is unchanged from <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s previous forecasts The department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> added that underlying the forecast are improvements in several of agriculture's key fundamentals: _ Use of most of the major commodities has increased, thereby reducing burdensome stockpiles. _ Market prices for those commodities are approaching or are higher the government's support levels. _ Higher cattle prices have offset minor declines in production. _ Interest rates have continued to be moderate. _ Total farm debt is declining for the fifth consecutive year, indicating further gains in the financial position of operators. `` Production expenses are expected to rise, after declining at an unprecedented rate the last three years,'' the report said. Spring fertilizer prices were up 10 percent from a year ago, and those `` will be felt most by corn and barley producers, whose outlays for fertilizer make up 38 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of variable costs,'' the report said. `` The Corn Belt will be the region most affected.'' Energy expenses may rise about 5 percent this year, with cash grain, and cattle and hog operations accounting for more than 60 percent of fuel costs last year. Again, the Corn Belt will be most affected. Thus, the drop in 1988 net cash income _ the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses _ will be mostly due to higher cash expenses outweighing greater cash receipts from the sale of crops and livestock. Further, the report said, direct payments to farmers in 1988 are expected to drop by as much as 20 percent from last year's $ 17 billion. Despite the dip in cash income this year, analysts said the balance sheet of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture continues to show improvement from the hard-pressed economy of a few years ago. `` With improving income, lower debt and adequate credit for farm real estate loans, buyers are coming back into the real estate market,'' the report said. `` With recent improvements in cash flow, many land sales have been for cash.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has hired a new administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> under an arrangement that gives him an annual benefits package worth $ 126,500 a year at taxpayer expense. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON>, 59, is leaving his job as head of the department of animal, dairy and veterinary sciences at <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to take over the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> ARS </ORGANIZATION>, at a salary of $ 77,500. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> announced the appointment on April 15. But that is only part of the story, says <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> editor who writes a twice-monthly newsletter that often includes gadfly accounts of department goings-on. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> disclosed in his latest issue that <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON> will continue to draw a federal pension of about $ 35,000 a year, earned in 27 years on the job with ARS from 1956 to 1984, when he retired and went to work for <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. The Plowman job package involves an `` IPA'' maneuver provided by the federal Intergovernmental Personnel Act, which allows state governments to get the loan of federal experts or send their employees to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on a short-term basis. In this particular case, confirmed Tuesday by agency officials, <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON> technically will be on loan from the university, which will pay his salary while in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, in turn, will reimburse the university $ 77,500 a year. <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON> also will get $ 14,000 a year in federal per diem to help pay moving expenses and make up for higher living costs in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area. Normally, <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON> would give up his federal retirement income while returning to work at the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency. But under the IPA arrangement, <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON> will be able keep his pension income. Although the `` loan'' deal with <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> is for a year, officials said the contract is renewable on the same terms. Thus, <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON>'s prospective income of $ 126,500 a year is substantially more than <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s pay of $ 99,500 or members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who get $ 89,500 a year. If <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON> converts over to federal employment, severing his connection with <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, he automatically would be cut off from his old pension benefits _ at least until he retires again from federal service.

 Rains last month brought temporary relief to many parched areas of the West where the outlook for this summer's water supply had been poor, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` While drought continues in many areas, it certainly is good to see an increase in rainfall,'' Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. `` We're hoping this change will develop into a long-term pattern. Scaling said precipitation in April was near to above normal in most areas west of the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> got above-normal precipitation, and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> received twice its April average. `` Reservoir storage is very good in the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> basins,'' he said. `` We also expect reservoirs in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to fill.'' But Scaling said the water supply outlook in other areas is not nearly so bright. `` Some areas in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> will be facing water supply shortages as early as next month,'' he said. `` There are also sections of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that remain very dry despite the recent increase in precipitation.'' Scaling added: `` It's going to take a lot more than just one good month of precipitation to ease the drought in those areas.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will send diplomats to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to take up consular duties for the first time in 21 years, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday. Another Ministry official told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> he hoped the agreement between the two countries would eventually lead to full diplomatic ties. The official, political adviser <PERSON> Nimrod </PERSON> <PERSON> Novick </PERSON>, declined to describe the pact as a breakthrough in <LOCATION> Soviet-Israeli </LOCATION> relations. `` What we are talking about is dipping ourselves in the water to check if it is hot or cold,'' he said. `` It remains to be seen when our delegates reach <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, how well they will be received.'' The Soviets agreed to issue visas to the Israeli diplomats during a secret meeting Monday in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> told the station. The other ministry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said diplomats from the Jewish state could leave for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> capital as early as next week. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> broke ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> when the Jewish state captured the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> allies in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. This week's agreement came 10 months after Soviet consular officials began operating from the Finnish Embassy in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Novick </PERSON>, who negotiated for the visas, said the Soviets resisted Israeli efforts to have the diplomats handle visas to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for Soviet Jewish emigres. `` It looked like it was broadening things to the Soviets,'' he said. But he added that the Soviets agreed not to restrict other contacts between the Israelis and Soviet Jews. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s diplomats will administer an embassy building that has been vacant since 1967 but for which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has continued to pay monthly rent, <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> said. The diplomats, up to six in number, will work from the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, where visas for Jewish emigres are processed, according to sources quoted by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media. The agreement followed two months of secret contacts with <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrasov </PERSON>, deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> said In the past two years, <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders have improved ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to try to gain a role in peace efforts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. That led to the agreement nearly a year ago for the eight-member consular team to come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

Somebody must be kidding. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is accused ... of taking $ 4.6 million in payoffs from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel to protect cocaine shipments, launder money, supply drug laboratories and shelter the gang's leaders from law enforcement Why should it bother him to go into `` exile'' until 1990? He will simply leave his corrupt cronies in place to keep the drugs and money flowing, while he serves his time in some pleasure spot. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` war against drugs'' has been anything but successful and dismissing the indictments would indicate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> condones drug trafficking.

 May 20 Providence -LRB- <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal-Bulletin on the addictiveness of smoking: On the surface, the essence of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surgeon general's annual report on smoking _ that nicotine is potently addictive _ is nothing new. Anyone who has ever smoked regularly then tried to stop knows painfully well the hold nicotine has on people. Yet this year's report equates the addiction of nicotine to that of heroin and cocaine, and in the process raises some eyebrows. Can it really be as difficult to give up smoking as it is to stop shooting up with heroin? With such a comparison is n't there a danger that now smokers will begin to be equated with drug users and, perhaps, shunned by employers _ when their functioning under the influence of nicotine has no relation to one's functioning under that, say, of heroin? Adults who choose to indulge their habit ... ought to be free to do so, except in outlawed premises, for in their cases they are the only ones affected.

 May 22 <LOCATION> Alamogordo </LOCATION> -LRB- N.M. -RRB- Daily News on a proposal to legalize drugs: Election year posturing drives politicians' anti-drug rhetoric to hysteria levels, some very extreme and absurd ideas have gained unwarranted respectability. Chief among these is the notion that legalizing heroin, cocaine and other addictive substances will alleviate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s alarming drug problem. The logic behind this proposal is identical to giving a drunk another drink to cure his alcoholism. Making illicit narcotics legal, and thus cheaper and even more readily available, would not discourage drug abuse. On the contrary, legalization would cause consumption to soar and magnify to a dangerous degree the full range of personal and societal destruction caused by drug use.

The committee decreed, for the first time in the memory of those who serve on it, that no money will be appropriated for the next fiscal year to start construction of new water or energy projects.

It's just that committee members felt constrained to honor a two-year agreement reached at last December's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House-Congress </ORGANIZATION> budget summit to keep costs down to reduce the federal deficit. ... But this being an election year, few politicians are eager to endorse increased taxes, even to satisfy the desires of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members who gain bragging rights for federally funded projects that benefit their districts and states. ... It's gratifying that, however brief and limited it may be, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decided to give taxpayers a break from higher pork-barrel spending.

But wait a minute. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is in its 66th straight month of the longest and strongest recovery in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peacetime history.

 May 23 <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Wis. -RRB- Sentinel on the drug war: The wages of sin can be an effective weapon in the war against crime _ but less so in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. That's because money or property seized from criminals in drug raids is n't kept by state or local law enforcement agencies for use in future drug buys, but is turned over to the state school fund. As a result, and because the state civil forfeiture proceeding takes longer than the federal procedure, local prosecutors often involve federal authorities in the cases. After custody of money has been obtained by federal officials, they return the cash to local authorities, keeping 10 percent to 20 percent for administrative costs. That 10 percent to 20 percent could be used here in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> if state law was changed to speed things up and to allow local agencies to keep the loot they seize. The loss to the school fund probably would be negligible, considering that local authorities now use the federal option anyway. Far from negligible would be the gain if that money helped capture another drug trafficker.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will begin purchasing Nicaraguan currency this week for distribution to the Contra rebels to buy food and clothing, despite a plea from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats to drop the idea, a spokesman for the aid program said Wednesday. The Democrats met in a closed-door caucus Wednesday and voted to approve a resolution calling for the cash aid program to be scuttled and for food and clothing to be shipped through the <ORGANIZATION> Pan-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, or PADF, an agency with ties to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Both the Contras and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government have made public statements accepting the <ORGANIZATION> PADF </ORGANIZATION> as the delivery agent for a $ 17.7 million humanitarian aid program approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. But a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which is administering the aid, said there had been no formal request from the two sides to establish PADF as delivery agent, and that the congressional request was premature. `` There has to be a formal agreement in place,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We have said all along that the neutral delivery mechanism has to be part of an agreement between the resistance and the Sandinista government.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> added: `` It is wholly unrealistic to expect AID to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PADF </ORGANIZATION> in specific terms until there is a signed agreement or some kind of reliable public statement.'' AID plans to begin purchasing cordobas, the Nicaraguan currency, this week for distribution to rebel troops in the field as early as next week, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> added. Troops will receive about $ 1 a day each, he said. `` The first purchases will be this week, then you'll see the first movement across the border next week,'' he said, adding that the money is to be channeled through the Contra military structure. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said it is the rainy season in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and that scheduling of airdrops is unreliable, so that cash aid may have to continue even after a `` neutral'' delivery agent, as called for in the legislation, is established. The resolution approved by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats contended that `` the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is violating the ... cease-fire agreement and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cease-fire assistance program'' by providing cash, sending aid without inspection by the verification commission and by using a delivery contractor that does not meet the test of neutrality. AID continues to use a delivery company, <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION>, that has past links to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the caucus noted. The resolution called on the administration to `` make immediate arrangements for delivery of aid through the Pan-American Development Foundation.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said AID has so far delivered 600 metric tons of food, clothing and other supplies to rebel forces inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> through private contractors. The loads delivered so far have been inspected by representatives of the Roman Catholic church in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to make sure they contain no lethal supplies, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. Most of the deliveries have been made by truck, although there have been about a dozen airdrops, he said.

 Thives struck museums in two cities in the days following the biggest art theft in Dutch history, officials said Wednesday. On Sunday, thieves at <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s Biblical Museum forced open a glass showcase and stole six antique Egyptian statuettes, according to the <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handelsblad </ORGANIZATION>. The bronze and clay figures, worth an estimated $ 7,800 to $ 10,400, apparently were stolen while the museum was open, the report said. The theft came two days after thieves broke into <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> and stole three paintings estimated at up to $ 52 million, including works by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON> The theft highlighted the relatively low security at the museum which houses 3,000 mainly modern masterworks but has no night guard. The burglary triggered an electronic alarm, but it took up to 20 minutes for police and security officials to arrive on the scene. Later that day, thieves smashed a showcase and stole two jewelry items in the Dutch Literary Museum in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, according to museum director <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Korteweg </PERSON>. The stolen cameo brooch and a gold-edged medallion were worth several thousand dollars, <PERSON> Korteweg </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, adding the incident at his museum also occurred while it was open to the public. The Literary Museum, housed in the ultra-modern Royal Library complex, has electronic surveillance and a night guard, and owns a collection of manuscripts, books and other objects associated with Dutch literary figures. The Biblical Museum, which has a collection of artifacts from the Holy Land, had only one guard on duty at the time of the theft, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Economists Outline Rosier Economic Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet economists said Wednesday they have seen the future and it holds family farms, thriving foreign trade and rubles acceptable on world markets. One predicted, however, that the future is not near at hand. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON>, told reporters his liberal ideas encounter opposition that makes him feel like `` a minority of one.'' He predicted the ubiquitous symbols of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s economic ills _ long lines or lists for consumer goods _ would be around for a long time <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> said it would take at least 10 years to catch up with the demand for cars. Another economist, <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON>, said `` all of us are suffering, particularly our wives,'' who do most of the shopping. <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> was more optimistic. He said lines should become a memory in five or six years as cooperatives, a form of limited private enterprise Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> favors, help meet consumer demand. <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON>, who is with the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, has published articles in the literary journal Novy Mir advocating reforms far more radical than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s. He mentioned two at the news conference Wednesday: selling some of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s vast gold reserves for foreign currency to buy consumer goods made abroad, and letting farm families lease land from the state. The economist conceded his proposals had received only lukewarm support. `` At times I find myself in this situation, a minority of one,'' <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> said. `` These questions can be discussed, but these are not yet practical issues.'' <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON> has been particularly critical of collectivized agriculture. He said the country is moving toward increasing the number of family-run farms because of excessive bureaucracy in collective operations. `` The future belongs to family farms,'' he said, but he does not envision turning the land over to private ownership. Articles have appeared in the official press about agricultural experiments in which farm families own buildings, equipment and animals and have long-term leases on land. In collectives, members of a cooperative own buildings and machinery jointly and share in the earnings. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants to improve the collective farm in its various forms, including the idea of smaller work teams that would include the family. Making the ruble a convertible currency that could be traded freely has been debated vigorously in the official press. Some economists say it would lead to serious inflation problems because of fluctuations against other currenciews. Lack of convertibility hampers foreign trade. Foreign companies are not eager to earn rubles, which they can not use outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In order to buy the Western technology and products it needs, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must sell its own goods abroad for acceptable foreign currency. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, first deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, sounded confident that the change would come. `` We want to be sure our ruble becomes a hard currency,'' he said. <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> said the ruble should become convertible by the mid-1990s, first in the Soviet bloc and later elsewhere in the world, but prices of Soviet goods first will have to be brought into line with world markets. Another Kremlin goal is at least a doubling of foreign trade by the end of the century, he said. The volume of Soviet foreign trade with developed capitalist countries was 20 billion rubles, about $ 33 billion at the official rate, in the first three quarters of 1987.

<HEAD>Money That Led To Controversial Strip Search Of Students Turns Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The missing $ 100 bill that led to a strip search of high school students and the demotion of the official who ordered the search was found tucked in a closet of the room where it vanished last month. <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> officials do n't know how or when the money ended up in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parson </PERSON>'s classroom. The bill was still tucked inside a coin purse. `` It's been very painful,'' Principal <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarboro </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` After all we've been through, we just want to put it behind us.'' She said it appears the coin purse was taken and later stuffed into a closet. `` It definitely was not misplaced,'' <PERSON> Yarboro </PERSON> said. `` But I'm not going to draw any conclusion, because I do n't know. All we wanted was for the money to be found. It just happened a month too late.'' <PERSON> Deneen </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShields </PERSON>, 18, reported the money missing during <PERSON> Parson </PERSON>'s cooking class last month A student looking for grill cleaner during a yearly inventory found the money Tuesday in the rarely used closet, <PERSON> Parson </PERSON> said. `` It could have been there all along. I do n't know,'' he said. Miss <PERSON> DeShields </PERSON> had brought the money to school April 11 to pay for a trip to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with the school's choral group. When she reported it missing, and a search did n't find her coin purse, the 16 juniors and seniors in the class were locked in the room. Dean of Students <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> and security personnel separated the students by sex and searched them. Assistant Principal <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> helped in the search, which infuriated parents. The <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month demoted <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> to a teacher and suspended <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> for five days. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> was pleased that the money turned up. `` That's all I ever wanted,'' he said.

But we'll be more careful in the future.'' He said the club is going to become bonded and require two signatures on all checks. He said the club will `` try to have fund-raisers and hope people will give us money to pull through this. That's about all we can do right now.''

<HEAD>Truck Deregulation Said Saving Billions Without Hurting Safety,
Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The partial deregulation of the trucking industry has saved the economy tens of billions of dollars a year while having little effect on safety or service to small communities, a staff report by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> concluded Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> cited the report in calling for the removal of remaining federal and state economic restrictions on the commercial trucking industry. His views were endorsed by <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradison </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> staff study, between $ 39 billion and $ 63 billion are being saved annually because of increased competition and efficiencies flowing from the partial deregulation of the trucking industry eight years ago. `` The best available estimates ... suggest that the gains have outweighed the losses by approximately 20 to 1,'' concluded the report released by the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s bureau of economics. The commission has not formally endorsed the findings. The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 greatly eased entry into the trucking business by making it easier for a trucking company to begin operating along a particular route. In recent years applications for a route have been denied only rarely. It also has become easier for carriers to set their own rates. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> staff report by economist <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said the easing of government control over the trucking industry `` has resulted in new shipping services and greater scheduling and pricing flexibility,'' leading to increased savings and allowing shippers to better compete with foreign companies. Ms. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> acknowledged that there have been concerns about deregulation on some trucking companies as well as about truck safety and a possible decline in services to small and rural communities. The report said that despite these concerns trucking services to small communities generally have improved or remained unchanged, deregulation `` does not appear to have adversely affected safety'' and while many trucking companies have gone out of business the overall number of companies and employees in the industry has increased. The report said that while interstate commerce has benefited from deregulation, `` continued state regulation costs consumers and the economy billions of dollars annually.'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> called for additional action, `` removing the yoke of unnecessary economic regulation'' that still exists of the trucking industry. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has sought further deregulation of trucking, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> so far has not taken action. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said, states should eliminate many of their retrictions on commercial trucking. `` In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> it now costs more to ship goods from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a distance of 15 miles, than to ship interstate from <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says he may hold another summit with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> yet this year to finish work on a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles, according to a published report. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> newspaper published in its Thursday editions, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said he wants his <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners to pay more of the alliance's expenses. The interview was conducted in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and his fourth summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> figures that the START treaty, which foresees the halving of nuclear intercontinental missiles, still can be brought to completion before the end of his term,'' the conservative daily said. Advance copies of the report were provided to other media Wednesday. The German-language excerpts were translated into English by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the journalists that the Soviets are interested in concluding an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile treaty with him, rather than waiting until his successor takes over in January. `` Therefore, the president does n't exclude the possibility of a fifth summit conference with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> this year on neutral ground,'' the newspaper said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> on Wednesday en route to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in November 1985, in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> in October 1986, and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December 1987. During the interview, <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked how he gets along with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` We can discuss delicate issues without lingering on personal bad feelings. I believe there is actually a certain degree of friendship between us,'' <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying. The newspaper also said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> touched on problems facing the Americans in financing costs of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and urged that other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners share more of the burden. `` I do n't think this is an area that should cause bad blood between us,'' <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying. `` But it would be helpful if the allies would carry more of the load, especially since the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for years has declined to approve further increases for defense,'' the newspaper quoted the president as saying. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the reporters he is pleased that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or more openness in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> society, has influenced other East bloc countries. Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also made reference to last weekend's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership change in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, in which <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who had led the party 32 years, was replaced as premier by <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> had `` simply been in office too long,'' Die Welt reported.

 Asked what chance he saw for the signing of a START treaty at a fifth summit meeting with the Soviets before he leaves office on Jan. 20, 1989, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` I ca n't discount that. I certainly do n't want to say that it is impossible, because I believe we can exclude signing a START treaty at this summit.'' `` I believe however, that negotiations in this summit will bring us further, and I hope that it can be concluded while I am still in office,'' he told the newspaper. `` I also believe that the other side also thinks this way, that unnecessary delay could be caused if they had to wait until my successor becomes familiar with the job and is in the position to work with them -LRB- the Soviets -RRB-. `` Therefore, I hope that we can clear up all remaining questions during my time in office. Then it can be that we decide to sign this treaty at a new meeting and not separated by thousands of miles. `` Since we have visited each other in our home countries, we would probably decide on a neutral location,'' for the signing, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the newspaper.

<HEAD>Increase in Sales of Existing Homes at 17-Month High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of existing homes increased 4.5 percent in April, the biggest advance in 17 months, as buyers rushed to close deals before interest rates went up, a real estate trade group said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.48 million units last month, following increases of 2.5 percent in both February and March. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the association, predicted that sales would be slowed in the months ahead by rising mortgage rates. Rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages hit a low this year of 9.84 percent on Feb. 12 and have been rising since then, climbing to 10.52 percent last week, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Home prices edged down slightly in April with the median price of a home falling to $ 87,700 While this was down $ 200 from the March median sales price, it was still up from a year ago, when the median price was $ 86,000. The slight March-to-April decline in the median price masked wide regional differences. Home prices rose 5.3 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> to $ 145,100, the highest in the country. Prices were up a slight 0.4 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to a median of $ 67,500. Prices fell 4.6 percent in the West to $ 113,700 and were down 1.4 percent in the South to $ 82,100. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said the slight overall decline in home prices was an indication that prices were finally leveling off and would increase only modestly for the remainder of the year. The association is predicting that resales of existing homes will total 3.31 million this year, down 6 percent from the 3.52 million homes sold in 1987. The overall April increase was led by a 6.2 percent increase in sales in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, which climbed to an annual rate of 690,000 units. Sales were up 5.7 percent in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 1.3 million units, while the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> had a 2.3 percent increase in sales to an annual rate of 900,000. The West was the only region of the country to have a decline in sales, a drop of 1.8 percent to an annual rate of 560,000 units.

<HEAD>Two White Policemen Convicted of Murdering Black Youth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two white policemen were convicted Wednesday of murdering a black youth in what the judge described as a wanton `` beating expedition'' in a township. Warrant Officer <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> and Constable <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON> could receive the death penalty. They were expected to be sentenced later this week after arguments about extenuating circumstances. It is believed that no white policeman has ever been executed for killing a black while on duty in the black townships. The trial, which began in October, is one of the few in South African history in which white policemen have testified against colleagues facing the death penalty for alleged brutality against blacks. Justice N.W. <PERSON> Zietsman </PERSON>, who presided over the non-jury trial, said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> had led his 10-man all-white unit into a black township on a `` beating expedition,'' assaulting residents indiscriminately. He praised police investigators who pressed ahead with the case after other members of the unit initially tried to cover up the incident. Fellow officers eventually provided the key testimony against <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON>, 37. The verdict was to have been delivered Monday, but de Villiers collapsed in court and was hospitalized. He was present for Wednesday's proceedings at the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Grahamstown </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON> had been charged with two counts of murder in the killings on July 26, 1986, in the black section of <LOCATION> Cradock </LOCATION>, a town near <LOCATION> Grahamstown </LOCATION>. They were acquitted on one count but convicted of the murder of 18-year-old <PERSON> Mlungisi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON>. According to testimony, members of <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Villiers </ORGANIZATION>' anti-riot squad drank heavily, conducted a blood-oath ceremony swearing themselves to secrecy, and then made an unauthorized night foray into the township. Several blacks were assaulted at that time. However, after another bout of drinking at their base, the squad returned to the township after daybreak. <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON>, who was wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan `` Forward To <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>,'' was chased and grabbed by officers when he tried to walk away. Then he was assaulted, several officers testified. The officers said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> then ordered that <PERSON> Stuurman </PERSON> be `` taken out'' because of the severity of his injuries. They said <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON> took the youth to a riverbank and shot him in the back of the neck. The defendants contended the shooting was an accident. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON> said he did not report it immediately because he was still under the influence of alcohol. In arguing for extenuating circumstances, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON>' lawyer said his client was of below-average intelligence and drunk at the time of the shooting. <PERSON> Goosen </PERSON> testified that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after repeated exposure to violence in black townships. He also said he had an unhappy childhood during which he was often taunted about his dark complexion. The convicted men were allowed to remain free on bail of about $ 250.

 A World War II veteran accused of shooting his benefits counselor has been ordered to undergo treatment at a state hospital after being found incompetent to stand trial for murder, officials said. A jury ruled Tuesday that <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 63, of <PERSON> Stonewall </PERSON> was incompetent to stand trial on charges that he killed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettit </PERSON>, 54. State District Judge <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> committed to <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had been in the Kerr County Jail in lieu of $ 250,000 bond in the slaying Jan. 20. Jurors heard two days of testimony before deciding that the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> was incompetent to stand trial now, and that `` there is no substantial probability that he will attain competency in the foreseeable future.'' <PERSON> Pettit </PERSON> was a veterans affairs counselor for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> who was handling <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s claims. District Attorney <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was enraged by delays in his medical claims and shot <PERSON> Pettit </PERSON> in the counselor's office near the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, as <PERSON> Pettit </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, and other workers watched. Testimony Monday indicated <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> believed that <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> officials had been keeping duplicate files on him. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> claimed officials removed information from his records that showed he killed Japanese soldiers during World War II. He believed the lack of that information was keeping him from getting full disability payments, <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who had undergone treatment at the <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> hospital, had sought full medical disability instead of the partial claims he was being awarded.

<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer, already serving a five-year state prison sentence, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a federal charge of conspiring to obstruct the investigation of the worst crash in <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> history. In exchange, federal prosecutors dropped three other charges against <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, 33, was sentenced almost two months ago after he pleaded guilty to a state misdemeanor charge of manslaughter by locomotive for running a string of <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> locomotives past a signal and into the path of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train. The Jan. 4, 1987, crash near Chase killed 16 people and injured 175 others. Former <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> brakeman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>, with whom authorities say <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> conspired, received state and federal immunity for his cooperation in the investigation. In the plea agreement, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> be sentenced to a five-year prison term to be served consecutively with his state sentence. The maximum penalty on the conspiracy charge is five years and a $ 250,000 fine. Sentencing is scheduled July 15. The charges which were dropped included obstruction of justice and two counts of making false statements. In the statement of facts the prosecutor read into the record Wednesday, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> admitted lying on Jan. 7, 1987, to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators about sharing a marijuana cigarette with <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>. The statement also said <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> lied about having tested cab signals to ensure they were in working order and lied about observing and calling out signals along the route, including a signal telling the train to slow down and stop, after he smoked the marijuana cigarette. Gates' public defender, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> that the federal government should n't have brought the charges. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the government waited until <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> pleaded guilty to the state charges, including an extensive statement of facts, before filing its indictment. `` It amounts to kicking the dog when he's down,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` He literally gave a written confession to what would be federal charges.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` In my judgment, the federal prosecution smacks of both grandstanding ... and pandering to the public.'' <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> said after the hearing he would respond to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s accusations at sentencing, but added, `` I wonder who's doing the grandstanding. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> was indicted by a federal grand jury March 31, two days after being sentenced and fined $ 1,000 in <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on the state charge.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> assailed <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> on Wednesday for continuing to allege that American diplomats are meddling in its domestic politics. `` In spite of our denials, the government of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> continues to allege that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats engaged in activities not in keeping with accepted international practice and interfered in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s domestic affairs,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not, and has not been, engaged in interference in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s domestic affairs. All activities of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials in dealing with <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> have been legitimate and in full accordance with customary diplomatic practice,'' he added.

The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends that its diplomats meet routinely with members of the constitutional opposition in other countries to keep abreast of political developments. Earlier this month, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remove one of its embassy officers, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retaliated by asking for the ouster of a Singaporan diplomat stationed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Office Building Guard Charged in Rape of Attorney</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An attorney working late in her office was kidnapped and raped repeatedly by a security guard while police declined to investigate her disappearance, authorities said. The suspect was arrested by fellow guards shortly after he released the woman. <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, 24, a part-time guard for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, was charged in <LOCATION> Ramsey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> on Tuesday with two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct stemming from the incident, which began Sunday evening. The victim suffered numerous cuts and bruises during the 13-hour ordeal, police said. For a time, she was locked in a car trunk, blindfolded and gagged with duct tape, while the guard completed his shift at the downtown office building. Guards from American Security began searching for West early Monday after <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> police classified the situation a missing-person case and declined to launch an immediate investigation, the security company chairman said. Police officials expressed concern about the incident and said they will be discussing it with the staff members who handled it. They also said they are investigating possible kidnapping charges against <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> Deputy Police Chief Deputy <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Laux </PERSON>, who is handling the case, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking further comment Wednesday. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, chairman of American Security, said Tuesday that he assigned seven investigators to the case at 3 a.m. Monday after the victim's husband reported her missing. The husband and a guard found blood on a carpet outside the woman's office and another guard remembered seeing blood on the hand of a man he relieved. West's arrest at about 10:30 a.m. Monday followed a five-hour stakeout of his apartment by some of the investigators, May said. `` We were on our own, so we could n't do much more than that,'' May said. `` We decided a crime had been committed, but the police wanted to pursue it as a missing person.'' Police said the victim went to her office around 6 p.m. Sunday to catch up on work and was let into the building by a guard. Shortly after 9 p.m., the guard walked into the office and told her she would have to leave because of a fire alarm. In the hallway, he grabbed her by the neck and then punched her in the mouth when she screamed. He threatened to kill her and used duct tape to blindfold and gag her and tie her hands behind her back. He then took her to his car and forced her into the trunk. The guard left her there while he completed his shift, then drove to an apartment where he raped her at least five times. Around 10 a.m. Monday, the assailant agreed to release her. They left the apartment and the victim was dropped off outside a motel about five blocks away. West was arrested outside the apartment minutes later by two American Security investigators.

 Iraqi forces drove the Iranians from the marshes east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> on Wednesday, dealing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> its third major military defeat in recent weeks. An Iraqi statement said the Iranians were pushed across the border after 10 hours of fighting in an offensive called `` On God We Depend.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also said its warplanes made a long-range bombing raid on an important power plant near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s border with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initially claimed to have repelled the Iraqi assault in the <LOCATION> Salamchah </LOCATION> region, which its Revolutionary Guards seized at great cost in January and February of last year. Several hours later, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announced: `` Following heavy clashes ... the Moslem forces of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had to retreat from parts of the area they had captured before. The Moslem forces are responding to heavy artillery fire.'' It said Iranian planes `` heavily bombed'' <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troop concentrations, inflicting `` substantial losses in men and equipment.'' An Iraqi communique distributed by the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said five Iranian divisions were `` wiped out'' and survivors retreated across the frontier. It did not give figures, but an Iranian division usually averages about 10,000 men. There was no way to confirm the Iraqi casualty claim. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military analysts estimate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> lost at least 25,000 soldiers in last year's battle for <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and about 10,000 Iraqis were killed. Conflicting reports seldom can be verified because neutral observers have been allowed into battle zones only rarely since the war began in September 1980. Loss of the bridgehead near <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> would extend a string of Iranian defeats that began when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, led by elite Presidential Guards, pushed the Iranians off the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> on April 16-18. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had held the marshy finger of land for two years. Also on April 18, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyed two of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s offshore oil Platforms in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and sank or disabled six Iranian naval craft in related confrontations. Those defeats, combined with economic problems and political uncertainty within <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, appear to have put <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime on the defensive after a long period of initiative in the ground war. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> 3rd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, again led by Presidential Guards, moved before dawn to recapture the marshes around <LOCATION> Fish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> created the artificial lake early in the war as a barrier to Iranian invasion, but Revolutionary Guards fought through several <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> defense lines last year to take the wetlands. A communique from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its soldiers pushed across the <PERSON> Jassim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duaiji </PERSON> rivers around <LOCATION> Fish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> on Wednesday and `` the Iranian invaders have been defeated and driven outside our international borders.'' President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> `` personally supervised the offensive,'' traveling to the battlefield with his defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khairallah </PERSON>, the communique said. It did not elaborate. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> radio interrupted regular programs to announce `` a great victory'' in an `` epic battle.'' <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers in the capital fired automatic weapons into the air to celebrate. Another Iranian report said its army repelled an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> counterattack in the mountainous <LOCATION> Sulaimaniyeh </LOCATION> region of northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> seized territory several weeks ago. It reported `` heavy losses and casualties'' among the Iraqis. Until the <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> offensive, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had fought a static war since 1982 behind defense lines of heavy artillery, tanks, rocket launchers and minefields. Their main offensive operation was a bombing campaign against economic targets and Iranian cities. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Khairallah </PERSON> told army commanders to be `` fully ready'' for new offensives `` if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> insists on flouting'' a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution passed July 20. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said it will abide by the resolution if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> does, but the Iranians say there can be no truce until <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is designated the aggressor. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after border skirmishes. The defense minister said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would seek to regain territory seized by the Iranians. The Iranians still hold part of the Majnoon marshes north of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory in the mountainous <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> region of the north. Dispatches from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes flew more than 600 miles to bomb the <LOCATION> Neka </LOCATION> power station on the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, 125 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, `` turning it into ashes.'' The Iraqi air force also bombed the plant several months ago. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said bombs struck the homes of workers near the power station but it gave no details. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said other Iraqi jets raided <LOCATION> Sardasht </LOCATION>, a northwestern border town, killing 29 civilians. An <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military spokesman said no raids were conducted in the <LOCATION> Sardasht </LOCATION> region. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was trying `` to justify Iranian bombing of Iraqi residential areas and to cover up its defeats.. on the battlefield.''

<HEAD>Light Bush Vote Encourages Idaho Democrats</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The relatively light vote behind <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s easy victory in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s presidential primary raised <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> hopes that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could claim the state's four electoral votes in November. However, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders pointed out that <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> has landed in the Republican column every presidential election since <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s 1964 national landslide. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> captured 82 percent of the vote in a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary that was barely contested. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who pulled out of the campaign earlier this month, split the other 18 percent with an uncommitted bloc. The result was the vice president adding 15 of the 18 nominating delegates at stake to his total that already exceeds the number needed for the nomination. Unofficial returns from Tuesday's balloting showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who campaigned in the state during two days three weeks ago, receiving nearly 56,000 of the less than 68,000 Republican votes cast. Four years ago, by comparison, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got 97,000 of 106,000 votes. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can not and never has been able to generate enthusiasm and strength as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has, and a lot of people did n't care enough about him to go to the polls,'' Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I think that shows the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> candidacy will do much better than any other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate has for years in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>, who endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> three weeks ago. The Democratic primary was only a popularity contest with no delegates at stake. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, won it easily with 73 percent of the vote. That overwhelmed the support he garnered seven weeks earlier in the county caucuses where he captured eight convention delegates while six went uncommitted and four backed <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Turnout on the Democratic side was about 51,000. That was down 3,500 from the primary four years ago when <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of neighboring <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> was trying to wrest the Democratic nomination from <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. Republicans on Wednesday were saying little about the primary results, though some contended the low turnout was due to a lack of contested state races. `` There just was n't a big incentive for Republicans to get out and vote,'' Republican Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> said of the all-but-certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, `` If he brings out who the individual <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is he will win. By fall the vice president will be able to carry a large vote.''

<HEAD>Hearing Opens on Recruit's Swimming Pool Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hearing on whether six sailors should face court-martial in the death of a recruit who drowned during training in a swimming pool opened Wednesday with the investigating officer ruling to keep the proceedings open. Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died March 2 while receiving air-sea rescue training at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. Five swimming instructors are accused of dragging <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> into the pool and holding his head under water while struggling with him until he collapsed and later died. The sixth man charged is their commanding officer. A cause of death is not mentioned in the charges against the six. Military lawyers for two of the instructors argued Wednesday that the hearing should be closed because extensive press coverage may prejudice a future court-martial panel. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON>, the goverment's lawyer, argued to keep the hearing open. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. D'Alesio, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the investigating officer, agreed, saying such hearings are traditionally and presumptively open and public access promotes fairness and confidence in the military legal system. However, he reserved the right to close portions of the hearing. `` I think the law is clear: If there is any closure it is to be done with a scalpel, not an ax,'' <PERSON> D'Alesio </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s sister, and her husband, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, attended the Wednesday session. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials have denied charges by the Johansens that they were slow to investigate <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death Charges were filed May 10 after two months of investigating. The <PERSON> Johansens </PERSON> said during the investigation that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> refused to confirm or deny accusations by <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s classmates that the recruit was roughly treated by instructors just before his death. The <PERSON> Johansens </PERSON> said the students told them they were ordered to turn their backs to the pool while the instructors kept <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> in the water and sing `` The Star Spangled Banner'' to drown out his screams. `` I think what pushed us all along is that we lost our <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and that's what we're looking for _ not for revenge or anything _ but we still are driven by wanting to know the true facts,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> said late Tuesday. Other action Wednesday was limited to lawyers' objections to various statements collected by investigators. Another procedural hearing is scheduled Friday beause two defense lawyers were unable to be present Wednesday. D'Alesio, of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said the hearing then will recess until June 4, when the first witnesses are to testify. Petty Officers 1st Class <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON>, Petty Officers 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelenock </PERSON> are charged with involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery. Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, officer in charge of the school, is charged with dereliction of duty. Rear Adm. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, chief of naval air training, headquartered in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, ordered the hearing, known as an Article 32 investigation, or the military's equivalent of a grand jury inquiry. D'Alesio will recommend whether the charges against the sailors should go to court-martial, be dismissed or handled through non-judicial means. His recommendation is not binding; <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> makes a final decision. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> first told the Johansens that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death was accidental and attributed it to natural causes, something that a spokesman for <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> says was an error resulting from a misunderstanding by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> legal officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. If found guilty at a court-martial, the accused instructors could be dishonorably discharged and <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> could be dismissed, the equivalent of a dishonorable discharge for officers. The instructors also face up to three years in prison on the involuntary manslaughter charge and six months for the conspiracy count. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> could get a maximum of three months. The Swimmer School has been closed since <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> rescue experts began meeting Monday to considered changes in the school's curriculum and procedures. Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, chief of naval education and training, has said the school may reopen June 15.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are considering a high-level meeting to discuss the resettlement of Vietnamese who worked with Americans during the war and have been freed from prison camps there, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Vietnamese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatch </PERSON> sent a May 23 message through the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, asking for a meeting with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential envoy retired Army Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> held talks with Vietnamese officials in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> last year on stepping up efforts to find some 2,500 Americans missing in action from the Indochinese war. Contacts with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which does not have diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have been sporadic in recent years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has adopted a policy of isolating <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> economically and diplomatically in order to pressure the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> government into ending its 10-year military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> sent a letter last month to Thatch welcoming <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s release of hundreds of prisoners from so-called re-education camps in September 1987 and February 1988, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s letter also expressed `` our concern about the fate of these prisoners because of their association with us and the former <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The former Vietnamese officials and loyalists were placed in prison camps after Communist North <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> defeated U.S.-backed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1975. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> asked Thatch to discuss resettlement of the released prisoners in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a move which `` reflects our continuing concern for the welfare of our former allies,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> added. Slightly more than 1,000 political prisoners were freed in February 1988, and Vietnamese officials have assured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that fewer than 150 people remain in re-education camps, said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. The official, who asked not to be named, said some 900,000 Vietnamese had undergone short-term or long-term `` re-education'' since 1975. He said only a handful of those who were released from the camps have come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pentagon Report Says Job Cuts Possible Without Harming Readiness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An internal study ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> concludes the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> could eliminate 7,300 jobs from its headquarters around the world, or 12 percent of the total, without jeopardizing military readiness. Such cuts would save more than $ 300 million a year in operating cost and eliminate duplication that in some cases almost guarantees <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s military forces will have a hard time fighting any war, the study asserts. The situation has gotten so out of hand the Pentagon does n't even properly count its headquarters' staff, it added `` We have a situation where the department is reporting about 33,132 positions in Unified and Specified Commands and supporting service component commands in budget justifications provided <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, while we identified 59,510 positions in these same headquarters during the review,'' it said. `` The review disclosed significant areas of overlapping responsibilities, duplication of functions, layering and opportunities for saving manpower.'' The study, requested by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> last Dec. 14, was performed by a 22-member panel chaired by <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaaf </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy inspector general. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> obtained a copy Wednesday. The inch-thick report has been closely held since its completion in February, on the ground that <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is still awaiting a review of the findings by Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. That review is not expected to be completed before next month at the earliest, but the study itself was provided to key congressional leaders on Tuesday. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaaf </PERSON>, whose office serves as an internal watchdog, to review the organization of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> and the major military commands after the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reached a deficit-reduction agreement cutting defense spending. At the time, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he hoped to reduce overhead costs. `` Although probably no one will agree with all of the recommendations contained in this report, I believe that substantial savings can be made without jeopardizing military readiness ...,'' <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaaf </PERSON> wrote. `` In many cases, output will actually increase when layering and staff sizes are reduced. I recommend the elimination of 7,309 military and civilian positions by the end of fiscal 1989.'' The study panel spotlighted what it called overlapping or superfluous headquarters units that amounted to military bureaucracy run amok:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Forces Caribbean Command in <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was established `` as a response to reports of a Soviet brigade in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' `` But in all the important contingencies imaginable, it appears the command will either get in the way or be ignored. -LRB- The command -RRB- is clearly not essential to either our peacetime or wartime needs.'' _ The division of responsibility for air and ground defenses in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> `` is confusing -LRB- and -RRB- will probably not work in an emergency ...'' It said the situation has been complicated by the need to obtain the political blessing of Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, a top member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defense appropriations subcommittee _ The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has a separate Western Command in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, designated as its representative to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> The Pentagon `` simply can not afford the luxury of having 527 personnel in a command to serve as the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> trainer for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and as an ` adviser' to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> on Army matters.'' _ The <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> maintains a system of Air Division headquarters within the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that is `` largely superfluous'' and can only be categorized as `` nice to have, but unnecessary. The panel took special aim at the Space Command, the Special Operations Command and the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, saying it could see no reason for each of the military services to have headquarters units representing them within those commands. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> does not really need a separate <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sealift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> underneath it, the study said. If those units were disbanded, `` the estimated savings in headquarters manpower over the next two years would be 1,015 positions.'' An additional 286 positions could be slashed from the staff of the Joint Chiefs, which now numbers 2,005, the study added.

 Three incumbent Democratic congressmen easily won primary contests in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s two incumbent congressmen prepared to face challengers selected in that state's primary.

<HEAD>Lottery Bill: You Can't Take it With You, So Get it Up Front</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH EDWARDSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Because you ca n't take it with you, the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill Wednesday that would allow lottery winners over 65 to receive their winnings sooner than younger people who hit the jackpot. Older lottery winners could take the current value of their lottery prize in one lump sum or in periodic payments over their expected lifetime. `` The usual 20-year payoff on a lottery prize will not always result in a total benefit to the winner who is over 65, as he may not live to receive the full benefit,'' said a memo on the bill. `` The fact that the unpaid balance would be paid to his estate is of little consolation to many elderly winners who may wish to fully enjoy the fruits of their good fortune,'' the memo said. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, director of the Lottery Division, said he opposes the bill because it would substantially reduce jackpots. The jackpot up Wednesday was $ 3 million. `` I do n't have $ 3 million to give them, I have $ 1.4 million,'' he said. `` The difference is interest money.'' Under the current plan, a winner would receive 21 annual payments of $ 114,000 after taxes, said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. If someone opted to take the prize in a $ 1.4 million lump sum, they would owe about $ 580,000 in taxes, he said. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said he did n't believe any state lotteries now offer the lump-sum option. The average million-dollar lottery winner is 49 years old, said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said he had not informed the state Legislature of his opposition to the bill, now before the <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>House Votes to Lift Curb on Interstate Ads for Gambling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday to remove a federal prohibition on interstate advertising of gambling. Under current law, advertising of games of chance are prohibited in interstate commerce except for state-conducted lotteries between adjacent states that also have lotteries. The bill, approved by voice vote and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would allow advertising across state lines of gambling activities, such as casino gambling and church raffles and bingo, conducted by public or private groups so long as they are legal in the state where they are held. The legislation would still allow individual states to restrict such advertising.

<HEAD>Commercial Banks Recovering From Worst Year Since Depression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's commercial banks appear to be recovering from their worst year since the Depression despite mounting bank failures in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and continuing problems with loans to Third World countries, federal regulators said Wednesday. `` The banking system as a whole is sound and getting sounder ... The outlook for the immediate future is cautiously optimistic,'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The performance of farm banks, the sore spot of the industry several years ago, is slowly improving as agriculture recovers from its slump, he said. The nation's largest banks, bedeviled by shaky loans to less developed countries, wrote off big losses last year and now have `` adequate, if not comfortable, reserves,'' he said. And there are signs that the economy of the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, heavily dependent on the oil industry, has hit bottom and turned up. Still, he warned, bank failures in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> could rise from 50 last year to 70 this year because banks' performance generally lags economic changes. `` We believe 1989 looks better -LRB- in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- for two reasons: Every major bank will have its problems resolved in one way or another. ... And smaller banks are already showing some recovery in the first quarter'' of 1988, he said. Last year, by almost any measure, was the worst for the nation's 13,650 commercial banks since 1933 A record 184 banks failed _ <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> expects about the same number this year _ and banking as a whole posted its lowest profit level in 54 years, a 2.02 percent return on equity. But, the entire drop can be attributed to the $ 20.6 billion in write-offs for overseas loans, a move the regulators said has strengthened banks' ability to deal with the problem. `` There are two areas of concern,'' said the comptroller of the currency, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, whose office regulates nationally chartered banks. `` But they should not overshadow the fact that the national banking system remains sound.'' Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., agreed that `` the picture this year is by no means gloomy,'' but he raised concerns about the possibility that developing country loans will have to be written down still further Banks have written off the loans by about 25 percent to 30 percent, but they trade on the open market at only about 50 cents on the dollar, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said `` meaningful progress'' has been achieved on the Third World debt problem. Because much of the value of the loans depends on the countries' willingness, rather than their ability, to pay, judgments vary as to how much they should be written down. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, the chairman of the committee, also questioned the ability of banks to withstand a severe recession. `` What haunts me is that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> today might be the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tomorrow if we have a national recession,'' he said. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, whose agency insures bank deposits up to $ 100,000, said many banks are prepared to withstand a short recession with few ill effects. He added, `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> fund is adequate to deal with any problems we can foresee in the banking system in 1988.'' Compared with the fund that insures savings institutions, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> is in good shape, ending 1987 with $ 18.3 billion, up slightly from the end of 1986. But, the fund could record its first loss, depending on how much it costs to restore <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicbank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to health. At least one thrift industry trade group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, is eyeing the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> as a potential source of money to rescue the S & amp; L insurance fund, which most analysts say will not have enough money to meet the $ 20 billion to $ 60 billion pricetag of cleaning up insolvent savings institutions. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> vigorously opposed that idea, arguing that the money should come from the thrift industry and as a last resort, the taxpayer.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> distributed $ 1.7 million in federal matching funds to presidential candidates Wednesday, bringing to $ 56.2 million the total the government has given out in the primary campaign this year. Four candidates were certified for money on Wednesday: Republican Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, $ 289,792; Democrats <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, $ 369,442, and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, $ 967,942, and independent <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON>, $ 42,289. The candidate who has received the most matching funds overall, Republican <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, has suspended his campaign and received no money on Wednesday.

To be eligible for matching funds, a candidate must raise an initial $ 100,000 across 20 states in contributions of $ 250 or less. Thereafter the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> matches each contribution of $ 250 that candidates raise privately. The matching fund is supported by the voluntary $ 1 checkoff on individual income tax returns.

<HEAD>Acreage Idling Requirement to be Cut in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat farmers will be required to idle only 10 percent of their base acreage for the 1989 harvest, compared with 27.5 percent for 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday. Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> also said the government's price support loan rate for 1989 will be reduced to $ 2.06 per bushel from $ 2.21 this year. The 1989 target price will be $ 4.10 per bushel, down from $ 4.23 for the 1988 wheat crop. Farmers who wish to qualify for price supports and other program benefits are required to go along with acreage set-aside, or idling, requirements. The loan rate is how much a farmer can borrow from the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> by using the crop as collateral. If market prices are significantly higher later on, the producer usually repays the loan and sells or uses the commodity at will. If market prices are lower than the loan rate, the producer has the option of forefeiting the grain to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, thereby canceling the debt. Target prices are used to compute federal direct payments to producers. When market prices are below the target, `` deficiency'' payments are made to make up the difference between the basic loan rate or the average market price, whichever his higher. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the reduction in the loan rate was necessary to maintain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat's competitiveness in domestic and international markets. The reduction in the set-aside for 1989 reflects a draw-down in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpiles and a decision to rebuild those inventories in order to meet future export demand.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a permit on Wednesday for a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> firm to conduct field tests of a genetically engineered pesticide that does n't alter the genetics of the pest or the plant being protected. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, a spokeswoman, said she was told that the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> signed the permit for the <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, aimed at protecting corn from the European corn borer through a process akin to inoculation. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> gave its approval on Tuesday for the test. Crop Genetics plans to take a harmless bacterium found in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> grass and use it to carry a gene from another bacterium, called Cxc-Bt, that will then produce a toxin lethal to corn borers. The toxin would only be activated inside the alkaline stomach of the borer, a kind of caterpillar, after it eats the treated plant tissue. The acid stomachs of humans, birds, animals and fish simply digest the protein. Cxc-Bt `` will have limited persistence in the environment and is not likely to be harmful to humans or other non-target organisms,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. The effect on other organisms is not of concern, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said, because the parent Cxc strain is native to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, the toxin-producing gene will be naturally eliminated from the Cxc and stringent containment procedures will be followed. The firm plans to inoculate 6,300 corn plants on 1.37 acres at its research farm at <LOCATION> Ingleside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and 3,500 plants on 0.78 acre at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION> just outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Journalists Win Battle To Get Edwin Wilson Deposition In Contra
Lawsuit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent will be allowed to testify in a $ 24 million civil suit that accuses former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials, Contra leaders and cocaine traffickers of running a guns-for-drugs smuggling scheme. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> agreed Wednesday to take a formal deposition from <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> in the civil suit filed by two journalists. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is in prison on convictions for selling explosives and plotting to kill the federal prosecutor in his case. According to the plaintiffs' lawyer, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> has testified that one of the defendants, former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> deputy director of operations <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, helped set up a secret, illegal intelligence operation. The lawsuit, filed by journalists <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Honey </PERSON>, maintains that <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, Iran-Contra figures <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and others, set up the operation to assassinate terrorists and enemies of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies, and ship weapons to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. `` <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> shows this is the off-the-shelf operation set up by <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, just as we have been saying,'' said <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. The suit stems from a 1984 bombing of a news conference held by maverick Contra commander <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Three journalists and five <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> supporters died in the explosion, although <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> was only slightly injured. <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> was seriously hurt and his camera damaged in the explosion. Under federal law, he and his wife, Ms. <PERSON> Honey </PERSON>, have the right to file suit for damages. Wednesday's hearing was held to consider a motion by <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in 1979, to drop him as a defendant in the lawsuit. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said he would not rule immediately. <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, argued that, two years after filing suit, the plaintiffs have yet to come up with any credible evidence connecting <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON> to any conspiracy that led to the bombing. But <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> countered with a sworn statement by <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, saying that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and others had met in 1976 and 1977 to set up the private intelligence operation to prevent it from being ended by the incoming <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. The lawsuit contends the Contra gun-running operation was simply one of the latest in a series of activities by the secret team, including the assassinations of enemies of the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and military aid to <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, both before and after his 1979 overthrow by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. After the hearing, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> hailed King's decision to allow <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s deposition to be taken as a victory for the plaintiffs. They have argued that events of a decade ago _ when they claimed the operation was set up _ should be examined in the case. Prior to Wednesday's decision, <PERSON> King </PERSON> had only allowed depositions covering back to 1983. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said the decision was not a setback, but added, `` It is going to complicate the case.'' Both sides agree the June 27 trial date will be more difficult to meet. Besides <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, other defendants in the suit include <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> leaders <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>; and retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>. The suit was filed in May 1986, six months before the Iran-Contra affair became public, and many of the names it brought to light have been indicted or appeared before congressional committees investigating that case. All the major figures in the suit have strenuously denied the charges in the case. In a May 6 hearing in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> accused members of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of attempting to block the suit because of potential damage to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who led the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in 1976.

<HEAD>Estate Of Young `Poltergeist' Actress Files Wrongful Death Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A wrongful death suit was filed Wednesday against a hospital and an insurance group by the estate of <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, the actress sucked into a swirling supernatural vacuum in the `` Poltergeist'' movies. <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> died Feb. 1 on the operating table at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> She was 12. She died of septic shock due to congenital stenosis of the intestine, a bowel blockage the girl evidently had from birth, hospital officials said at the time. The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanente </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> <PERSON> Peel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s mother and administrator of her estate, does not specify damages. `` We want to be free to establish damages,'' said <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gage </PERSON>, the <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> family's attorney. Children's Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON> said she could not comment on the suit. <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> <PERSON> Permanente </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> said: `` About all we can say is that we have reviewed the case extensively and we are convinced that the care we provided was appropriate. But we ca n't discuss the specifics any further. The lawsuit contends the hospital's diagnosis led to <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s death `` The doctors failed to recognize that she had a bowel obstruction since birth and misdiagnosed her condition. As a result, they prescribed medication instead of a relatively simple operation that would have cured her,'' <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> said. In addition to her `` Poltergeist'' roles, <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> was a regular on television's `` Happy Days,'' a recurring character on `` Webster'' and `` Still the Beaver'' and one of the stars in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries on teen-age suicide called `` Surviving.''

 The chief opponent of the medium-range arms control treaty conceded defeat Wednesday, clearing the way for possible <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of the historic accord before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> meets Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this weekend. `` I'm fairly confident we will be able to finish the treaty Friday or Saturday,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, That would mean the treaty could be approved in time to fly the ratification notice to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> so the president could present it to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during the May 29-June 2 summit, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> noted. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday for the summit, with a three-day stopover in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, en route. Ratification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact requires 67 votes and is assured because 90 or more senators support the treaty, according to supporters and critics of the pact. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, the treaty's chief critic, conceded he had failed in his attempt to modify the accord, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed Dec. 8 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I'm licked in terms of doing anything on the treaty,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> told reporters. Later, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> admitted, `` I've had no illusions from the very beginning about the prospects of defeating this treaty.'' The treaty requires elimination within three years of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. It would result in the elimination of 867 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elimination of 1,752 Soviet missiles. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders met behind closed doors to work out an agreement that would end the procedural snarl which has blocked definitive action on the pact since it reached the floor last week. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and other critics, using <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules designed to protect the rights of the minority, have stalled action, filing a series of amendments that were rejected overwhelmingly. In response, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., filed a cloture motion to halt debate That motion is set for a vote Thursday. Approval of the motion requires 60 votes and is assured, meaning the debate would be limited to 30 hours. That would set up a final vote Friday. The back-stage talks were aimed at setting aside the cloture vote, which also would mean the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could avoid the all-night session which would be required if cloture were invoked. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said that after the cloture motion was filed, he realized `` the ball game was over.'' But he said he still was seeking approval of some amendments which could be attached as conditions to the resolution of ratification. But there was no agreement by late Wednesday afternoon, meaning the cloture vote was likely to go ahead Thursday morning. Meantime, the chamber voted 89-9 to reject a Helms amendment which would have abrogated the treaty if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> found that the Soviets had furnished false information. It was the 10th time the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had voted overwhelming rejection of amendments offered by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> conservatives. `` The Soviets have cheated -LRB- on other treaties -RRB-, they are cheating now, and they will continue to cheat,'' said <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. But Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., said the proposal would be a `` killer amendment'' that would require the pact to be renegotiated with the Soviets <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the Reagan-Gorbachev meeting, `` as do all summits, offers the promise of progress ... and the peril of inflated expectations.'' He urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to `` do our part'' and approve the INF pact, which he noted is `` the first ever to reduce existing nuclear stockpiles and eliminate whole classes of nuclear weapons.'' One unresolved issue in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was the fate of a Democratic-backed proposal which would require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval before any future president could change how the treaty is interpreted. That amendment, added by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, arises from a long-running fight over a separate issue involving the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asserts that the White House can unilaterally change the interpretation of a treaty, a view disputed by congressional Democrats. Many Senate Republicans oppose that amendment, Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., noted Wednesday `` This issue of treaty interpretation is one that will have far-reaching consequences,'' <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> told his colleagues. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said Democrats still have n't decided the specific language of that amendment.

<HEAD>NYSE Chief Ties Investor Uncertainty to Future Doubts, Not October
Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that continuing market skittishness is due to uncertainty over the future of the economy, not to lingering aftershocks of the October market crash. `` I think the markets are really looking toward the future ... and can not make up their minds about it,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. `` I think when they make up their minds, confidence will return.'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, in a luncheon speech to Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future, acknowledged that small investors have pulled out of the market since the plunge of last October, but said, `` I think they are behaving very prudently now, which is, in times of uncertainty, do nothing.'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said his own view of the economy's prospects was somewhere between that of the pessismists who have predicted a 1930s style depression and optimists who assert the economy is headed for a `` rolling correction,'' entailing little more than somewhat higher interest rates and slower growth. `` Unless you believe in the tooth fairy, you do n't believe the business cycle has gone away,'' he said. `` There are the beginnings of certain classic signs of the end of an economic expansion. ... Unless something is very strange, the next 18 months to two years are not going to be easy.'' But looking toward the 1990s and beyond, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said the future looks bright. `` I'm 57 years old and the bears have always lost,'' he said. The clearinghouse is a bipartisan caucus of senators and representatives concerned with long-range trends and issues of the future.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> congressman introduced legislation Wednesday he said would speed congressional efforts to protect the <ORGANIZATION> Manassas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battlefield </ORGANIZATION> from encroaching commercial development. The bill by Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., calls for immediate government acquisition of the approximately 600 acres adjacent to the park where a developer plans to build a shopping mall It also directs the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary to make sure the scenery around the park is protected, calls for closing two roads that bisect the Civil War site and proposes a bypass to carry traffic around the area. A bill already has been introduced for government purchase of the land now owned by <ORGANIZATION> Hazel-Peterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> developers, but it directs acquisition through the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, a slower process than the `` legislative taking'' of the land recommended by <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. The earlier legislation was introduced by Reps. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and by Wednesday had 166 co-sponsors. Tad <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>'s press secretary, said the congressman `` is wholeheartedly endorsing the -LRB- Wolf -RRB- bill.'' `` He hopes that it can be melded together with his bill, but it accomplishes everything he hopes to see done,'' <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said. `` I think everyone should be pleased that a Virginian has finally said no to the shopping mall,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> congressman whose district is near the battlefield just outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he will co-sponsor <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s bill. Rep. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaughter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whose district includes the park, is studying the bill, according to his administrative assistant, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Spatz </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION>, which also has been fighting the developer, said his organization was encouraged to have <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s support. `` We want to study it further, but it looks like something we could support,'' said <PERSON> Spatz </PERSON>. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s plan -RRB- provides more certainty that the property owner would get paid for the property.'' Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> had proposed that the developer move the shopping mall so it would not be visible from the park. He also said the roads bisecting the park should be closed. Though preservationists like the idea of closing the roads, they say the mall should not be anywhere near the park because of traffic problems it would create.

 A federal judge has directed the government to require that warnings about the health hazards of smokeless tobacco be printed on umbrellas, towels and other items used to promote the products. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ruled that the Smokeless Tobacco Act is `` clear and unequivocal'' in its requirement that all advertising for smokeless tobacco _ except billboards _ carry warnings the products may cause mouth cancer, gum disease or tooth loss. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to revise regulations that had also exempted promotional items such as T-shirts, promotional banners, coffee mugs and caps, from the requirement. The judge stayed his order, however, to give the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> an opportunity to appeal the decision. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ruled that the exemption given by the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to promotional items undercut the clear intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in passing the law. `` If vendors of smokeless tobacco products are able to put their wares before prospective consumers, bare of warning labels on T-shirts, hats, coffee mugs, beverage coolers, and the like, as a practical matter they may effectively frustrate the purpose of the warning label requirements by doing most of their advertising with ` utilitarian' giveaways,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in an opinion dated May 20 but made public Wednesday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made the ruling in a lawsuit brought last year by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leader of a political coalition allied with leftist guerrillas said Wednesday the government's refusal to resume negotiations on ending the 8-year-old war threatens a deeper crisis. `` This is a moment of life and death for the Salvadorans, for the national economy and the social structure,'' <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON> said. He arrived Wednesday on only his second visit to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since going into exile soon after the war began. Ungo, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said he would stay for about a week. He also returned for a week last November. His coalition is allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla alliance fighting the U.S.-supported government. He criticized the rejection Tuesday of a May 11 rebel proposal for renewed negotiations. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s government said it was not an opportune moment for talks In view of the nation's problems, Ungo declared, `` an opportune moment comes every day.'' A dispute over the results of March 20 elections left <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> without a legislature. The National Assembly has yet to be seated. Peace talks with the rebels broke down in October. The main purpose of Ungo's visit is to promote his political party, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, and a coalition called Democratic Convergence. <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>'s party formed the coalition last year with another member party of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the Social Democrats, an officially recognized leftist party. He said the Democratic Convergence might run a candidate in next year's presidential election. `` We do n't rule out participation,'' he said. `` We will see what role our growing presence and influence might play.'' The guerrillas and their allies have boycotted elections in the past.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> adopted an upbeat pre-summit tone Wednesday, quoting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying he was coming to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the interests of peace. The evening television news program Vremya carried a report from a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> correspondent on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit and later showed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaving for <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, en route to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s departure statement that he intended to work in the interests of peace during his visit to the Soviet capital next week. It quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying measures to reduce tension between the superpowers, capped by the signing of the agreement banning medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles at the last summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December, were `` only a beginning. The agency said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pledged to work for an agreement to cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range missiles during his meetings with <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It relegated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments on the deep differences that still divide the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the final paragraph of its dispatch. A pair of later articles distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> were more critical. One was a commentary by military analyst <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogachev </PERSON>. He said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had backtracked on a pledge at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit to observe the anti-ballistic missile treaty as signed in 1972, rather than using <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s broad interpretation that would allow more free development of the `` Star Wars'' program for a space-based nuclear defense. `` Is n't it time that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> began showing a more responsible attitude to its commitments?'' <PERSON> Bogachev </PERSON> asked. In a separate story, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a group of Soviet scientists appealed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for more flexibility in allowing Soviets to travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It cited the cases of several scientists who it said were denied visas. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> in another report as saying that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could exchange in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> instruments of ratification of the December agreement if the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratifies the treaty soon. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s arms control department, said Monday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should not ratify the treaty before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-W </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should be prepared to take final action on the treaty Friday or `` There are no doubts that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will not delay that historic act by taking too long to ratify the INF -LRB- intermediate nuclear forces -RRB- treaty,'' <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said. The treaty must be approved by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's top executive body.

 A 24-year-old computer wunderkind was in serious condition along with his mother Wednesday after what may have been a double suicide attempt following the seizure of his company, police said. <PERSON> Tex </PERSON> <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> fled the <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, area just before his 5-year-old computer services company, <ORGANIZATION> Massdata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was closed by authorities and its assets seized Tuesday. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> left behind about 30 angry employees and investors. He was arrested as a fugitive from justice in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> on Tuesday after an employee at the Holiday Inn called police to report a bloodied man wandering in the lobby. Police said that when they arrived just after 2 p.m., they found <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>, 50, lying injured in the hotel room the two shared. Police Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bovaird </PERSON> said both Hildreths were taken to <LOCATION> Elliot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where, according to hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, they were listed in serious condition Wednesday. <PERSON> Bovaird </PERSON> said both Hildreths were `` incoherent'' when police arrived at the hotel. He gave only sketchy details about their injuries but said it appeared that <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> may have slashed his wrists. He said a bottle of non-prescription pills were found in the hotel room along with what appeared to be suicide notes. <PERSON> Bovaird </PERSON> declined to elaborate, saying the case was still under investigation. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Rockland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owed more than $ 400,000, tried to seize the company's assets, but the office was closed at the time, according to senior vice president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. County authorities and state police secured the company offices Tuesday night. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that his office began to investigate <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> Tuesday after receiving complaints about him from several people who said they did business with him. <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION> police had charged <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> with larceny over $ 250 Tuesday after receiving a complaint from another person. <PERSON> McGorty </PERSON> said the investigation into <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>'s business dealings was expected to be `` lengthy.'' <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>'s sudden fall came after a meteoric rags to riches tale. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> was an overweight, unhappy teen-ager who transformed himself into a computer whiz and budding millionaire just a few years out of high school. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON>'s company turned profitable in 1987 and expected sales of about $ 4 million this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported in April. As recently as last month, <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> was profiled in an article that began with a description of him stepping out of a limousine with a beautiful woman to attend the fifth reunion of his <ORGANIZATION> Braintree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> class in November. `` This was my revenge for four years of hell,'' <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> said at the time. After buying his first computer at age 16, <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> began writing software programs. The confidence he gained as a computer whiz prompted him to lose 115 pounds in less than two years. With the help of a mentor in the <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> rented office space at the age of 20 and went into business as a computer consultant. He gradually built up the business, hiring young computer experts from other companies. He began to rapidly acquire the signs of success: a $ 220,000 <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION> condominium, a $ 32,000 BMW and a 50-inch, $ 4,000 color TV. His mother, who once worked as a lunch matron at her son's school, was made clerk of the company. Last week, employees became suspicious when the president of <PERSON> Massdata </PERSON> told them their paychecks were being withheld because <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> had not signed them. <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> had collapsed in his office two days earlier, suffering from what was described as an aneurysm, a dangerous weakening of a blood vessel.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday that a `` liberal elite'' is jeopardizing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security by opposing every new weapons system that would preserve a strong defense. He also expressed optimism that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be induced to step aside, despite Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' announcement that negotiations aimed at achieving that had failed, and no new talks were set. `` I'm convinced <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will be out of power,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. Speaking at a commencement ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, the vice president said of unnamed liberals, `` They are so blinded by ideology that they can not see what Americans have understood for 40 years: that peace flows from strength.'' The Republican presidential nominee-to-be did not say who he was referring to, apparently in deference to a federal ban on political activity on military installations. But it was clear he was talking about Democrats <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I'm sure they'd claim it is n't so and they're all in favor of a strong defense,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` They look the part, sober and measured in their gray suits, moving their hands on the Sunday talk shows with just the right amount of gravity and earnestness.'' `` But what are we to think, when they say they're for a strong defense but they oppose every new weapons system that would preserve that strength?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked. Asked about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, `` The fact that we have n't solved this does n't depress me.'' `` I do n't want a bad deal. I want a good deal,'' he said. `` We'll have to go back and figure it out.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides said last week that the vice president had urged that talks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> be suspended. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said while he and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had some differences on the matter, they both had the same `` policy objective of getting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out.'' The vice president again denied that he had known of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged drug-dealing before the Panamanian leader was indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges He said he thought <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should be extradited to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to face the chargs, but acknowledged that would be `` difficult'' in light of the lack of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition treaty with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivered the speech under a small canopy on the field of the academy's football stadium in a driving rainstorm, then stayed to shake hands with each of the 939 graduating cadets and watched as they hurled their caps aloft. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who in the past has criticized both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by name for a lack of foreign policy experience, noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left Wednesday morning for the upcoming superpower summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Praising the `` five years of patient effort'' toward a nuclear arms limitation treaty, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the summit was no reason for complacency toward the Soviets. `` We must be confident that those who will lead our country understand what it means to stand up to a challenge and meet our commitments,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We must be confident that they will pursue negotiations with the Soviets realistically.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides had billed the speech as non-partisan. And the vice president did praise former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidents <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. They, along with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, were part of a bipartisan consensus on dealing firmly with the Soviets that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said lasted from the 1940s to the mid-1960s. `` There are some today who have abandoned those principles,'' he said. `` The liberal elite do not understand _ they never understood _ the common sense behind the consensus.'' Later, addressing a group of senior citizens at a retirement village in <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued on the same defense theme and said `` we've got to keep our eyes wide open'' while negotiating with the Soviets. `` I am not naive aboutt Soviet intentions. We are on the right track. We should not be afraid to talk. We should never talk from a position of weakness,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign, meanwhile, acknowledged that chief spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> was shifting to other duties. `` He's going to make a job switch,'' said campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> would be `` a more creative type guy and work specifically on the surrogate teams.'' No reason was given for the change, but <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> were known to be at odds. On Thursday, after campaigning in the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will fly to his oceanside vacation retreat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he will spend the next week in a series of strategy and issues sessions while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 Two jetliners carrying a total of 286 people were assigned the same altitude and missed colliding head-on by 300 feet over the ocean north of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> last Monday, officials disclosed Wednesday. According to the officials, the pilots of the southbound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> A-300 and the northbound <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 did not see each other until the planes were passing at better than 500 miles an hour. Neither pilot had time to take evasive action, spokesmen for the two airlines said. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> confirmed that both jetliners were assigned to 29,000 feet and were under the control of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> air traffic control center at the time of the incident. That section of airspace is beyond <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> radar, so separation is maintained by assigning specific altitudes. The incident `` is being investigated as a possible operational error'' by air traffic controllers, <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. He said he did not know whether the controllers involved have been removed from directing aircraft, normally the procedure after such an incident. The <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane was Flight 217 from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and on to <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and carried 131 passengers and 10 crewmembers. The northbound plane was American Flight 902 from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> with 138 passengers and seven crewmembers aboard. The section of airspace about 550 miles north of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in the so-called <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Triangle </LOCATION> is beyond <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> radar at both <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> and on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. Commercial jets operate under oceanic flight rules and are still under radio air traffic direction. They are assigned specific altitudes to maintain proper separation. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> pilot filed a near-collision report with the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. The American jet's pilots also filed a report, according to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> still was investigating who gave the planes their altitude assignments. A source who asked not to be identified by name said the incident occurred near where control of planes switches from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> center and the handoff may have resulted in an altitude mixup. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said he could not confirm that. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the two jetliners had about 300 feet horizontal separation as they passed. `` Both aircraft observed each other as they passed,'' he said. Investigators for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> flew to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> on Wednesday to interview the controllers involved, said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>. `` We are investigating the incident. We're looking into it,'' <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said. He said the investigators may later interview the pilots.

<HEAD>Philippine Senate Approves Anti-Nuclear Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Senators approved on second reading Wednesday a bill that bans nuclear weapons on <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> territory but allows port calls by nuclear-powered ships. <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mercado </LOCATION>, majority floor leader, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to pass the bill next week on third reading, a formality where the legislators register their votes. The bill prohibits manufacture or storage of nuclear weapons in the country, but was amended to allow nuclear-powered vessels to make port calls after they are inspected by Philippine authorities. The chief sponsor of the measure, Sen. <PERSON> Wigberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanada </PERSON>, is an anti-nuclear activisit and opposes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Most senators hailed passage of the bill and said it would give President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s administration a stronger hand in negotiating with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on the future of <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Subic Naval Base and four smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities here. Sen. <PERSON> Mamintal </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamano </PERSON>, who earlier expressed concern about the bill's implications, said, `` This is a backdoor way of repudiating the existing treaty between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the termination of the bases agreement. `` The Americans will be very uncomfortable with such a law, which will render the bases ineffective.'' Anti-nuclear activists have accused the Americans of using the bases as storage or transit points for nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have refused to say yes or no. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy also is to remain silent on whether a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessel is carrying nuclear weapons. On April 5, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Filipino negotiators started a three-month review of the 1947 agreement governing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases here. The agreement expires in 1991. <PERSON> Tanada </PERSON> said his bill `` will strengthen the position of our panel in their negotiations with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' A colleague, Sen. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON>, said it gives Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> `` a credible option'' on the bases issue. The president has said she would `` keep her options open'' until 1991. Sen. <PERSON> Aquilino </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON>, an opponent of the bases, said the bill `` will send a very strong signal to the world that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is an independent nation.''

 The collapse of the negotiations aimed at inducing Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down from power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was greeted with relief on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> from Republicans and Democrats alike Wednesday. `` I ca n't help but welcome this announcement,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go if we are to achieve our goals in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> But sending <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> off into retirement with a legal golden parachute ... would have been the wrong step at the wrong time.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced Wednesday that the negotiations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s representatives had failed and no further talks were planned `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would not carry through with the arrangements his representatives have negotiated,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told an impromptu news conference. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had sponsored a resolution overwhelmingly adopted last week that put the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on record in opposition to any deal that would have dropped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug-trafficking charges against the Panamanian leader. `` Not only were we going the extra mile to win <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, `` we may have been going too many extra miles Perhaps the signal the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was trying to send around this town, and around the world, was heeded.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., agreed `` I think we should make no deals that involve dropping drug charges. That sends the wrong message, particularly when we are trying to show more resolve against drugs.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said, `` We missed many opportunities to get him out. We should not have precluded the use of force. It's a surrender.'' `` The administration's negotiations were nothing but bluster and bluff,'' said <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, a sharp critic of dropping the drug-trafficking charges. `` It was wishful thinking on the administration's part.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said, `` Frankly, I do n't see the collapse of the proposed deal as a major problem for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> This administration has handled the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> situation so badly that it is an embarrassment to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was n't a good deal for us ... `` This administration negotiates with the darndest people _ Iranian terrorists and Panamanian drug dealers,'' said <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>. `` I think we should have an administration which does n't negotiate with people like that.'' `` I think we need a multilateral approach to this problem in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, at the news conference, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would work through other countries in the hemisphere in pursuit of its goal to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed optimism that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be persuaded to step down, telling reporters in <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>: `` I'm convinced <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will be out of power.'' `` The fact that we have n't solved this does n't depress me,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he pursued his campaign for the presidency. `` I do n't want a bad deal I want a good deal.

 The state government said Wednesday a gas and kerosene depot in a residential area has been closed and would be moved because of an explosion and fire that forced evacation of 100,000 people. Spokesman <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> said at least 100,000 residents had to flee Tuesday as leaping flames threatened to ignite tanks filled with gasoline. No one was seriously injured in the blast Tuesday at the depot owned by <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, the state oil monopoly. However, several firefighters suffered minor burns and <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> said he saw several car accidents caused by fleeing motorists. `` The depot is closed,'' <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> said. `` It was a state government decision that was supported by <ORGANIZATION> Petroleos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexicanos </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> said an unpopulated site on the southern outskirts of the city of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> had been selected for the new depot, but he could not say how long it would take before it is opened. Local newspapers and neighborhood organizations had been demanding for nearly two years that the depot be relocated because of danger of explosion, the daily <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Novedades </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. A <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> <PERSON> Coronado </PERSON>, declined comment on the depot closing, saying the company was preparing an official statement. The 39-foot-high kerosene tank exploded in a residential area Tuesday morning while two workers soldered a pipeline at its base. <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> said the cause of the explosion was being investigated. He estimated damages to be at least $ 800,000. More than 100 <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> workers and firefighters worked until 8:30 p.m. to put out the blaze, which melted the top third of the 1.1-million-gallon steel tank. The nearby gasoline tank, scorched by the blaze, was hosed with ice water throughout the day to keep the gasoline from reaching its flashpoint. <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state government sent 6,000 pounds of a firefighting solvent known as `` soft water'' to help battle the blaze. Residents were informed shortly after 8 p.m. that they could return to their homes. The Pemex supply depot, which employs about 150 workers, was built in 1952 in what then was open fields. Now it sits in the middle of heavily populated residential districts in this city of 700,000, 230 miles south of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. The depot, which supplies area gasoline station and other petroleum users, includes 14 tanks capable of holding 1.1 million gallons, in addition to several small tanks containing two grades of gasoline, diesel fuel and kerosene. Petroleum products for the area will now be supplied by a <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> depot in Ciudad Juarez across the border from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> and by other depots in <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Coahuila </LOCATION> states.

 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> loaded food and medical supplies destined for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> onto a truck Wednesday, urging a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward the region. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made an impassioned speech to some 300 people gathered in a parking lot off Fisherman's Wharf, including some veterans who sponsored the 3,000-mile `` Veterans Peace Convoy'' to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was in the state campaigning for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s June 7 primary, which <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is favored to win. `` The $ 10 billion spent chasing 3 million Sandinistas ... that money should have been spent chasing poverty, illiteracy and disease and building houses ... in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It was immoral and illegal and a misappropriation of funds.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 30-minute address focused on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but he also referred to the upcoming Reagan-Gorbachev summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, calling it a `` step in the right direction.'' `` The American-Soviet future is not one of more threats, more arms buildup, more insecurity in the name of security, weaponizing the heavens and threatening to destroy the whole planet,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also urged the crowd to `` keep hope alive.'' `` Twenty years ago this year, our dreams were lofty and our hopes were high. And then <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> was killed April 4th and then <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on June 5th,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Our hopes were dashed, our dreams were busted. We went through a crucifixion. `` But now 20 years later, we keep on dreaming. The stone has been rolled away. Without a crucifixion in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, there's now a resurrection. New hope, new life, new possibility. And we're winning every day. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, citing his candidacy as evidence of progress in civil rights, said `` If we can debate the direction of our nation at the highest levels, we're winning every day.''

 A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney convicted of arranging a bribe for his close friend, federal judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, refused to testify Wednesday before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel considering <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' impeachment. Accompanied by two lawyers, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Borders invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on criminal justice that he would `` refuse to answer any and all questions'' about the case. Borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a $ 150,000 bribe for <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from two <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> racketeers, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, in exchange for a promise of lenient sentences. One year later, a separate trial jury acquitted <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of conspiring with Borders to solicit a bribe from the Romano brothers. Borders was fined $ 35,000, served 33 months in a federal prison at <LOCATION> Allenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and was disbarred by the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. `` I believe that my legal debt to society expired on May 22, 1988, after my release from parole,'' Borders told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that is investigating impeachment charges by a judicial panel against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., who is presiding over the televised hearings, deferred what he called the subcommittee's `` very difficult'' decision whether to grant Borders immunity from prosecution to compel his Borders has remained silent about the alleged bribery conspiracy since he was indicted in late 1981. He refused to testify at both his and <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' trials, and never appeared before a special investigative panel of the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that was appointed shortly after <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted. The judicial panel, after a 3 -LCB- - year study, concluded there was `` clear and convincing evidence'' that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> not only had engaged in a bribery schee but tried to conceal his role by lying under oath and fabricating evidence at his trial <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> has insisted that he knew nothing of the bribery plot and accuses Borders of trading on his name in an attempt to shake down the <PERSON> Romanos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who is <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s first black federal judge, says the case against him is racially and politically motivated. After Borders was excused, <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> led the subcommittee in close and sometimes critical questioning of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doar </PERSON>, chief counsel to the five-judge appellate panel whose charges against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> prompted the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeachment proceedings. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said it was `` amazing'' that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested Borders after he had received $ 125,000 in bribery money from an undercover agent posing as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, but before Borders could have given the money to someone else. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was staying at a hotel five minutes away when Borders was arrested Oct. 9, 1981, inside a car with the undercover agent and a garment bag stuffed with $ 125,000 in cash. A few hours later, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> presumably would have met Borders at an evening boating party which he and other friends were giving in Borders' honor. But <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> flew home to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> shortly after he learned of Borders' arrest. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, in effect, broke up its own entrapment,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said. He said that seemed to suggest that `` they did n't believe there was anyone else involved'' in a bribery scheme. <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> said he understood that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` was not prepared to let the money get out of their control.'' In any event, he said, the judicial panel believed there was plenty of other evidence implicating <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> in a bribery scheme. `` They did not need the money to arrive in Judge <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' hands, no sir,'' <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> agreed with Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., that the case against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> would have been `` almost impregnable'' if Borders had actually passed money to <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said he felt it was significant that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> did not wait to see if this happened. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said it also was `` very important'' for his subcommittee to determine why the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decided against bringing perjury charges against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> before the statute of limitations expired in his case in January 1987. Under questioning by <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> conceded that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dredge </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> drug runner who tipped authorities to a possible bribery scheme, could have made `` false and reckless charges against the judge'' because of Dredge's known racial prejudice. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., asked <PERSON> Doar </PERSON> if `` there is any way you think you could be wrong'' in contending that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was involved in a bribery conspiracy and an attempted cover-up <PERSON> Doar </PERSON>, a former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general who was special counsel for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeachment proceedings against President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1974, said, `` No there's not.'' Later, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judges <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alaimo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, testified about their decision to file a post-acquittal complaint against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> that sparked the judicial panel's investigation. <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> said their complaint was prompted partly by an appeals court decision upholding Borders' conviction, which suggested <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> may have been involved in a conspiracy with Borders. <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> emphatically denied the complaint was filed because <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is black. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, allowed to cross-examine his fellow judges, said `` litigants will be the losers when collegiality is destroyed'' among federal judges who file charges against each other.

 The breakdown in negotiations with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the latest twist in a bizarre confrontation that has left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seemingly powerless to engineer the military chief's ouster Instead of controlling events in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policymakers seem to be the victims of a wily military chief and of their own failure to realize the strength of his grip on power. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced the collapse of the negotiations on Wednesday. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue efforts to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power, but he announced no specific steps. What to do about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been a major preoccupation of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration since February, when he was indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of taking at least $ 4.6 million in payoffs from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel to protect cocaine shipments, launder money and hide drug smugglers from law enforcement officials. It's not clear if officials ever thought they would actually be able to bring <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to trial. If they did _ or if they thought the indictment would lead to a withering of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s power _ they were mistaken. On Feb. 25, in what may have been a move suggested by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> announced <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s dismissal Then the Noriega-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> ousted <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and replaced him with Education Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure began. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration continued to recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. Federal courts blocked the withdrawal of Panamanian funds from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks. Economic sanctions were imposed. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> gave verbal support to striking Panamanians and deplored police actions against demonstrators. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials whispered privately that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be `` history'' in just a few days or weeks at most. On March 16, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> survived a coup attempt by dissident army officers and the next day a state of emergency was declared, giving soldiers power to patrol the capital. When pressure did n't work, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tried negotiations. The first offer, made March 18, was to allow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to go to a third country and to assure him he would not be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the drug charges. The offer was tempered two days later, when <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the indictments would not be dropped and that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would have no say in the formation of a transition government. By early May, the situation appeared to be in a stalemate, as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> began a set of secret negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who had predicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s imminent departure were no longer talking about it. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> was reported to have reached a tentative agreement with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> that would include his resignation as defense chief, departure from the country in August, not to return until after May 1989 elections. The deal also would permit <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to have a hand in forming a transition government. The offer divided the administration, because it included the dismissal of the drug indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the prosecutors who won the indictments denounced the proposal. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who prides himself on his loyalty to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, had to confront questions every day on whether he supported dropping the charges. Finally, he made his answer known: he said as president, he would not negotiate with drug traffickers at home or abroad. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> argued that the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> warranted the dropping of charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ since he would n't allow himself to be extradited anyway _ and the deal was set. In another demonstration of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s power to control events, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> delayed his departure for <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> on Wednesday, where he was to join <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in preparatory sessions for next week's superpower summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> His wait was in vain. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> still said, `` No.'' EDITOR'S NOTE _ <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> covers the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

 European <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members bristled at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaints that they spend too little on defense and insisted on Wednesday that they were carrying their weight in the alliance. They issued a joint rebuttal stressing their non-financial contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is taking a fair share of the burdens in the alliance,'' said <PERSON> Wim </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON>, the Dutch defense minister and chairman of Eurogroup, an informal bloc of 12 European countries. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON> and defense ministers of the other member countries presented a detailed brochure explaining their current role in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The report said that of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s standing forces, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' allies provide 90 percent of the manpower and artillery, 80 percent of the tanks and combat aircraft and 65 percent of the major warships. It said 3.5 million European men and women are on active duty and another 3.5 million are in reserve. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 2.3 million soldiers on active duty and 1.5 million in reserve, the report said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON> said he planned to address the issue on behalf of the European <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members Thursday at the regular spring meeting of alliance defense ministers, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting is expected to authorize an in-depth study of how the allies share the burdens of Western defense and how they can make better use of funds now available by cooperating more in building arms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON> told a news conference that while <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was justified in urging the allies to do more for the common defense of the West, many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were wrong to say <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is shirking its duty. `` It's one of the perceptions that have grown steadily, but it is not entirely warranted,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON> said. `` It is important that the true extent of the European contribution to the alliance be properly understood.'' He noted that the administration of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had taken a less confrontational approach to the issue than some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The West German newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying in an interview with European newspapers, `` I do n't think this is an area that should cause bad blood between us.'' The Eurogroup report acknowledged that all the allies should try to do more for the common defense, in part by better managing their budgets. `` They recognize that a stronger European defense effort is necessary in order to maintain the effectiveness of the alliance's deterrent strategy and to satisfy legitimate American concerns over burden sharing,'' the report said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON> said that while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense spending has grown much more rapidly than <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981, the comparison looks much different if calculations are based on a longer time span. Between 1970 and 1987, for example, the defense expenditures of the European <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members grew by 34 percent, compared with a 15 percent increase for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the Eurogroup report said. Actual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense spending last year was 6.7 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product, which is the broadest measure of economic output. The equivalent figure for the Europeans was 3.3 percent. The Eurogroup report said comparisons of defense spending `` tell only half the story'' of how the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies share the burdens of their common defense. It said the money figures do not take account of such other burdens born as environmental damage caused by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> military maneuvers. It also cited a sacrifice of income from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> real estate that is dedicated to military bases and other defense facilities. In a related matter, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON> said he expected Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting to issue a formal request for <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to accept the basing of 72 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 fighter jets that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is forcing off its territory The main problem, he said, is deciding how the cost of transferring the planes and 4,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> will be shared in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.

 A major logjam was broken last week when the panel agreed on provisions of an outpatient prescription drug benefit to be provided under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> for the first time. But the basic foundation of the bill was laid months ago with a variety of provisions to protect <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 31 million Medicare beneficiaries against the financial devastation of a prolonged, acute illness. Despite the conference committee agreement, some of the exact figures that will apply to individual Medicare recipients will have to be added by technical experts before the final bill is printed for passage. However, the out-of-pocket deductible for doctor bills covered by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> _ the amount paid by each recipient before government aid starts helping _ will wind up somewhere between $ 1,320 a year and $ 1,400. The hospital benefit is already set: full, 365 day-a-year coverage after a one-day deductible that rises along with average hospital costs. The 1988 deductible is $ 540. Once fully implemented in 1993, the new prescription drug benefit will pay 80 percent of those costs after a $ 655 deductible. By contrast, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> now pays no more than 80 percent of doctor bills no matter how high they climb and only 60 days of full hospital coverage after a one-day deductible. The only prescription drugs now covered by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> are a handful of particularly expensive ones such as anti-rejection medication for organ transplant patients.

 The Organization of African Unity marked its 25th anniversary Wednesday with calls to unite to crush South African apartheid and to resolve <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s $ 200 billion debt. President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> chairman, celebrated the anniversary with a chorus of `` Happy Birthday, <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION>,'' as he cut a cake. The African states declared `` our determination to be master of our own destiny'' in an 11-page declaration marking the jubilee. The states called for total political and economical liberation of the continent. Many of the 40 points in the declaration resembled previous <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> resolutions. The declaration offers no new plans of action. It expressed disappointment at `` inadequate support'' provided by the international community despite promises to provide money to help <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> put austerity programs into effect. Groups from <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> danced and sang as African leaders planted trees and unveiled a marble plaque with gold engraving of the organization's silver jubilee theme: Unity, Solidarity, Liberation, Development. A helicopter gunship roared overhead, but otherwise security was light for the more than 30 heads of government and state gathered at the 50-member body's headquarters in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital In <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, which won independence eight years ago and is the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION>'s youngest member state, the <ORGANIZATION> Harare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> newspaper praised the organization as having played a key role in ending colonial domination, prescribing ways of resolving the African debt, and promoting regional cooperation in transport, communications, health programs and refugee care. Those attending the celebration in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> included <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, who wore a dark suit; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawlings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, in camouflage fatigues and dark glasses; <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, in flowing white robes and turban; and Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Babangida </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, in khaki dress uniform emblazoned with red and gold braid. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> said that although 19 African nations had achieved independence since the organization's founding May 25, 1963, the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> should resist complacency. `` <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> must rise to strike the last blow against the racist regime of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to rid the continent of the last bastion of racism and colonialism,'' he said. `` We must therefore be even more united than before.'' The celebration is followed by a three-day summit that begins Thursday. Denunciation of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is a familiar theme at <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> gatherings and summits, which always end with calls to crush apartheid and with criticism of Western governments for failing to impose mandatory sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-dominated government. The <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> also calls regularly for the freeing of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which is under South African control. At the same time, black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> does about $ 1 billion a year in business with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, much of it covertly. The state-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said in a commentary that the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> had failed to resolve the continent's major problems. `` There will be much South Africa-bashing to cover up the lack of unity, the social and economic crisis that plagues the continent _ and the heart-rending suffering of the people of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' it said of the gathering. OAU Secretary-general <PERSON> Ide </PERSON> <PERSON> Oumarou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s economic problems have weakened the organization's impact `` The words of a united <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would have been more resounding if its political and diplomatic influence had been matched by its economic power,'' he said. President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> could count among its successes the rapprochement between <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, who restored diplomatic ties in April after an 11-year break following the <LOCATION> Ogaden </LOCATION> desert war. The <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> was not directly involved in the Ethiopia-Somalia rapprochement and has had limited success in mediation. Last year, <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> persuaded members <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to accept a cease-fire in their territorial dispute after the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> failed to do so. President <PERSON> Hissene </PERSON> <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> of <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> attended the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION>'s silver jubilee, but Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> stayed away from the meeting, as he has in recent years.

 <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday that getting the television rights to the 1992 Winter Olympics was the first step in rebuilding the beleaguered network and making it No. 1 again. `` It's going to be a hard fight, but we're ready for an all-out assault,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said. The longtime ratings leader among the three major networks slipped to last place this season. But <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said the network's winning $ 243 million bid Tuesday for the Winter Games in <LOCATION> Albertville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, shows that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> is determined to regain its former status `` We're on the right track _ we just have to get the train moving faster,'' he said at a news conference. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, which last televised the Olympics in 1960, outbid <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> by $ 68 million for the <LOCATION> Albertville </LOCATION> Games. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilson </PERSON> said he expected CBS to make a small profit on the Games, but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pilson </PERSON> was `` blowing smoke.'' <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, also chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, called the bid `` very realistic.'' `` I think we can make money,'' he said. `` At worst, I see us breaking even.'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the bid reflected <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` new aggressiveness.'' `` We are not the No. 1 network, but we intend to be,'' he said. `` We have promised our affiliates that we will go after the big events, and that's what we're doing.''

<TEXT>
 A newspaper said Wednesday the army rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down because it did not guarantee his chosen president would remain in power. `` The high command of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> rejected the points of conversation because they found no guarantee of the continuity of the constitutional mandate of President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>,'' said the pro-government <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION>, citing sources it did not identify. The front-page story carried the headline `` There is No Agreement.'' It said the military believed `` there would be security risks, political confrontations among Panamanians'' and that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal would impede the process of turning over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Treaties signed in 1977 require the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to relinquish control of the canal on Dec. 31, 1999. The report in the afternoon paper said the military leaders felt any further talks should be held `` in a broader parameter in which other sectors of the Panamanian state might be included.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced Wednesday afternoon in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the talks had collapsed. When the negotiations on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal began several weeks ago, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> insisted on retaining <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as president. That position appeared to have softened recently. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was deposed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Feb. 26, a day after the president tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s presidency. There was no immediate public comment from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on the failure of the talks. He is to address the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, said an assembly spokesman. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the head of the 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, is under federal indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for drug trafficking. Removal of the indictments was reportedly part of the agreement that had been considered. Other terms were said to be lifting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at least temporarily and agreement on who should head the civilian government until May 1989 elections. Sources close to <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s chief negotiator with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> early Wednesday that the two sides still had not reached agreement on what would happen to $ 50 million in Panamanian funds frozen in American banks and on the status of <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> installed as president after deposing <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. Hours later, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced that the talks were off. <PERSON> DelValle </PERSON> has been in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since he was deposed and warrants are out for his arrest, although the Panamian government has made no serious recent attempt to find him. The military has been the de facto ruler in this country of 2.2 million since 1968 when Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>. Panamanian-American relations have dropped in the past year to a 25-year low. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions have taken a heavy toll on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy. International confidence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banking industry has been shaken and scores of businesses have gone bankrupt or are struggling to stay open. The opposition press has been silenced since early this year. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said recently it may take a generation to restore <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to what it was economically and socially before the crisis.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Japanese Parliament on Wednesday approved a new nuclear cooperation pact with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had accepted earlier. The 30-year agreement allows <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to transfer spent nuclear fuel from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reprocessing plants in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> without seeking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> permission each time. It was required to do so under a previous agreement. The new accord also limits cooperation to peaceful purposes and allows <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to bring in American-made nuclear materials, including plutonium, which can be used to make nuclear weapons. During heated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional debate on the pact in March, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, expressed concern about potential risks of nuclear proliferation, terrorism and environmental damage. <PERSON> Yozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosokawa </PERSON>, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the new pact will go into effect as early as fall.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> announced Wednesday for the first time how many casualties it suffered in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, with a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> general telling a nationwide television audience that 13,310 soldiers died in the war. Gen. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON> also said 35,478 soldiers were wounded and 311 are missing from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 8 -LCB- - year battle with Moslem insurgents Soviet soldiers began leaving their bases May 15 in accordance with a peace accord signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that aims to end foreign involvement in the Afghan civil war and improve chances for internal resolution of the 10-year-old conflict. The general said in a news briefing which was also carried on the evening news program `` Vremya'' that the death and injury tolls included casualties suffered between Dec. 27, 1979, when Soviet troops and tanks entered the war, and May 1. The total of 49,099 dead, wounded and missing was slightly higher than some Western analysts estimated. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report last year estimated there had been 33,000 to 38,000 casualties, about one-third of which were deaths. <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON> said the Soviet government would make every effort to learn the fate of the missing soldiers, and indicated that there would be no barriers to the return of those `` who fell into the hands of the opposition or found themselves abroad.'' He appeared to be referring to deserters as well as prisoners of war. <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON>'s casualty figures were in line with Soviet journalist <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosental </PERSON>'s statement May 19 that news reports estimating deaths between 12,000 and 15,000 were `` more or less correct.'' The war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> often has been compared to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where about 58,000 Americans were killed and about 150,000 were wounded. Since the withdrawal began 10 days ago, 9,500 Soviet troops have left their bases, as well as 1,000 pieces of military equipment, <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON> reported. Asked whether the departing forces had suffered any casualties, the general replied that there had been `` attempts to prevent them from leaving,'' but that there had been no marked increase in rebel attacks. He declined to verify the size of the Soviet contingent in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But Western intelligence reports have indicated that prior to the start of the withdrawal, about 115,000 Soviet soldiers were in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to back the government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> against anti-communist rebels. <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON> and Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> held fast to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> position that sending Soviet troops into a neighboring country's civil war was justified. `` Soviet troops had been invited to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by the government,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said. `` That is a fact. This can not be reassessed.'' <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON> was asked whether <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> advisers would remain behind after the withdrawal is completed, and replied that if the Afghans appealed for such assistance, `` we would consider this request.'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last month that his government was counting on the continued help of Soviet advisers. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> was asked whether the retreat signaled an end to the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> <PERSON> Doctrine </PERSON>, former leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s policy of military intervention to protect socialist revolutionary gains. `` This was not our baby,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said of the doctrine. But he added that the Soviet armed forces are committed to protecting allies as well as Soviet territory. <PERSON> Lizichev </PERSON> said Soviet policy has not changed, that conditions appeared only recently that allowed the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to leave the Afghan troops to fight on their own. Soviet officials and the state-run media have cast the pullout as a successful conclusion to the war. The U.N.-mediated <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords require all Soviet soldiers to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> within nine months, and half of the contingent to withdraw by Aug. 15. Lt.-Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, head of the Afghan-based troops, told reporters in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> before the start of the withdrawal that 25 percent of the soldiers would leave before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which begins Sunday Earlier Wednesday, the Afghan government charged for the fourth time in recent days that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is violating provisions of the peace accord that prohibit arms transfers to the anti-communist rebels. Much of the weaponry supplied to the insurgents has come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> joked that some of the U.S.-supplied Stinger missiles provided to the rebels have been captured by Soviet forces. After claiming that the insurgents were selling the Stingers to other countries for as much as $ 300,000, <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> had obtained some `` free of charge.''

<HEAD>Woman Investigated After Four Infants Die</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman who said she had `` had it up to my nose with doctors and monitors with my children'' is under criminal investigation after she had four children die before the age of 4 months, officials said Wednesday. A family court judge ruled that <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, were guilty of `` at the very least, gross negligence'' and issued a finding of abuse of their only surviving child, a 10-month-old boy who is currently in foster care. One of the children who died had previously been held at a hospital because the city's <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> had received anonymous reports that the mother was killing her children for insurance money to sustain her drug habit, Judge <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON> said in her report. <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> confirmed Wednesday she was investigating the three deaths that occurred in her borough. `` The circumstances under which these infants died are under investigation by my office. This matter is being taken very seriously and is being investigated thoroughly,'' <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON> called the parents' descriptions of how their children died `` inconsistent and incredible'' in the May 2 decision, made public Tuesday. The decision was in response to a petition by the city alleging that the <ORGANIZATION> Lamberts </ORGANIZATION> abused their surviving child, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, through reckless disregard for his care. No specific acts of physical abuse were alleged. A hearing to determine the child's future is scheduled for Friday. A call to the Lamberts' attorney, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Karan </PERSON>, was not returned Wednesday. <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON>'s decision outlined the deaths of the four infants. The report, based on the <ORGANIZATION> Lamberts </ORGANIZATION>' testimony, medical and social workers' accounts and other records, said: _ <PERSON> Kristen </PERSON>, the couple's first child, died in August 1983 five weeks after birth in <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, of apparent natural causes The medical examiner's report said the baby died of cardiac arrest and pneumonia. _ A daughter, <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>, was hospitalized three weeks after birth in June 1985 for an apnea disorder, described as a tendency to stop breathing without cause She died in July at age 5 weeks, just 1 -LCB- days after being released from the hospital. The judge said <ORGANIZATION> Maimonides </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> Lamberts </ORGANIZATION> a monitor to record <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s breathing and heart rate. The parents testified they used the monitor but `` aspects of their description ... lacked veracity,'' <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s cause of death was given as sudden infant death syndrome, but no autopsy was performed because the parents opposed it. _ A third daughter, <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>, was diagnosed as having drug withdrawal symptoms shortly after birth Oct. 10, 1986, and doctors recommended that she be monitored for the apnea disorder She died Feb. 9, 1987. Mrs. <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> admitted she missed <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s follow-up medical appointments and told the judge she `` had it up to my nose with doctors and monitors with my children,'' the judge's decision said. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s cause of death was listed as SIDS but later changed to `` sudden unexplained death, circumstances undetermined.'' _ The last infant to die was <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, the twin of surviving <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON> said the twins were kept at a hospital after the children's services department received the anonmymous reports that the mother had killed the children to collect insurance The department had previously received such reports, the judge's decision said A social worker was assigned to the family after the third death and had been in contact with the parents. The allegations of abuse were evidently not confirmed, and the twins were released to the parents, authorities said. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> died last October, with the cause of death listed as SIDS. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was then placed in foster care.

<TEXT>
 A 78-year-old man who has never even received a traffic ticket now may go to prison for killing his ailing wife. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> has admitted he shot and killed his wife, <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON>, at a nursing home Feb. 29, but said he did so to end her suffering from Alzheimer's disease. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for a maximum 43-month sentence. The agreement departs from state sentencing guidelines, which call for an 18-year sentence for second-degree murder. Still, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s attorneys held out hope that during sentencing, <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> would send the retired farmer to a nursing home where he could be cared for and receive counseling. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> has been free on bond. `` He believes what he did was right,'' said attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. `` But over and above that I believe we have presented significant evidence to show the great pressure he was under from caring for her.'' A hearing was held Wednesday, but a decision was delayed a day when the prosecutor said one witness could not appear until Thursday. Douglas County Attorney <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrott </PERSON> had opposed even the 43-month sentence. Although she feels compassion toward <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, she said, she believes sentencing guidelines should be followed. She also presented a witness Wednesday who suggested that Mrs. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> had been abused by her husband. `` The focus of the defense attorneys has been on the stress that <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> was under, and obviously there are some issues of the life of the victim and her general surroundings that I believe are just as important,'' Ms. <PERSON> Carrott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> testified last month during his sentencing hearing that his wife of nearly 47 years asked to be shot. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said he shot her four times with a .22 - caliber pistol and then sat down to pray and watch her The shooting occurred at the <LOCATION> Crestview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION> a day after <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> had broken a hip in a fall. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> testified that when he heard his wife, who had suffered four years with Alzheimer's disease, would require surgery `` my mind cracked.'' `` I could n't take no more,'' he said. Relatives said they were crushed by Mrs. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s death, but forgave <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. `` He's still our father and we understand it was hard on him,'' said <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Penuel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s youngest daughter. `` Alzheimer's is a disease that's very hard on the caretaker. `` I hope that some good will come out of this and people will be a little more understanding of those who are caring for sufferers of Alzheimer's disease.'' All three of <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s daughters testified last month that they hoped their father would be shown leniency because of the strain he was under and his age. `` We're talking about a man who's never even had a traffic ticket before this,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Reif </PERSON>, another attorney representing <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. `` I do not think sending him to prison at his age would serve society at all.'' But during Wednesday's hearing, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Crestview </LOCATION> nursing home, testified that staff members became concerned about Mrs. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> and the care she received when <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> took her out of the nursing home for brief visits at home. She said staff members noticed bruises on Mrs. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s body after some of the visits. After returning from one visit in August 1987, Mrs. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> told the staff, `` I'm glad to be here. That man really pounded on me,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said, reading from a nursing report. On cross-examination by <PERSON> Reif </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said nursing officials were aware that Mrs. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> bruised easily and sometimes, because of her Alzheimer's, said things that were untrue. She said an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> determined that reports of alleged abuse were unfounded. <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>, administrator of the home, also testified Wednesday, saying that <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> had complained to her on numerous occasions about the cost of Mrs. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s care.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Says Libya's War with Chad Is Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> on Wednesday declared an end to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s war with <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> and said he now recognizes the <LOCATION> Chadian </LOCATION> government, Libyan television reported. The Libyan leader also said that Chadian prisoners will be handed over to the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> and that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> will resolve all its problems with <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> in a `` friendly and fraternal way.'' He made his remarks to African ambassadors in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, the Libyan capital, in a speech marking the 25th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION>. The address was broadcast by Libyan television and monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has declared the <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> war over before, most recently in September 1987. He said he was making his Wednesday declaration so the 50-nation <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> _ which has been trying to resolve the <LOCATION> Libya-Chad </LOCATION> dispute for 12 years _ could concentrate on solving <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s economic problems, confronting racism in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, supporting the Palestinians, and other issues. A spokesman for <PERSON> Chad </PERSON>'s delegation at the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, said Wednesday night that President <PERSON> Hissene </PERSON> <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> could not be reached for comment because of the late hour. However, the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> said Tuesday he was `` very optimistic'' about the possibility of resolving the dispute with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also used the occasion to declare unilaterally that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> will resume ties with eight <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries _ <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` We want this day to be a day of joy for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and a reduction in the burden of the organization so that it may devote itself to the historic objectives for which it was set up: the unity of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the liberation of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said. `` In order to salute and express appreciation for this day, the day of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the leadership of the -LRB- Libyan -RRB- revolution wants to declare the following as a present to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on the 25th anniversary. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> declares its recognition of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and ends all the outstanding problems between it and <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> declared a cease-fire last September, but <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> of continuing to mass troops for an attack. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> entered <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> in 1983 in support of rebels led by former Chadian President <PERSON> Goukouni </PERSON> <PERSON> Queddei </PERSON>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the one-time colonial ruler of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, gave military support to <PERSON> Habre </PERSON>, who ousted <PERSON> Goukouni </PERSON> in June 1982. <PERSON> Habre </PERSON>'s forces pushed Libyan troops out of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> early last year, but <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> continued to dispute the mineral-rich <LOCATION> Aouzou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>'s extreme northern border. An <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> committe was set up to examine the issue. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Goukouni </PERSON> and <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> to met in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and said `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> will do its utmost for the sake of national reconciliation between them.'' He said that if <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> does return to civil war, `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> announces that it will not intervene.'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was offering what he described as a Libyan `` Marshall Plan'' to reconstruct northern <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. The Marshall Plan was set up by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to aid in European recovery after World War II. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also said that that under the Libyan Constitution the country did not to have a head of state and so his absence at the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> meeting should not offend that organization.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, dogged by a foreign policy problem he wanted to leave behind, arrived here early Thursday en route to a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> after proclaiming that superpower relations have `` come a long way'' since their 1985 face-off in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Less than an hour before <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One touched down, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> announced the collapse of negotiations to get <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to relinquish power. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I do n't feel weakened'' by the foreign policy setback going into the summit. The administration had hoped the long stalemate with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be broken before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reaches <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, thus sparing him any embarrassment that would distract attention from the talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Asked at a picture-taking session with Finnish President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> if he felt foolish about the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> situation, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` I just do n't feel that way.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced the negotiations had reached an impasse and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was withdrawing its offer to drop drug charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if he left the country. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was upbeat as he left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, giving a mostly sunny assessment of relations between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But he acknowledged that `` we have many differences _ deep differences.'' `` There will be plenty of work for Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and me in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next week,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` I do not expect it to be easy.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not take with him a ratified Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty, but <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders said they hoped to win approval of the pact by week's end so it can be rushed to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for a ceremonial exchange of treaty-ratification documents with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It was with much pomp that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the treaty during their last meeting _ in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> planned to use the four-day <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> stopover to prepare for the summit and to adjust to the eight-hour time difference between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He was greeted at the <LOCATION> Helsinki-Vantaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tellervo </PERSON>. Spotlights flooded the tarmac and a red carpet was rolled out to Air Force One for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arrival. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at mid-afternoon Sunday for a four-day summit expected to be short on substance and long on ceremony. He had conceded beforehand that there was virtually no likelihood of a breakthrough on a long-range missile accord. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trip marks the first visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by a sitting president since <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> made separate trips there in 1974. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 77, has never visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, although he spent much of his long career speaking of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s challenges in the face of rising <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> power. Reflecting on his three previous summits with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, beginning with the November 1985 meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the president said in his remarks Wednesday: `` We have come a long way since then.'' However, he said, `` We have many differences _ deep differences, moral differences. But we are still fellow human beings. We can still work together to keep the peace.'' The face-off in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> follows summits between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>; in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> in October 1986 and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also has held out the possibility of a fifth get-together later this year _ if the two sides are close to agreement on a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Several hundred people, including Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubynin </PERSON>, stood on the South Lawn of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to hear the president make his departure remarks as aides held umbrellas over him and the first lady. But the umbrella failed to keep the president dry. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was overheard remarking to him: `` Honey, you're just soaked.'' He answered, `` I know it.'' She then asked, `` Why did n't you put on a raincoat?'' His answer could not be heard. As the brief ceremony ended, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> precision flight team staged a low-altitude fly-by. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> outlined high expectations for the summit _ with the caveat that `` I do not expect it to be easy.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he will press <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for continued human rights improvements, for help in ending conflicts in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and for assistance to `` prevent a manmade crisis of starvation'' in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. He gave a laundry list of superpower accomplishments in recent years, including the medium-range missile treaty, and said he could supply more evidence of improved relations, `` but I'd miss my plane.'' `` My task next week will be to go still farther, farther in the interests of peace, farther toward a universal respect for fundamental human rights, farther toward world freedom, farther toward a safer world for all people,'' he said. `` We will urge the Soviets to help move the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process closer to a just and lasting solution,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` And we will look for ways to help the parties resolve other regional conflicts in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and yes, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will spend three days relaxing in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, making final summit preparations and trying to adjust to the eight-hour time difference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> will stay in a third-floor suite of a plush guest house equipped with a small indoor pool and sauna. It is located in a suburb about a 15-minute drive from downtown <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>. Soon after his arrival in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will begin their first round of talks at the Kremlin. Both nations say it will be impossible to wrap up a treaty next week to curb strategic nuclear weapons. But officials on both sides say they hope to make progress in ironing out some obstacles in hopes an agreement will be completed before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next January. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will make new proposals to keep track of mobile missiles, one of the key disputes blocking a treaty.

 Two honey-haired young girls brought traffic to a crawl and tears to the eyes of motorists reading their sign `` Will Work For Food.'' <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, 8, and her sister <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, 6, were holding the sign Tuesday for their father, who moved his family from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> earlier this month and spent their $ 1,500 savings in the process. The sight of the blue-eyed girls and their cardboard sign inspired an outpouring of $ 20 bills and sympathy. `` I saw those two kids there and I just started crying,'' said <LOCATION> Hallandale </LOCATION> postal worker <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> McLoughlin </PERSON>, 36, who gave the children's father, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, $ 3 in coins. `` It was all I had,'' she said, before returning 30 minutes later to give him two $ 20 bills. In two hours, Cannon collected $ 135 and the promise of a day's work Saturday for $ 100 Even police contributed, but the officer who pushed $ 5 into <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>'s hand refused to be identified. State social workers were not touched. They told Cannon his children should have been in school where they have been registered. `` You're doing a dangerous thing, having these kids out here,'' said social worker <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` You should n't be playing upon the emotions of people with these kids.'' <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said he would not use the girls to seek work again. `` I just want to get on my feet,'' he said.

 Israeli-allied militiamen backed by Israeli air strikes stormed guerrilla bases in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Pro-Iranian guerrillas reported 25 of their fighters killed and 20 missing. Police also said four Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed the Palestinian refugee camp <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Hilweh </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s outskirts late Wednesday, killing a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla and wounding four. The helicopters, dropping parachute flares, destroyed a base of the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla faction of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in the 10:05 p.m. -LRB- 4:05 p.m. EDT -RRB- strike, police said. The Israeli army command in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> later announced that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes hit the <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Hilweh </PERSON> base at about 11 p.m. and scored accurate hits despite anti-aircraft fire. Despite discrepancies, the Israeli and the Lebanese accounts apparently were referring to the same air strike. Earlier in the day, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said 25 of its men were killed in a daylong sweep by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia supported by Israeli helicopter gunships. A <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> statement issued in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said 17 guerillas were wounded and 20 were missing. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> said five of its fighters were injured. The assault on three villages in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> began at daybreak and ended at nightfall, when the attacking force rolled back to its base in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated `` security zone,'' the <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> radio station said. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> instructed its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission to `` lodge a strong worded complaint against the Israeli-sponsored aggression'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an official statement said. The action in the south came as <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> concentrated its efforts on the battle for control of Shiite Moslem slums in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> reportedly warned <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> not to harm any of the 18 foreign hostages _ including nine Americans _ believed held in the slums, site of a bloody 20-day battle between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the pro-Syrian Amal militia. The <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> that harming any of the hostages would be viewed as an `` infringement of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s security.'' It gave no source for its report and did not elaborate. Syrian spokesmen declined comment. The captive held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was captured on March 16, 1985. A Belgian physician, Dr. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cools </PERSON>, was reported missing Wednesday in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but there was no word on whether he had been kidnapped. The Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Cools, 32, a general practitioner, left the Qasimiyeh refugee camp on Saturday, heading for the <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> shantytown eight miles to the south. He never reached <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> consolidated its grip on more than 90 percent of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Syrian troops and tanks surround the slums and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has threatened to move in and stop the battle. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s acting prime minister, <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, drove to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> for a meeting with Vice President <PERSON> Abdul-Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Sources close to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said he asked that the Syrian army be sent into the slums and that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, speaker of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to make a similar plea <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally but has been alarmed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s attempt through <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to dominate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites, the largest sect in the country The intensity of the south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> slum war decreased significantly Wednesday, with only automatic weapons fire reported. Police said they had no word on casualties. The fighting has killed 296 people and wounded 1,000 since May 6. A police spokesman said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> was reorganizing its forces, apparently preparing `` for a final push'' against <PERSON> Shiyah </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s last stronghold in the 16 square miles of slums

 An attorney for Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says he is n't convinced talks are off between the indicted Panamanian leader and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, despite Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s statement to that effect Wednesday. `` I've heard that only from the secretary of state, and I remember hearing the secretary of state say that last March,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> said after the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announcement. `` That was followed by more negotiations over the last 10 days, so I do n't think it would be useful to comment on whether the negotiations are at a permanent end or not,'' said <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, one of several <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorneys for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who faces drug indictments in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. The federal prosecutors who brought those indictments last February remain eager to meet him him in court rather than have charges dropped in a poltical deal in which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would give up power. `` I stand ready to prosecute Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. However, getting the defendant to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to stand trial wo n't be easy because <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> can not be extradited by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` I offered him a trip to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, but I do n't think he'll take me up on that,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>'s successful prosecution of Colombian drug kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> took place after <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was captured in a Colombian jungle and immediately flown to <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is charged in a 12-count indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> with taking at least $ 4.6 million in payoffs from the violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel led by <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and others. The three-count Tampa indictment accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of helping smuggle 1 million pounds of marijuana. Both <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, were opposed to dropping their drug charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in exchange for his giving up power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` All I can say is we are prepared to go forward with the case and we will do so,'' <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said, declining further comment. But <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> said he thought charges against his client could well be dismissed _ and not necessarily as a result of negotiations. `` I have continued to work on our motion for dismissal of the indictment on legal grounds and we will continue to do so,'' he said. `` We still feel that we have a strong case for dismissal on a variety on various grounds.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 that lost all power and made an emergency landing on a narrow canal bank was battered by hail, but possible fuel problems were also being examined, officials said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> jet carrying about 40 passengers lost power in both its engines twice Tuesday afternoon about 20 miles from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The pilot set the plane safely down between a drainage ditch and the Intracoastal Waterway. `` As far as we know, this is the first successful off-airport dead-stick -LRB- no power -RRB- landing of a commercial jet,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wandel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> inspector. <PERSON> Wandel </PERSON> said it was too early to tell if the rough weather had caused both jet engines to lose power. `` We have to look at the commonality of both engines -LRB- losing power -RRB-, so it could be a fuel problem,'' <ORGANIZATION> Wandel </ORGANIZATION> said. J.O. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, had said earlier Wednesday that the plane's engines could have suffered damage from hail while the jet passed through a storm front along most of the Gulf Coast region. But <PERSON> Wandel </PERSON> said an initial inspection of the engine turbines did not suggest hail damage as the cause of their failure. He said the plane had approximately 12,800 pounds of fuel on board, leading investigators to believe the problem could have been fuel contamination. He also would not rule out the possibility that lightning hit the plane and said it would be several months before the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> releases a report on a probable cause. Examination of the plane could be finished by Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Wandel </ORGANIZATION> said, and then officials must decide how to remove it from the canal bank. He said the plane could either be flown off the grassy strip or moved by barge along the <LOCATION> Intracoastal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Waterway </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Lakefront Airport. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said flying it out would be better. `` I suspect they'll probably grade -LRB- the strip -RRB- down and fly it out later,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Federal and airline officials have not confirmed the number of people aboard the plane, but have placed the figure at 36 to 45. <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, but has business offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The pilot, identified as <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardano </PERSON>, landed the jet on the narrow strip on the grounds of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Michoud facility in eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> after it twice lost power in both engines. The plane was at 11,000 feet when the engines died the first time; the control tower at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> diverted the plane to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Air Station at suburban <LOCATION> Belle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chasse </LOCATION>, 15 miles away. The pilot then managed to restart both engines, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> source said, and asked for clearance to land at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> International. However, the plane's power failed again at about 5,000 feet, and the pilot was directed to the small, but less congested <LOCATION> Lakefront </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> about six miles away, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> source said. The pilot responded with two `` Mayday'' messages and began looking for somewhere else to land, the source said. <PERSON> Saidy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, 35, a vacationing teacher at the national university in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, said she and other passengers showed their appreciation for the captain's work with a round of applause _ `` a big one.'' <PERSON> Dardano </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, has been with <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION> about five years, <PERSON> Messina </PERSON> said, adding `` He's a pretty cool captain. He does n't get flustered very easily.''

<TEXT>
 A record company executive, a reputed mob figure and a third man were convicted Wednesday on federal conspiracy charges in a case authorities called an example of organized crime influence in the recording industry. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Roulette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, and two associates _ <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dominick </PERSON> <PERSON> Canterino </PERSON> _ were convicted of two counts each of conspiring to commit extortion. They were charged with an attempted shakedown of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaMonte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Darby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who ran a record wholesale company, in a 1985 dispute over $ 1.25 million in records and tapes from <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> has not been charged in the case. After a three-week trial, the jury deliberated about 4 -LCB- hours over two days before convicting <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, 60, the comptroller of <ORGANIZATION> Roulette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Canterino </PERSON>, 57, whom law enforcement officials described as a member of the Genovese organized crime family. Attorneys for the defendants said they would appeal the verdicts. Federal Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brotman </PERSON>, whose district includes <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>, scheduled sentencing for July 8. Each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> said the government won its case on the merits of hours of taped conversations obtained by government wiretaps at <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>'s office and other locations. `` We did n't offer a whole lot beyond the tapes,'' <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> said. After opening statements in the case, <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> told <PERSON> Brotman </PERSON> the government would prove that the case involved reputed mob ties. `` The organized crime element is there,'' <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> documents filed in the case said government agencies believed <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, a self-made millionaire, has been involved with organized crime for 20 years. But <PERSON> Brotman </PERSON> ordered prosecutors not to discuss organized crime connections during the course of the trial. <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON>, in a meeting with reporters following the verdict, declined to comment on whether the jury drew conclusions that organized crime played a role in the case. `` Mr. <PERSON> Canterino </PERSON> did not drop in from Mars,'' said <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON>, who asked the judge to raise bail on Canterino and <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> from $ 500,000 to $ 5 million cash. `` It's been reported that Mr. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> wishes to go to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> told the judge while describing <PERSON> Canterino </PERSON> as a high-ranking member of the conspiracy. The judge ordered bail for Canterino and <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> to be raised to $ 1 million that will be secured by a $ 15 million farm belonging to <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>. Defense attorneys assured the judge the men would turn in their passports to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> and would not apply for new passports. `` He is n't going anywhere,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>'s attorney, <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, told the judge. During the trial, the defense attacked record wholesaler <PERSON> LaMonte </PERSON>'s credibility, calling the man an ex-con with a history of criminal activity. <PERSON> LaMonte </PERSON>, who served 18 months in prison for a 1977 conviction for bootlegging records, agreed to wear a wiretap while meeting with the three men over an 18-month period. He did not testify in this case, however. `` <PERSON> LaMonte </PERSON> and his business were the victims of this extortion,'' <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> said. Defense attorneys also alleged through the trial that one of <PERSON> LaMonte </PERSON>'s three partners in record wholesale firm was <PERSON> Gaetano </PERSON> <PERSON> Vastola </PERSON>, a reputed member of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> organized crime family. <PERSON> Vastola </PERSON> and three co-defendants go on trial this fall before <PERSON> Brotman </PERSON> on federal rackeetering charges related to the <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> case, <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> said.

 Graduation ceremonies at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, were both marked Wednesday by rainy skies and warnings not to underestimate the Soviets. `` It may be cold and blustery out here, but this ceremony will be a warm and friendly one,'' Rear Adm. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marryott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> superintendent, told the thousands gathered in Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium to watch graduation exercises for the class of 1988 as a light rain began to fall. The academy's class of 1,041 graduates included 77 women, 46 Hispanics, 38 blacks, 36 Orientals, two native Americans and seven citizens of six foreign nations. Immediately after receiving their diplomas, 855 of the graduates were sworn in as <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ensigns nd 174 as <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> 2nd lieutenants. Five graduates will become 2nd lieutenants in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, and the foreign students will return home. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told the graduates that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> welcomes signs of change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but must remain aware that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms could mask a resurgence of Soviet military power. `` The departure of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today for the summit demonstrates a commitment to explore all reasonable avenues to lessen the tensions that divide us,'' he said. If <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s goal `` is to change Soviet society in a way that makes it less aggressive in its expansionist policies, then we will all have gained,'' said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` On the other hand, if the West heeds the siren call and relaxes its security guard, only to awaken to a rebirth of Soviet military power, based on a modernized and technologically advanced industrial base, then we will have made an enormous miscalculation.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as `` Star Wars,'' the first major step in reversing nuclear military capabilities from an offensive to a defensive force. He predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will play a greater role in the military's space involvement. `` Imaginative thinking is under way,'' he said, `` as can be seen in proposals to use naval platforms to launch replacement satellites in the event of a conflict. Thus, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will unquestionably adapt to the nation's changing defense requirements. He also recommended <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy makers `` carefully construct our security relationship'' with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, countries he predicted would exert greater economic and political influences on the world in the future. At <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> graduated its 190th class, sending 939 new junior officers into the armed forces. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> and Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Weest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> superintendent, handed out diplomas to 849 men and 90 women in a rain-drenched ceremony at <LOCATION> Michie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>. In the commencement address, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized what he called the `` liberal elite'' who, he said, never understood that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must be dealt with from strength. `` They are so blinded by ideology that they can not see what Americans have understood for 40 years; that peace flows from strength,'' the Republican presidential aspirant said in what was billed as a non-political speech. Political campaigning is prohibited at military installations. The vice president told the cadets that it was a good thing that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> engaged in summit meetings, but he said <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> must not become complacent about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> threat just because the two sides were talking. He said the times require leadership that `` will pursue negotiations with the Soviet realistically.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraley </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Irondale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, was at the top of the class, finishing with the best academic record and also winning a Rhodes scholarship. The class boasted a second Rhodes scholar, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagl </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb. The class goat was <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Klee </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` Too much socializing and not enough studying,'' was <PERSON> Klee </PERSON>'s explanation for his finishing at the bottom academically. The goat is not formally designated by the academy, and the identity of the cadet who squeaked through becomes known only because of the extra-loud cheers when his name is read. He also is slipped a bag of money collected by classmates relieved at having escaped his fate.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anti-American sentiment expressed by radical <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> students is `` not shared by the mainstream,'' a senior government official said Wednesday. An influential newspaper on Wednesday meanwhile accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of meddling in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> affairs, but opposed calls for expulsion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. <PERSON> Hyun </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong-choo </PERSON>, minister of legislation, said: `` We are confident the majority of the people are happy with our relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He was commenting at a lunch with the press about a wave of anti-government and anti-American demonstrations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> cities in the past week. Referring to calls by some radicals for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to relinquish its operational control of the South Korean army, <PERSON> Hyun </PERSON> said the government `` feels there should be changes as time progreses and situations change.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 42,000 troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> general heads the combined military forces. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> resent `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference in domestic politics and economy in a high-handed manner, its support for dictatorship and coercive demands to open Korean markets.'' Radicals contend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has supported military rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and encourages the continued division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The peninsula was divided in 1945 into communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and pro-Western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` The recent anti-U.S. criticism apparently indicates students and dissidents are mounting a major anti-U.S. campaign aimed at the removal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION> said. But the newspaper backed the presence of the American troops. It called on Koreans to maintain critical but balanced views of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> instead of blind opposition. The editorial's criticism of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was quite unusual for the South Korean press. Student protesters claim <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is not a democracy, as they did during the authoritarian regime of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s predecessor and ally, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was elected last December in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s first direct elections in 16 years.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> TALLAHASSEE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- The lawmaker proposing a statewide cooling-off period for handgun sales Wednesday withdrew a version of his bill weakened by legislators he accused of knuckling under to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I can not personally allow the bill in its current posture to come out with my name on it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is a very powerful, financially secure organization and the Legislature is responding more to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> than to the people of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' Silver distributed a memo to the other 119 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members decrying a Tuesday vote that reduced his proposed weeklong waiting period to three working days at the option of each county. The proposed constitutional amendment would have been put to voters in a November referendum. State law already allows counties to enact waiting periods of up to two days. A lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> dismissed Silver's claims that the association was improperly influencing lawmakers. `` He knows that's not true,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sportsmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> arm. `` There's no hue and cry out there for waiting periods ... He only wants to let the people decide if he can pick the question. Who's fooling who?'' <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> said he will mount a petition drive to place the seven-day question on the ballot anyway, which will require him to collect several hundred thousand signatures of registered voters across the state by August. If that drive succeeds and voters adopt the constitutional amendment, <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> said he would push separate legislation to require gun buyers to sign their intent to purchase weapons. The current 48-hour waiting period, which several counties have enacted, has been faulted because it does n't require written intent to purchase a weapon. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who sponsored the amendment to weaken <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>'s proposal as well as last year's controversial law that made it easier for Floridians to carry concealed weapons, responded to <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>'s memo by telling his colleague, `` I find it personally offensive.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating effort to induce <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to go into exile this summer collapsed Wednesday and no further talks are planned, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> announced. `` At the final moment in negotiations, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would not carry through with the arrangements his representatives had negotiated,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told a hastily-arranged news conference. `` No offers remain on the table,'' he said. Under Secretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had indicated that `` majors and captains'' within <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> `` might take strong action'' against him if he agreed to the deal The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been seeking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal since his indicment in February by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of taking at least $ 4.6 million in payoffs from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel to protect cocaine shipments, launder money and hide drug smugglers from law enforcement officials. The collapse of the talks came as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was flying to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> on the first leg of his summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next week with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Upon arrival, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked at a picture-taking session with Finnish President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> whether he felt his hand had been weakened on the eve of the summit. `` I do n't feel weakened,'' he said. Republicans and Democrats on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> welcomed the development. `` Sending <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> off into retirement with a legal golden parachute ... would have been the wrong step at the wrong time,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. The key provisions of the proposed agreement called for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation in August as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> commander, his departure from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and, in exchange, the dismissal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug smuggling indictments against him. The goal was to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from the Panamanian political scene as the country moved toward civilian-led rule with presidential elections in May 1989. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> indicated that the two countries now appear to be back to square one. `` All proposals addressed during these negotiations have been withdrawn,'' he said. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said in a statement that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is a `` fugitive'' and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will use `` every legal means at our disposal to bring him to justice, to remove him from power and to restore democracy to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating plan had drawn considerable bipartisan opposition at home and from anti-Noriega forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as well. Among the critics was Democratic presidential front runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a break with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said he, if elected president, would not negotiate with reputed drug dealers, either domestic and foreign. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved 86-10 a resolution criticizing the proposed dismissal of the drug charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Throughout, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> view was that dismissal of the indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was a small price to pay for his departure from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the restoration of democratic rule. The negotiations reached the do-or-die stage starting on Monday when <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after two days of consultations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Wednesday morning that agreement seemed to be in hand but <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> telephoned the department at 4 p.m. EDT to say that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had rejected the plan. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the administration expects to work with Latin American democracies in hopes of seeking a solution. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will continue to work with the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ... to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' but he offered no details of how that might be accomplished. He refused comment when asked if military solutions are being contemplated. But at the Pentagon, officials insisted there were no plans afoot for direct military intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified, also said the roughly 11,000 American troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had not been placed on any special alert. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> backed away from the proposal when he saw that `` it got him out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and it got him out of power.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to recognize ousted President <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the legitimate leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, rather than President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, the nominal leader approved by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a pro-government newspaper said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military rejected the proposed accord because the plan would not guarantee that <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> remained in power. `` The high command of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> rejected the points of conversation because they found no guarantee of the continuity of the constitutional mandate of President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>,'' said the pro-government afternoon daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION>, citing unidentified sources. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, who obtained the indictment against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said after <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s announcement, `` We are prepared to go forward with the case and we will do so.'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s four <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lawyers, said he believes the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment against his client could well be dismissed. `` I have continued to work on our motion for dismissal of the indictment on legal grounds and we will continue to do so. We still feel that we have a strong case for dismissal on a variety on various grounds,'' <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had planned to accompany <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when he left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday morning for <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> stayed behind to monitor the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation, delaying his departure for <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> until early evening.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> was 19 years old when he first saw <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1965. `` This is paradise,'' he remembers saying as he looked down from an airplane at a pristine beach. `` There ca n't be a war here.'' Some 23 years later, the image of that paradise still haunts him. So do images of the Vietnam War, a conflict he experienced first hand as a member of the battered First Cavalry Division. In `` Walking Point: A Vietnam Voyage,'' now on view at off-Broadway's <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> Theater, <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> tries to reconcile the two memories. His reconciliation forms the core of `` Walking Point,'' a harrowing yet hopeful tale of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> that eloquently tries to explain the hold this strange, wonderous country had _ and still has _ over the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen who fought there. In `` Walking Point,'' <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, founder and artistic director of the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ensemble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, sits alone on stage and talks for some 80 minutes about his visits to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. In the fervent, almost monotone voice of a true believer, he tells the audience about three trips he made to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> after the war ended. <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>'s postwar journeys, including one he made with performance artist and clown <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, become vivid travelogues. He describes a calm, strangely tranquil <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, no longer divided into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. There's a visit to a water puppet show in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, a magical, almost mystical experience that suddenly brings back horrific memories of the war. And there are profiles of various guides and interpreters, men who a few years before were part of the enemy. The juxtaposition of past and present never is far from the surface in any of <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>'s stories. They overlap when <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> travels south to <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> _ he ca n't bring himself to call it <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ to visit places he saw during the war. He finds the city alive and vibrant, full of reminders of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presence that left abruptly more than a decade ago. There are the fading signs in English proclaiming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations. There is the burned hulk of an American tank that sets <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> wondering about who were the soldiers who died in its wreckage. And there are the Amerasian children, the questioning faces of the young who bear the unmistakable imprint of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. What finally makes the evening such a moving and unsettling experience is <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>'s extraordinary feeling for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. It embodies love, hate and just about every emotion in between. But `` Walking Point'' never sinks into despair, even though <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>'s story is melancholy and, at times, painfully sad. Maybe that's because its author wo n't give up. He's a determined storyteller who wo n't stop talking until he understands why it all happened and what have been consequences of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s attempt to save <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> from communism.

 `` The Wonder Years,'' now playing at off-Broadway's Village Gate, may be the first musical built entirely on name and product recognition. Virtually every pop icon and every fad from the 1950s and'60s are mentioned in this mild little revue that examines the baby boom generation from birth to the year 2018, the 50th anniversary of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. They are all here _ from <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Riccardo </PERSON> to Mr. _ and Dr. _ <LOCATION> Spock </LOCATION>; from hula hoops to the <LOCATION> Watusi </LOCATION>; from <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> to Polaroid Swingers. The music and lyrics by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> are as unsurprising as the cast which is headed by the always cheerful <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>. He plays an irritating character named Skippy, billed as the first baby-boom baby, born one minute after midnight on Jan. 1, 1946. At least <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> is enthusiastic. But `` The Wonder Years'' is as bland as the white bread it celebrates.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> on Wednesday proposed slashing programs and reining in spending to woo back the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other ex-members, but ran into opposition from Soviet bloc and Third World nations. The director-general said the 158-nation organization faced `` new challenges that required fresh solutions'' and called for reduction of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>'s 16 major programs to five and of its 60 general programs to 16. Mayor's plan, officially called a sketch to indicate that it could be considerably modified, proposed austerity measures aimed at saving $ 8 million. It called for shorter conferences, reduced travel and controls on document production. The Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization should do fewer things but do them better `` with fewer activities and more follow-up,'' <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> said, adding that the agency had to be `` more visible in order to be more credible.'' Mayor, elected to head <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> in November, outlined the preliminary plan to members of the 51-nation Executive Board at the start their three-week-long spring meeting. On Monday the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> scientist said he was asking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to rejoin <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which paid 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>'s budget, pulled out in 1984 and 1985 to protest the organization's alleged anti-Western bias and squandering of The <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> budget was $ 289.3 million for 1986-87. Mayor had described his proposals as `` provocative'' and likely to stimulate a major debate at <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>. In fact, some members found them so disturbing that the agenda was changed at the last minute so that <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> could present his plan at the opening session instead of Monday of next week as scheduled. The Group of 77 Third World countries circulated a paper sharply critical of the plan, which they said treated them as `` objects for whose benefits activities have been proposed rather than as actors and equal partners.'' It said the proposals do not reflect the wishes of the member states and should be re-drafted and presented at the board's 1989 spring meeting. Another indication of the tough sledding Mayor's plan will face came from Indian delegate <PERSON> Swaran </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. He said the document contained contradictions and that it dealt in terms of concepts and not real problems and played down the role of governments. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> called for restoration of one of the dropped programs that deals with peace and development, and the struggle for human rights and against discrimination. Polish delegate <PERSON> Kazimiierz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zygulski </PERSON> said there was an `` obsession with change and efficiency'' in Mayor's proposals. `` We ca n't be just a pragmatic organization, we have to have specific goals,'' he said. In opening the meeting, Board President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> praised the `` orginality, freshness and broadness of view'' in Mayor's proposals. Mayor said the agency should concentrate on five major areas: education, natural science, culture, communications and social science. He has promised to consult intellectuals, artists, scientists, educators and journalists before preparing a final version of the plan. During his presentation, <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> made no reference to <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>'s controversial plan to establish a new world information and communication order, which has been sharply criticized by Western governments and news media organizations In speeches to media professionals last week in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> said he favored a `` new phase'' at <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> that would allow a `` free and uninhibited flow of information.''

<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gunmen thought to be Sikh radicals killed eight people in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> on Wednesday, Indian news agencies reported. The shootings occurred in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ropar </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and raised to at least 1,171 the number of people killed by extremists in the northern Indian state since the year began. The toll for all of 1987 was 1,030 killed. Police meanwhile reported that municipal workers recovered human skeletons Wednesday from <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, the Golden Temple. The <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> city police superintendent, <PERSON> Baldev </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, said two skeletons, of a man and a woman, were pulled from under the debris inside the temple complex by city laborers. `` These are the remains of people tortured and then killed by Sikh terrorists,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are more such skeletons, we are trying to bring them out.'' Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since 1982. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said the radicals often tortured people they suspected to be police informers. Police and paramilitary forces surround the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, where a 10-day siege ended last week after militants inside were forced to surrender. The temple was opened to the public for the first time Monday. Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million population but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Hindus account for more than 80 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population

 Aldermen in the nation's third-largest city approved an ordinance Wednesday that sponsors said would bar smoking in most public areas and force restaurant owners and employers to set aside smoking sections. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the first and second-largest cities, already have smoking restrictions. `` Those of you who want to die _ do it yourselves,'' declared <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON>, one of 33 <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members who voted for the ordinance. Eight voted against it. `` Law enforcement officials would be better placed trying to chase criminals than smokers,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> in speaking against the ordinance, whose quick passage surprised even some supporters. Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, a smoker, favors the ban, said aide <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` We thought the vote was going to be closer, and he was prepared to break the tie and vote for it. The mayor smokes, but he has cut back dramatically. He never smokes in public,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. The ordinance bans smoking entirely in enclosed public areas like meeting rooms and taxicabs and requires restaurants with 40 seats or more to set aside smoking and non-smoking areas, said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, the ordinance's main sponsor. He said the amount of designated restaurant space would be based on the percentage of smoking and non-smoking clientele. Bars and private meeting rooms would be exempt from the ban. In addition, <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> said, employers must designate smoking and no-smoking areas if workers request them. No-smoking signs must be posted in all designated areas, he said. The ordinance, which takes effect in 60 days, carries fines ranging from $ 25 to $ 100. `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has to line up with the rest of the major cities. We have been lagging,'' <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> said. A state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee blocked legislation in late April to restrict smoking in most public places in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, even though the proposal had been watered down to appease business groups. Similar legislation has been introduced annually in recent years without success. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' smoking ban, the city's fifth anti-smoking legislation since 1964, went into effect in January. It bans smoking in indoor sports arenas, concert halls, stores not specializing in tobacco products, transportation terminals, day care centers and most private schools. Restaurants seating more than 50 would be required to reserve more than half their seats for non-smokers. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s anti-smoking law, one of the toughest in the nation, went into effect last month. Although small establishments are exempt, the bill forbids smoking inside sports arenas, theaters, banks, hospitals and taxis. It limits smoking in offices, restaurants and hotel lobbies. Smoking has been limited in all city buildings since June 1986. When the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> legislation passed, health officials said about 150 cities had enacted some kind of smoking restriction legislation.

<HEAD>U.S. Government Opens Another Front in Oranges Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Wednesday opened another front in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to boost sales of American oranges and orange juice in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> announced that he has accepted a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus industry petition for a formal investigation of Japanese restrictions on orange and juice imports as unfair trade practices. The restrictions include import quotas and a requirement that imported juice be blended with home-grown juice. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s office already is pursuing the orange dispute at other levels. After months of unsuccessful negotiations with the Japanese government, it moved earlier this month to have the Japanese orange import quotas _ along with those on beef imports _ declared illegal under international trading rules by <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Any of the cases could culminate in formal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation against Japanese products or official demands for compensation for lost sales. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said in a statement the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already `` is aggressively moving on two different fronts ... to resolve the citrus and beef disputes'' with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` In the coming weeks we will vigorously pursue our <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> case,'' he said, while at the same time making additional efforts to resolve the dispute directly with <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation has been meeting with Japanese agriculture ministry officials. `` If those efforts do not lead to a satisfactory resolution of the matter, or if <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> obstructs the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> process, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> could retaliate against any violation by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of its <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> obligations, or any unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory Japanese government practice that limits access to its citrus market,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> added. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus industry, which petitioned May 6 to get the Japanese restrictions declared unfair, contends that lifting them would cut by one-third the prices Japanese consumers must pay for oranges, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> noted. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s office had 45 days to decide whether to accept the industry petition for an investigation but it took only 19 days. If the office finds that unfair practices do exist and the dispute can not be resolved through negotiations or the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> machinery, it recommends action to the president. The petition was filed under Section 301 of the 1974 trade act which also authorizes investigations on the government's own initiative. Organizations joining in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> petition were the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> and the Indian River Citrus League. Elimination of the barriers, they said, could boost annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to 300,000 metric tons, compared with 1987 sales of 126,000 tons of fresh oranges and 8,500 tons of juice. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> buys more American farm products than any other country but disagreement continued in still another foodstuff trade conflict. Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Hirohumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueno </PERSON> ended two days of talks with <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s office Wednesday without formally announced results on implementation of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> findings earlier this year that Japanese import quotas on 10 varieties of canned or processed foods were illegal. The Japanese Embassy said <PERSON> Ueno </PERSON> would return to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the talks would continue at a date not yet fixed. During the exchange, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side demanded total removal of the quotas within two years while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> proposed a slower liberalization program, the embassy indicated, without giving specific details. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side also urged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> against measures that could nullify removal of the quotas, such as import surcharges, the embassy said. There was no immediate comment from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side, led by <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON>, assistant trade representative for agriculture. Affected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports include preserved, concentrated or sweetened milk and cream, processed cheese, preserved beef and pork, fruit purees, pastes, pulps and juices, tomato ketchup and sauce, starch, sugar, dried leguminous vegetables and ground nuts.

 Leaders of the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels arrived in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> late Wednesday for a new round of talks with the leftist government on reaching a permanent cease-fire in the 6-year-old war. The negotiations were expected to begin Thursday. One group of negotiators for the rebels, known as Contras, arrived in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. `` We come with great political will so that a permanent solution will be arrived at to -LRB- resolve -RRB- the situation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> told the Sandinista government's <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> radio station A few hours later, Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, the rebel military leader, arrived on a private plane from the Honduran capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. He was accompanied by <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, head of the rebel delegation, and other Contra officials. The two dozen rebel delegates went immediately to the Camino Real Hotel near the international airport on the outskirts of the capital. <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said the first known visit of <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> during the war underlines the Contras' `` political will to search for a Nicaraguan solution to the war.'' Contra leaders initially refused to return to the capital, complaining that their movements were restricted in two previous sessions this year. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, said representatives of the Contra umbrella organization were going to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> `` with the understanding that there will be complete and unrestricted freedom of expression and the free right to meet with organizations and leaders.'' He spoke by telephone with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. The government said Tuesday it would allow the rebels to meet with the most important opposition group in the country, the Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, and to visit the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops' conference, the opposition daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and relatives. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> rejected Contra demands the talks take place in the border post of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, where the two sides agreed to the 60-day truce scheduled to expire May 30. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, an aide to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the rebels planned to offer to lay down their arms on Sept. 1. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said on Monday he was unilaterally extending the temporary truce for an additional 30 days. Rebel leaders have rejected extensions of the truce, but members of the political directorate said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> they would not break the truce even after May 30. A major obstacle to agreement has been the issue of delivery of non-lethal aid to the rebels gathered in cease-fire zones inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Under the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> agreement, the aid was to come through a neutral international organization. Contras insisted in the talks that they had the right to choose the organization. Contra leaders were quoted as saying they would accept a proposal for delivery of humanitarian aid to their forces inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by an agency with ties to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the rebels would propose a timetable for political changes that include a free and fair electoral system, an independent judiciary with the power to guarantee human rights, removal of the military from <LOCATION> Sandinista </LOCATION> party control, and guaranteed property rights. The pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the government sent the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> a bill providing for direct elections of city councils in Nicaraguan municipalities, includng <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, late this year or early next year. Mayors, who now are named by the executive branch, would be chosen from the city councils, it said. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, an assembly spokeswoman, said the bill was not yet available to the news media. The constitution provides for election of municipal governments through `` direct, free and secret'' balloting. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> says the war has killed 26,500 people and caused $ 3 billion in damage to the economy.

 Medical tests showed former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> did not suffer a heart attack, and the Philippine consul Wednesday accused the hospitalized <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of faking chest pains to gain sympathy in his homeland. `` I think these are charades, these chest pains are not substantiated medically,'' <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, the consul here, said. `` We are faced with a master manipulator.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' physician, Dr. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pang </PERSON>, ruled out a heart attack as the cause of the discomfort and ordered <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to undergo tests Thursday for a possible lung ailment, said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman Gemmo <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>. `` He's in high spirits, but will have to have additional tests to determine the cause of the pain,'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 70, was listed in guarded condition Wednesday in the intensive care unit after being admitted Tuesday night, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshina </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> began suffering chest pains Tuesday before an hour-long interview with <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> newspaper group, according to <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' chief spokesman. After consulting his personal physician, Dr. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pang </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was admitted to the hospital, <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> admitted during the interview that his health was poor, a rare statement for the former president who has often denied earlier reports of ill health. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' hospitalization was a ploy to gain support in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for his bid to return home. `` He went to the hospital voluntarily, under his own steam,'' <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said. `` We know what he's up to.'' The hospital would release no specific information about <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' condition except that he would be hospitalized at least until Thursday <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> would not speculate on whether <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would be allowed to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, but, in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, several politicians said he should be allowed to come home. `` This is going to create another problem if -LRB- <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> -RRB- comes home in a box,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>. `` Now is the time for the government to act and allow him to return.'' Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return for the funeral of his mother, who died May 4 and awaits burial. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> poses a threat to national security. The hospital's intensive care unit section was guarded closely by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> security guards, who also manned every entrance to the hospital. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, spent most of the night with her husband, according to spokesman <PERSON> Gemmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON>, but she made no statement to the news media. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife have lived here since fleeing the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> during the February 1986 civilian-military revolution toppled him after 20 years in power.

 <PERSON> Placido </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> led <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Metropolitan Opera to a thunderous welcome from <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> fans Wednesday as the Met opened its <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> tour with <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> in the leading role in `` The Tales of <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>.'' The Spanish tenor's impassioned interpretation of a poet who relates three love fantasies, one each act brought him eight curtain calls and roaring approval from an audience that included Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, his wife Princess <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> and son <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiro </PERSON>. With `` Hoffman,'' the Met began its second tour of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and only its fourth tour outside <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` The Marriage of <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>,'' featuring sopranos <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> <PERSON> Hei-kyung </PERSON> as <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON> and bass-baritone <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON> as <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>, opens Friday. The Met is also performing <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Il Travatore.'' Wednesday's four-hour performance in the 3,450-seat NHK Hall was punctuated by applause and shouts of approval after each aria, duet or trio. By the fourth curtain call, most of the audience was on its feet. Applause continued for 11 minutes after the final curtain. Hundreds in the audience surged toward the front of the stage, tossing small bouquets to the 47-year-old <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Erie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupuy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s three loves. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> picked up the flowers, handing some to the three female singers and tossing some to the orchestra pit and the audience. The audience also applauded wildly for bass <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who lustily sang four roles throughout the three acts and prologue and epilogue, and artistic director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, who conducted the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. Joining the imperial family on opening night were business and cultural luminaries, including the <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Akio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>; novelist <PERSON> Yukiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> and veteran actor <PERSON> Osamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Takizawa </PERSON>. `` Domingo's high notes really extended far. He was lovely,'' said Miss <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>. `` As a writer, I think the story of ` <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>' is captivating, and that's why I particularly wanted to see it.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> company's performance `` was wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Takizawa </PERSON>, 81. `` ` <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>' is probably the best known opera in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but I've seen it done by other troupes. This is my first time to see the Met, and I'm delighted.'' For opera devotees who did n't understand the French lyrics, a Japanese translation was projected onto a narrow screen above the stage. `` If you knew the story slightly, you did n't need to read the screen,'' Miss <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> said. `` In fact I think it's better not to.'' While the cheers were clearly heartfelt, the promoter, <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, did what it could to encourage them. In a series of three newsletters sent to those who had purchased advance tickets, opera lovers were urged to add to the crescendo of bravos _ and not to boo.

 A flight mechanic stole a private Learjet from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on Wednesday and took it on a 1,600-mile joyride to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where he killed himself as authorities approached the plane, officials said. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>, 24, who was not a licensed pilot, was found dead at the controls of the twin-engine plane, a Learjet 36a, moments after a pilot he knew talked him through a relatively routine landing at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 5:18 a.m., authorities said. The pilot, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, said he was not nervous in talking <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> down, `` because I was confident he was going to listen to me.'' Police, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and emergency personnel were waiting at the edge of the runway with their lights off when <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> landed the plane, five hours after stealing the 10-seat plane from <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, worked as a flight mechanic at the airport for <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which owned the plane and operates the world's largest fleet of Learjets, officials said `` As the crash crew and law enforcement personnel approached, he was ordered to lock his brakes,'' said <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>. `` They heard a noise and when they looked in the cockpit, they found him dead. Things happened really fast.'' Denver <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schussler </PERSON> said the agency knew little about <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, would only confirm he had been employed there. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> made 30 calls to the apartment complex where he lived and found only one resident at home. She said she never had heard of him. Authorities said they do not know why <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>, who was alone in the plane, killed himself or where he got the gun. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> were investigating. No motive for the plane theft was given, although <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON> said, `` The indication was that he just wanted to fly around for awhile.'' `` This guy obviously was a proficient pilot,'' said <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>. `` He made a good landing right in the middle of the runway with no damage to the plane or the runway. The very fact that he got off the ground shows that he knew something.'' <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Daikos </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> airport, said <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> did not have a pilot's license and had been employed with Flight International since March. As the plane was taking off around 2:15 a.m. EDT, it clipped a security guard's van on a runway, shearing off part of a wingtip fuel tank and damaging the driver's side of the van, said <PERSON> Daikos </PERSON>. The guard escaped injury because he had gotten out of the van moments earlier, <PERSON> Daikos </PERSON> said. The plane apparently was airborne for the next five hours, although <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> said they did not know <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>'s whereabouts until he was detected over western <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. Controllers at several airports had tracked the plane during parts of its flight, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>, senior <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> official at the <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> tower, said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> contacted <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION> and asked whether a Learjet pilot was available to help <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> land the plane. In the meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rerouted some flights along <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>'s projected flight path, and <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> officials cleared runways. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> pilot, talked <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> through the landing. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> played a 19-minute tape recording of their conversation, which dealt exclusively with altitude, airspeed and other technical adjustments <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> was asked to make before setting the plane down. In a news conference Wednesday evening, he said he quickly recognized the voice on the radio as <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>, a former employee of his own company whom he recalled as a `` very personable man.'' `` He did his job well. I never had any problems with him,'' he said, adding that he did not find out that <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> had committed suicide until 10 minutes after the landing. `` I was shocked to get that news, and I though it was very tragic,'' he said. After <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> landed, <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> asked, `` Are you OK, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>? <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, are you OK? Have you got that thing shut down yet?'' There was no reply, and <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON> said <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> was found dead moments later. <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a spokesman for Learjet in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, said the Learjet 36a has a range of 2,568 miles and a cruising speed of over 500 mph. A standard-equipped model, which sells for $ 4.25 million, seats 10 passengers and a crew of two.

 After six years and a dozen Emmy Awards, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s unconventional hospital show `` St Elsewhere'' left the air Wednesday night after a final scene that may have perplexed many viewers. In a maniacal twist on the `` it-was-all-a-dream'' plot that `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' made famous, the final scene revealed that the entire series had never existed, except in the mind of the autistic son of one of the doctors, <PERSON> Westphall </PERSON>. Up until the surprise ending, the final episode, titled `` The Last One,'' seemed a basic end-of-series sendoff. In view of the show's irreverent philosophy, perhaps it was, in fact, an obscure satire on final episodes. `` I expect a very mixed reaction -LRB- to the ending -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Paltrow </PERSON>, one of the show's executive producers. `` I think some people will think it's extraordinary and existential and quintessential ` St. Elsewhere.' I think other people will find it puzzling, odd, maybe unfulfilling in some way. I think we'll get a broad range of responses, those being the poles.'' When it made its debut six season ago, the show was part of a wave of creativity, mainly from <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, that revolutionized stodgy network programming in the 1980s. `` St. Elsewhere'' followed the <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> series `` Hill Street Blues'' onto <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and was inevitably compared to the earlier show's groundbreaking style _ quick cuts, subplots, overlapping dialogue and hand-held cameras. But `` St. Elsewhere'' went beyond `` Hill Street,'' a police show, in social satire, even making fun of its own network and previous <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> shows. The `` St. Elsewhere'' writers had wanted to go all out in the final episode, but prohibitive costs kept their script, a futuristic view of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eligius </LOCATION> hospital at the edge of apocalypse, from being filmed. Set in the year 2013, it depicted the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eligius </LOCATION> doctors, as well as some now-practicing offspring, waiting for a huge cloud of toxic gas released in a war between `` <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` Corporate <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The script revealed that <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> are the only two TV networks of the future, and that <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> will become a major cultural figure. In the end, prohibitive costs knocked down not only the intended final episode but the show itself. `` St. Elsewhere'' was produced at a loss by <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> at a time when hour-long series are not selling well in syndication. The show has been sold in syndication, though <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> will release no details. In an apparently personal, inside joke in the dialogue of the final script, Dr. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiscus </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Howie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandel </PERSON> -RRB-, says of his years at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eligius </LOCATION>, `` Grueling hours, bad food, egomania, death and moral confusion. It'll be hard to leave.'' The producers of the show have long since left and are busy on a new series for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Tattinger's,'' an offbeat romantic comedy set in a popular <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> restaurant. It is being shot on location here and stars <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> <PERSON> Danner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiller </PERSON>. The show is on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s fall schedule in the same time period that `` St. Elsewhere'' is leaving.

 Honduran soldiers battled leftist Salvadoran guerrillas near the border between the two countries, leaving 17 rebels dead and three soldiers seriously wounded, military sources said Wednesday. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the fighting occurred early Tuesday on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Marcala </LOCATION>, about 90 miles northwest of the Honduran capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> and 40 miles from the Salvadoran border. Since the incident, Honduran air force helicopters have flown over the area to discourage further fighting, the sources said. No further details were available. On Saturday, the armed forces said there were intelligence reports that guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> were planning to carry out terrorist actions in an effort to destabilize <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, a strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The front, made up of five guerrilla armies, has been fighting the U.S.-supported government in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for more than eight years. The armed forces said a rebel unit entered <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> late last week to try to take advantage of anti-American sentiment stirred by the arrest and deportation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, a suspected drug trafficker. The Honduran Constitution forbids the extradition of Honduran citizens. In early April, demonstrators burned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>.

 Firefighters opened a vent on a blazing, overturned propane tanker Wednesday to try to speed up the burning of a fire that closed two highways and a commuter rail line for a second day, officials said. Some 500 families remained evacuated Wednesday, police said. A vent atop the truck, normally used to let air out as the tanker is filled, was opened on the firefighters' third attempt to increase the flow of fuel without setting off an explosion. Officials said they could n't predict how long the fire would burn because they did n't know how large the rupture was or how much opening the valve helped. The blaze started when the tanker overturned at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. Fire Chief <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhner </PERSON> said earlier Wednesday although the `` accelerated burn'' method was risky, it was no riskier than letting the blaze continue. The 2,500-gallon tank could have burned up to eight days if the flow had not been increased, he said. The Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway and the Sunrise Highway remained closed for a second day, forcing thousands of motorists to find alternate routes to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> said 30,000 rail commuters were directly affected by the closing of several stations on a branch line, although extra trains were added to the main line. The threat of an explosion caused officials to evacuate homes within a half-mile radius around the tanker, said <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Executive <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulotta </PERSON>. Police said 500 households were affected, revising Tuesday's figure of 2,000 families. About 300 evacuees spent the night at <ORGANIZATION> Seaford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Firefighters kept firetrucks spewing water on the fire to control it even as they tried to open valves to increase the propane flow. The first valve attempted was found to be melted shut. They then tried to install a `` belly valve'' that would allow a controlled flow, but that also failed. Finally, in late afternoon they opened the vent and hoped propane would trickle out. Fire communications supervisor <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said the fire marshal's office and hazardous materials experts were at the scene, and ambulances were standing by in case of an explosion. <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Krausch </PERSON> said the truck _ owned by <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> _ overturned on the expressway Tuesday morning when the driver experienced a problem with the truck's rear wheels. The driver, identified by police as <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Vai </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Westbury </LOCATION>, and a passenger escaped before the truck ignited. <PERSON> Vai </PERSON>, who was treated at the scene for a shoulder cut, was arrested on an outstanding traffic offense and was charged with driving with a suspended license and failure to produce a license. He was released on $ 100 bail. Propane such as that carried on the truck meets a variety of residential and commercial energy needs, particularly in areas not served by natural gas.

 Doctors reported finding the first tentative evidence that chemotherapy may be able to help control lung cancer, the nation's leading cancer killer. Four studies presented at a medical conference produce at least a hint that platinum-based drugs, combined with radiation and sometimes surgery, may help prolong patients' survival. None of the research suggests anything close to a cure for lung cancer, but doctors are encouraged by any improvement in a disease in which survival is measured in months, rather than years.

 Cable viewers can catch a couple of hot stars from the big screen in a new HBO movie: <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkin </PERSON> from `` The Big Easy'' and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who went from virtual unknown to star of a box-office smash, `` The Untouchables.'' In `` <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> plays a down-on-his-luck smuggler of exotic birds who gets mixed up in a plot to run guns for the Contras. The movie premieres Saturday. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, but his family fled as political refugees in 1961 and settled in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON>'' was shot on location in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` I've been here -LRB- <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> -RRB- for 10 years, but I still like <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> better because of the weather,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` It's closer to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. The downfall for me -LRB- here -RRB- is the smog. I like the feeling of tropical weather. I like a tropical night with the breeze off the ocean. The <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> is in my blood. `` I was only 5 when I left <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, so I'm obsessed with it. I've built my own memory of it that's greater than what it was. `` <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON>'' also stars 1988 Oscar nominee <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> -LRB- `` Street Smart'' -RRB- as a slick <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lawyer who is part of the scheme to raise money for the Contras. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON>, a small-time smuggler who is quitting the business when he discovers that his lawyer-brother has been murdered. A key to the murder is a cassette tape, which he finds in a woman's purse. The purse belongs to <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, a high-class hooker with a baby and a dream of living an idyllic life in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The two are quickly swept up and find themselves in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> _ in a lot of trouble. `` The key for me was that <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatzberg </PERSON> was directing,'' said <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. `` He'd directed ` Scarecrow' and ` Panic in Needle Park.' I met him in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and when he told me he was talking to <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, that was the icing on the cake.'' The Costa Rican scenes were shot on a 30-acre estate in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. `` It was filled with monkeys and they became quite a sound problem,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` Every morning the owners would come out on the balcony and feed them. Some became quite aggressive, and one day they attacked the person I was sitting with.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> also recently co-starred in `` Stand and Deliver,'' a true story about a crusading teacher, played by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>. He said another reason he liked the role of <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> was the chance to play a non-minority character. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> is from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. `` I've played a lot of ethnic characers, using Spanish or Italian,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>'s life was in limbo. He'd been an athlete. I could tell he was in the line of business he was in and spending his time in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to alienate himself from the baseball world. It was painful, he wanted to be a loner. In <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON>, he found a woman going through the same alienation. `` I was a jock myself, except for me it was basketball. But that did n't pan out and I was in limbo. My interest in the arts sort of took over. After my first college play, it sort of took over. I think there's a geat parallel between sports and acting, especially basketball, which is very spontaneous. You have the thrill of the unknown.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s other credits include `` Eight Million Ways To Die'' and `` The Mean Season.'' His next film is `` The Sixth Family,'' which will be filmed in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON>. But shooting has been delayed by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> strike. After `` The Untouchables,'' in which he played <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, one of the agents recruited by <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON>, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for a small film called `` American Roulette.'' `` You ca n't imagine the ramifications of a successful film like ` The Untouchables,''' he said. `` It helps you get more work. Your choices are enhanced. I know actors who go their whole lives without a successful film.''

Called a child-to-child `` crayon brigade,'' about 40,000 cards have been received by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> for relay to children of Soviet church members. The cards are being carried personally in batches by church groups visiting Soviet churches this year. Groups went in April and May and others go in July, August, September and October. Additionally, many Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox leaders from this country and elsewhere are to be there for special celebrations June 5-16. But it was the outpouring of fond, joyful artwork by children in more than 3,000 Sunday school classes in about 60 denominations that provided the sentimental touch. `` It was an overflowing of children's naturalness,'' says <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Episcopalian who originated the project, asking churches across the country to send cards made by youngsters. She says some include photos of themselves and families, and adds, `` These are really meaningful. They're personalized, so the receiving Soviet child can say, ` See, my <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> friend has brown hair.''' Many of the cards, which have come from children in all 50 states, are decorated with crosses, hearts, flags, birthday cakes, balloons, trees, flowers and smiling faces. Besides wishing `` happy birthday,'' many cards include expressions of affection and cheering hopes. There also are typical childish misspellings, such as `` Habbi l000'' and `` prays the Lord.'' `` We want to be friends with our brothers and sisters in Christ in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> and we send these handmade birthday cards as tokens of friendship,'' wrote the treacher of a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Sunday school class. When some of the cards were being distributed to Soviet children at a church in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, `` mothers had tears in their eyes,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindner </PERSON>, who led a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour group there in April. The cards range from simple to elaborate, many with words and pictures in crayon colors, others done with magic markers or watercolors. Some children sent posters decorated by the whole class, others cloth banners. Ms. <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON> says the project `` breaks down hate'' and `` lessens fear'' between <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children and `` helps us to see our mutual Christianity. `` So much of the hate on both sides is manufactured, and our children are afraid. Each child that sits and scribbles away will feel less threatened.'' The overwhelming response to the project was generated in part by an article about it in the March 1988 issue of Guideposts, an interdenominational magazine published by the Rev. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Peale </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, coordinator of the ecumenical travel seminars to the Soviet, says the response has been a `` touching and dramatic demonstration of an openness to and interest in Soviet Christians. `` The cards are, for the most part, coming from ordinary Christians all over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, in fact from the people most often thought of as patriotic and anti-Soviet. `` This flow of good will toward their brothers and sisters in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> shows the strong desire on the part of many Americans to get involved and to know each other better.''

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the reform-minded son of a southern Russian peasant, is redefining what the world expects from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and from the man who leads it. This 57-year-old law school graduate and career communist has turned a half-century of Soviet economic orthodoxy on its head by praising individual enterprise and profitability, and relaxing bureaucratic controls on managers and workers alike. Unlike his predecessors, this <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader preaches his reformist brand of socialism with a mix of fiery conviction and Madison Avenue flare. Whether he is facing foreign journalists questioning him about human rights, bantering with peasants on a collective farm or inviting American schoolchildren to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seems at home with himself and his role as general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He says he seeks a new working relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the West that will decrease global tensions and allow the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to turn more resources from the military sector to developing the country's stagnant civilian economy. When he greets President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Sunday for their fourth summit meeting, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be hoping to further his own domestic agenda as well as foreign policy goals, such as a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear arms. Soviet foreign policy, he has said, `` is more than ever determined by domestic policy, by our interest in concentrating on constructive endeavors to improve our country. This is why we need lasting peace, predictability and constructiveness in international relations.'' Since March 1985, when he became Soviet leader, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s achievements in the foreign policy field have been far more tangible than progress in the titanic task he has set for himself in reviving his country's economy and modernizing its social structure At the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed a treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles, the first superpower pact in history that mandates the scrapping of an entire category of weapons. On May 15, the first units of a Soviet force estimated at 115,000 troops returned home from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviet military intervention in support of a socialist regime in that neighboring country had been an irritant in U.S.-Soviet relations for more than eight years. At home, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is pursuing reforms that dismantle much of the top-heavy bureaucracy that has micromanaged the Soviet economy since the reign of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. This renunciation of long-standing socialist orthodoxy, plus the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s `` glasnost'' campaign for more openness and criticism, has left many Soviets bewildered. `` Some people have indeed lost their bearings amid all these processes under way,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged earlier this month. `` Some people have failed to keep their heads and panicked.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can be charming or tough, philosophical or down-to-earth, solemn or jovial. But his message to his countrymen is usually the same: The country must modernize quickly and work harder, or it will squander the gains of 70 years of socialism. `` The reorganization which we have launched ... this is where we want to direct our resources, this is where our thoughts are going, these are our actual programs and intentions, on this we intend to spend the intellectual energy of our society,'' he has said. In November, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proved his toughness by firing <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a former protege who criticized the slow pace of the reforms at a closed meeting of the party leadership. But rather than thrust <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> into the utter obscurity usually reserved for fallen officials, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has appointed him to a high post in the housing bureacracy. When widespread demonstrations broke out in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> in February calling for the annexation of a part of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> temporarily defused ethnic tensions by issuing an unprecedented personal appeal for calm. In late June, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to use a special nationwide party conference, the first since 1941, to set his stamp even more firmly on the party by ousting communists who oppose or are indifferent to his drive for `` perestroika,'' or economic and social restructuring. Like most of his predecessors, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rose to the Kremlin from humble origins. Born March 2, 1931, to a peasant family in the farming region of <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> between the Black and Caspian seas, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> started work as a laborer on a tractor station when he was 15. Little is known about his early years or his life during the Nazi occupation of southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> during World War II. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s mother still reportedly lives in the village of <LOCATION> Privolnoye </LOCATION> where he was born In 1950, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was among the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Komsomol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> chosen because of academic ability and working-class origins to study at the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. It was there he met <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Titorenko </PERSON>, an auburn-haired student from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> whom he married in 1954, and whose glamor and wit would later help him give the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a new image abroad. In 1955, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> graduated with a law degree and he returned to his native <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> region to begin a succession of <LOCATION> Komsomol </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> jobs. In 1970, at age 39, he was named party first secretary in the grain-growing region, becoming <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s viceroy in an area the size of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> In 1979, under then-President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was brought to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to take charge of the nation's problem-plagued farm sector. His inability to produce any visible improvement in food supplies had no apparent effect on his party standing. Once in the Soviet capital, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> quickly widened his influence, becoming a candidate member on the ruling Politburo in 1979 and a full, voting member the next year. After the death in 1984 of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>, who was believed to be grooming <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for top-level responsibilities, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reportedly acquiesced in the choice of <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> for the Soviet leadership. But by the time the ailing <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> died in March 1985, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had been dubbed the party's `` second secretary'' by a Soviet editor and was running meetings of the ruling Politburo. Within hours of <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>'s passing, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was named party general secretary, becoming, at age 54, the youngest <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader since <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. In his first months in power, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> moved quickly to chart a program of economic modernization, decreed an anti-drinking campaign, proclaimed the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s desire to scrap all nuclear weapons by the year 2000 and had to deal with history's worst nuclear power accident when an explosion and fire ruptured a reactor at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> power plant in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> in April 1986.

<HEAD>Delta Yields Traces of Another Ancient Mexican Civilization</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Deep in a mangrove swamp near the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be another ancient Mexican civilization. So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four-ton stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a 19-inch-high clay figure of a fertility-rite priest. `` But,'' says <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Capitaine </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Xalapa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthropology </ORGANIZATION>, `` the finds are so promising that the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> state in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>.'' The stele was found in November 1986. It is covered with inscriptions in an unknown language but with some Mayan numerals. The priest in the clay figure is wearing the human skin of a flayed sacrificial victim. Both are about 1,800 years old. `` That would place them in the second century A.D., which is after the archaeological Olmecs, who flourished in the area from around 1050 to 500 B.C., and before the Mayas who emerged around the fourth century A.D,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said in an interview. Adding to the intrigue, the <ORGANIZATION> Mayas </ORGANIZATION> lived in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, more than 700 miles to the east, <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said at the museum in <LOCATION> Xalapa </LOCATION>, where the stele and figure are kept. `` But there are two dates on the stele in Mayan writing, in their so-called Long Count Calendar made up of dots and bars, equivalent to May 22, 143 -LRB- A.D. -RRB-, and July 13, 156 A.D.,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. If the mysterious people did exist, <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said, they also appeared to be unrelated to the other two of the four known civilizations that inhabited the gulf coast: the Totonacas, who emerged around the seventh century A.D. in the area where the artifacts were found, or the Huaxtecas farther north, about one century later. `` They could be the Xicalancas, of which <PERSON> Clavijero </PERSON> briefly talked about,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said, referring to the Rev. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Clavijero </PERSON> -LRB- 1731-1787 -RRB-, a Jesuit priest who was the first to systematically study <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s ancient languages and peoples. In his `` History of Ancient <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' Clavijero in three lines briefly mentioned the Xicalanca civilization in relation to the Olmecs, but did not go into details. In `` nahuatl,'' the trading language of the <ORGANIZATION> Aztecs </ORGANIZATION>, who came much later, <LOCATION> Xicalanca </LOCATION> means `` the people who live by the Great Body of Salt Water,'' as the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was called. The two artifacts were found within 130 feet of each other in the village of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mojarra </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Piojo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> meets the <LOCATION> Acula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The crocodile-infested region is so swampy that it can be reached only by boat, <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. La Mojarra, with a population of fewer than 200, is up the <LOCATION> Acula </LOCATION> about 20 miles south of the port of <LOCATION> Alvarado </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> state. But neither the village nor the <LOCATION> Piojo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> can be found on any map of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Carved in relief on the previously polished stele, which is of basalt, one of the world's hardest rocks, is the full length profile of a regal figure, a man about 25 years old, holding out in both hands a vessel in a gesture of offering. `` He was probably a ruler, or a chief warrior, or a high priest _ or maybe all three since that was the custom in the gulf region in ancient times,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. The figure wears ear-stops, a tall headdress adorned with four representations of something like a rain god, trimmed with eight feathers, and a breastplate full of other allegorical figures over what appears to be a pleated cotton shirt or tunic. A total of 577 glyphs, or picture-words, divided into 21 neat rows running from top to bottom, plus 33 `` elements'' like the rain-god representations, cover the rest of the slab. `` It was all carved during one continuous period,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. `` It was a single piece of work. It is the oldest and richest piece of writing found yet about this area of ancient <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' About 7 feet tall, slightly oblong and with a gently rounded top, the stele once stood on the right bank of the <LOCATION> Acula </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mojarra </LOCATION>. Over the years, erosion toppled it, and it lay in the river until a fisherman discovered it and dragged it out with the help of villagers. Archaeologists retrieved the stele, but <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said he kept the find quiet for two years so work could proceed `` without the pressure that such a discovery creates.'' The second piece, the ceramic figure of a priest made with the region's thick orange clay, has a square base. It is the only one of two artifacts from that area with a base. The other, also in the museum, is so badly damaged it can not be studied, <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. In the La Mojarra figure, only the head is missing. That type of clay figure was very popular among the four gulf cultures. The Aztecs called it in <LOCATION> Xipe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Totec </LOCATION>, or the Lord of the Flayed, and it was variously worshiped as the god of spring, of fertility, of abundance and of the metalworkers. A peasant at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mojarra </LOCATION> found the shattered figure many years ago while digging the foundations for his house and kept the pieces in a cardboard box. `` We got wind of it three weeks ago, and we convinced him to let the museum have it,'' <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> suspects the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mojarra </LOCATION> area could have been a ceremonial site. `` If so, there surely must be more stele and artifacts to be found,'' he said.

 Political disorders, ethnic tensions, poverty and international disputes are churning up the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seas </LOCATION> in an arc curving sharply northward from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and back down to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, even <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> themselves, have had a taste of trouble in the past year. Most recently it was rioting in <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> over land claims, and in the French territory of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> 19 native Kanaks were killed in a shootout with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> troops in ethnic and political disorders. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> has seen two coups in the past year, and the former British island remains unstable in the aftermath. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is concerned about what it sees as the speading influence of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> in the area and the inroads made by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in what long has been seen as an `` American lake.'' A commentator in the <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the image of a South Seas paradise may have been permanently tarnished. The past year also has seen riots in <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION> and political upheaval in <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> over the alleged corruption of Cabinet ministers. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> faces racial unrest as indigenous Maoris press the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government of Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> with a battery of land and fisheries claims. In <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, aborigines are using this year's bicentennial celebrations to highlight grievances they say grew out of European settlement 200 years ago. In early May, bloody violence erupted over territorial and French presidential elections in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, culminating in the rescue of French hostages held in caves by Melanesian separatists; 21 people were killed. On May 16, a drunken mob ran riot through <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vila </LOCATION>, looting shops and smashing office windows. One man died, nine others were injured and police arrested 30 people in the rioting over land claims. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> responded to the crisis by airlifting riot-control gear to <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> at Prime Minister <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lini </PERSON>'s request Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> linked <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to the rioting and said <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> could not stand by as a friendly country's government is undermined by what he called a non-democratic process. `` There is no doubt about a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> connection in <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. `` In a city with a population of less than 20,000 it is clear that these disturbances have been on a very serious scale.'' <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>, formerly the <LOCATION> British-French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hebrides </LOCATION>, shocked the generally pro-Western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> with its decision in 1986 to establish diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Since then, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has sought fishing agreements with <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> and impoverished <LOCATION> Kiribati </LOCATION>, creating concern in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about Soviet inroads in the region. More recently, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has approached <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> for fishing access to Australian ports for refueling purposes and to Australian airports for fishing crews in transit. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said he would treat the request with caution. Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, such nations as <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> face poverty, overcrowding and unemployment. Many of the islanders have migrated to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> in search of jobs. `` All these are turning the once tranquil <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> into an increasingly complex set of real and potential troublespots,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> echoed that concern, calling the situation a powderkeg. `` The multiple problems of these islands has led to a rising discontent,'' the Telegraph said. `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been making big efforts to gain a stronger foothold in every island group through fishery deals and aid.'' Racial and ethnic divisions remain a major underlying problem of many <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> islands, where populations are mainly Melanesian. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> are examples. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is the major power in the region and its largest aid donor. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> has expressed concern about Libyan activities, going as far as to close down <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> last year after an incident involving the aboriginal activist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mansell </PERSON> had returned from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> saying <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was prepared to bankroll a black revolution in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The scattered violence in the South Seas has no single connective thread, although in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION> the crises erupted after <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> refused to follow the regional pattern of decolonization and independence. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> already suffers a major image problem in the South Seas with the bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> vessel Rainbow Warrior in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> in 1985 and its continued underground nuclear testing on the Mururoa atoll over the objections of almost every island state in the region. The island states, supported by <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, have declared the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> a nuclear-free zone. In a major turnaround, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 designated the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> an area of concern because of a buildup of the Soviet Pacific fleet. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe the Soviet fleet consists of 755 ships and patrol craft, including 141 submarines.

 It began with rural women passing on the traditional crafts of knitting and weaving, grandmother to mother to daughter. Today it is a $ 4-million-a-year business cooperative, shipping colorful sweaters around the world, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Manos del <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> -LRB- Hands of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> -RRB- is made up of 18 rural cooperatives whose workers spin, knit, weave and dye virgin wool, one of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s top commodities, entirely by hand. It was founded in 1968 by <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Beisso </PERSON> and four other members of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s high society who had second homes on ranch estates outside <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>. Unemployment was high in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s smallest republic at the time, so the five devised a way for rural women to do what they knew best _ weave colorful sweaters using natural vegetable dyes and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s virgin wool. The result is a richly colored wool woven in bright, distinctive sweaters, as well as in rugs, tapestries and placemats. Each article bears the name of the artisan and where it was made on a card accompanying the product. Finding many of the artisans' work sites on a map is often difficult: they include Tacuarembo, said to be the birthplace of famed tango singer <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardel </PERSON>, and villages such as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mellizos </LOCATION> and Quebracho. One thousand workers in more than 40 sites, some using just a loom or a table under a tree, labor over the sweaters, tapestries and rugs. Each sweater takes 12 to 28 hours to finish, Mrs. <PERSON> Beisso </PERSON> said. Most of the sweaters end up in shops in neighboring <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, but many are shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Seventy percent of Manos' sweaters are exported, said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Orfila </PERSON> <PERSON> Algalarronda </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Algalarronda </PERSON>, 36, was with Manos from its start, weaving from the village of <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. Two decades later, she is secretary counsel of the seven-member directorate -LRB- five women, two men -RRB- that oversees Manos' operations from <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>. Now one of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s largest exporters of wool, <LOCATION> Manos </LOCATION> is well-regarded in business circles for the quality of its work and fashion acumen. `` Manos is an experience that's practically unique in the world,'' Ms. <PERSON> Algalarronda </PERSON> said in an interview. `` The world is a very competitive place and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> is a very small place. But at a minimum Manos has turned into a source of work for 1,000 women.'' Each sweater, which costs the equivalent of about $ 30 in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, sells for up to $ 300 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, an aide in the promotion department of Manos' main office in the oldtown section of this capital city. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Manos sweaters can be found in some <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> stores, Mrs. <PERSON> Beisso </PERSON> said. Manos recently opened a small showroom in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Algalarronda </PERSON> said 50 designs are ready for the 1989 summer collection, including sweaters specially made for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -LRB- `` smaller sizes because the Japanese are smaller'' -RRB-, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -LRB- `` simpler designs'' -RRB- and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> -LRB- `` reds and blacks are popular'' -RRB-.

Manos is set up so that regional leaders from each cooperative elect representatives who then report to the directorate in <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>. All business decisions, from designs to marketing and exports, are made only after receiving input from the interior, Ms. <PERSON> Algalarronda </PERSON> said. Any profits _ 1987 sales were $ 4 million _ are plowed back into the business, helping keep those workers employed, which was the founding purpose of <LOCATION> Manos </LOCATION>. `` It's a fine source of employment but not a good business,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Beisso </PERSON> said. `` The people in the country are the ones who really profit from this.''

<HEAD>London Zoo Official Wants Animals to Have Fun, Too</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherdson </PERSON>'s job is to take the boredom out of life for the animals at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, putting something more into their day than sleeping, eating and watching humans. He has piped gibbon music into the the gibbon cage. For the mongooses, he has provided pieces of hollow wood filled with crickets for the animals to try to catch. `` Cricket dispensers,'' he calls them. He plans a light-and-sound show for the orangutans. The lanky 28-year-old Englishman, whose doctoral thesis had him tracking wild badgers by radio at night, became behavioral enrichment officer six months ago at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, the first British zoo to have one. Believing a little work for the animals is healthy, too, <PERSON> Shepherdson </PERSON> is making some species work for their dinners. `` Zoos should show the animal as it behaves in the wild,'' he said. `` For example, in the wild, most species spend more than 50 percent of their time foraging for food. ... In the zoo, they get fed once a day. `` You have a choice _ either change the environment, or you do n't keep the animals properly.'' <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, director of research at the <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>, the independent body co-sponsoring <PERSON> Shepherdson </PERSON>'s post, says the project also works well for people who visit the zoo. `` There is n't a great deal of point in them seeing an animal sitting in a corner behind bars,'' he said. He and <PERSON> Shepherdson </PERSON> say that while zoos in many countries are making cages more natural, few have spent much time studying animal behavior in relation to their habitats. The 161-year-old <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>'s gibbon monkeys never did much loafing in their tree-lined outdoor enclosure, but with the change in their zoo habitat they've become much more feisty. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> usually have one mate for life and assert their territory by singing. <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>'s pair were n't as musical as they should have been until <PERSON> Shepherdson </PERSON> hung stereo speakers near their cage and played taped gibbon duets twice a day. Thinking they have neighbors, the gibbons now sing, too. <PERSON> Shepherdson </PERSON> is also working on a computer keyboard to produce sounds, food or even slide shows when orangutans operate it. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said an electronic organ failed to excite the apes, `` so we'll try to get a keyboard which does more things than produce sound.'' Simple toys, often involving food, are best for most animals, <PERSON> Shepherdson </PERSON> said. He had praise for <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Markowitz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> behavioral enrichment pioneer who installed a machine to toss meatballs into a serval's cage, but added that he believes more naturalistic tools should be explored Recently <PERSON> Shepherdson </PERSON> equipped the ring-tailed lemurs' cage with poles that sway like the trees in the primates' native <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said one of the best ways to simulate natural behavior `` is to make an animal work for its food -LRB- and -RRB- spend normal amounts of time foraging.'' In the kinkajous' cage, carrots, bananas and apples hang from the ceiling, some tantalizingly out of reach for the weasel-like creatures. Before getting the snacks, the female paced for hours _ one of the first signs of boredom, said <PERSON> Shepherdson </PERSON>, watching as she pursued a banana just beyond nose-reach. `` Even tortoises pace, I'm told,'' <PERSON> Shepherdson </PERSON> added. `` It's not a lack of space, it's what you have in that space that's important. After a cage is outfitted, zoo workers watch the animals for hours to see how they respond. `` In every case so far, there's been a beneficial effect,'' said <PERSON> Shepherdson </PERSON>. `` If every zoo in the country did these things, it would be a great step forward in animal welfare.''

<HEAD>Puzzlement Surounds Patriarch's Snub To Soviet Festival</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It was all set, a rare convergence in the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> leadership, plus other top Christian echelons. But then, by some labyrinthine tangle, unravelings appeared in the Orthodox tapestry. Little was clear about why, and official statements about it were couched in the vague circumlocutions of Byzantine innuendo. It stunned and bewildered many churchmen. `` It's very strange and astonishing,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyendorff </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vladimir </ORGANIZATION>'s Seminary at <LOCATION> Crestwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and a leading theologian of the Orthodox Church in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` However you interpret the official statements, there must be other reasons. There is something more subtle and typically Mid-Eastern about it. They never, never say anything directly, but always sideways.'' What jolted Eastern Orthdoxy was the abrupt word last week that its top spiritual leader, <PERSON> Patriarch </PERSON> <PERSON> Demetrios </PERSON> of Constantinople -LRB- modern <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> -RRB-, wo n't attend Soviet celebrations of Christianity's 1,000 th anniversary there Most all of the Eastern church's nine patriarchs apparently had been going to be there June 5-16, including, or so it seemed, <PERSON> Demetrios </PERSON>, making it an unprecedented modern gathering of leaders of the world's 200 million Orthodox. <PERSON> Demetrios </PERSON> had visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last August, had friendly meetings with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> and other clergy, and said he planned to take part in the June celebrations there. Then came the cryptic announcement last week from Orthodoxy's <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriarchate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Constantinople </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Demetrios </PERSON> would not attend `` because appropriate conditions for participation do not exist. An Orthodox official in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, maintained then that <PERSON> Demetrios </PERSON> had determined he would not join in liturgies with leaders of the Russian Orthodox church in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> whose independence he did not recognize. However, that was an old issue, going back 18 years to 1970, when Russian Orthodoxy granted self-governing status to its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offspring, the million-member <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. While that status was not officially recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate, no open conflict or breach in communion occurred over it, and the matter seemed largely disregarded. Working relationships have gone on between the Russian-derived <ORGANIZATION> OCA </ORGANIZATION> and the 2-million-member <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which remains under governing oversight of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. `` There must be some other factor in Greek politics, memory or worry'' behind <PERSON> Demetrios </PERSON>' somewhat last-hour decision to avoid the gathering, says <ORGANIZATION> OCA </ORGANIZATION>'s Meyendorff, who had a friendly visit with him in 1986. `` I suspect there's something more to it than the American situation,'' <PERSON> Meyendorff </PERSON> added in a telephone interview. `` It may be just a pretext. That's very characteristic. Perhaps the Turkish government is behind it. It may be an administrative, not ecclesiastical, conflict. `` I personally do n't understand it. Something is behind it with which I can not fully connect.'' There also was puzzlement in Greek Orthodox offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the head of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodoxy </ORGANIZATION>, Archbishop <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON>, promptly called off plans to attend the Soviet celebrations, since <PERSON> Demetrios </PERSON> is n't going. <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON>, exarch -LRB- representative -RRB- of <PERSON> Demetrios </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, meanwhile was briefed by a <ORGANIZATION> Demetrios </ORGANIZATION> aide, <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chrysostomos </ORGANIZATION>, on the reasons for the sudden reversal of plans. Afterward, <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Chrysostomos </PERSON> said `` it became evident that through the millenium celebrations an attempt was being made to gain pan-Orthodox acceptance of certain ` anti-cannonical conditions''' The circuitously worded May 24 statement added: `` The cancellation of the trip became obligatory because the anti-cannonical conditions assume seemingly de facto recognitions concerning matters, already included in the agenda of the forthcoming preparatory meeting of the Pan-Orthodox Synod on which most of the world's Orthodox churches have already taken a position against.'' Asked what that meant, <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephanopoulos </PERSON>, information director for <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodoxy </ORGANIZATION>, said she just could n't be sure. `` They did n't want to say what the conditions were. It's a matter of trying to be diplomatic. `` They do n't want to offend anybody. The powers that be must know, but they evidently do n't want to say. Maybe there are other things, but as I see it, it's strictly ecclesiastical. `` It came so much out of the blue. It's a big shock. There's a lot of stories and rumors floating around.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Roshak </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> OCA </ORGANIZATION> clergyman, noted that the <ORGANIZATION> OCA </ORGANIZATION> is a canonically recognized member of the council of Orthodox bishops which <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> led in organizing 20 years ago. <PERSON> Roshak </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> @ Soviet office of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said that for <PERSON> Demetrios </PERSON> to cancel participation in the Russian Orthodox celebration was `` certainly not a sign of conciliarity and unity. `` It was not an exemplary thing to do. The church in the Soviet has enough problems. It has withstood difficulties and is at an uneasy moment that also has hopeful possibilities. This shift is very peculiar. `` It is too much a revival of Byzantine intrigue.''

Agreements reached in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> dealing with the environment; air travel; cultural, scientific and educational exchanges; nuclear tests and reduction of the risk of nuclear war led to the following events: _ A historic treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons was signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their third meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December The groundwork had been done in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. _ Eight Soviet high school students spent more than a month at the <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and eight <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> teen-agers studied at <ORGANIZATION> Novosibirsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> and Mathematics in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, the famous pianist, performed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in April 1986, the first time he played in his homeland in 60 years _ <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> formed a joint venture for direct flights between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> exchanged views on security and human rights with Soviet officials in a live television show beamed directly to audiences in both countries _ Twenty Americans toured the Soviets' test site at <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as part of an agreement to monitor nuclear tests; Soviet scientists did the same at a site in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> signed an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> to begin work on a conservation project designed to abate climate changes resulting from the warming of the globe, the `` greenhouse effect. _ Eleven Soviet researchers attended a symposium at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> last October on how to transport pesticides and the presence of chemicals in the environment _ The two sides agreed to open consulates in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> These have yet to be established, although preliminary work has started. Peripheral agreements are sure to grow out of the fourth Gorbachev-Reagan summit, opening Sunday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Not all summits lead to agreements; summit No. 2, the October 1986 meeting in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, was a public failure, ending in harsh words and recriminations on both sides. `` Much of this is dependent on changes in the Soviet society,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Guroff </PERSON>, speaking of the burgeoning number of people-to-people exchanges. <PERSON> Guroff </PERSON> is acting coordinator of the U.S.-Soviet Exchange Initiative at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The treaty signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that calls for the elimination of the nuclear missiles with a range of between 300 and 3,400 miles is the most significant agreement reached by the superpowers at the summit. But it has overshadowed some of the less-publicized results of the summit meetings, which are often the climax of months and years of behind-the-scenes diplomatic negotiations. One summit issue left over from 1985 _ steps to halt the spread of nuclear weapons to nations that do n't have them _ may resurface in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The two sides also may sign an agreement limiting experiments at the Soviet and American test sites, the Americans say. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has refused to push for ratification of a 1974 treaty on peaceful nuclear explosions for engineering purposes and a 1976 treaty that limits the size of such explosions until verification for both is improved. But for the average citizen of either country, such agreements are abstract and remote. Agreements in the scientific, educational and cultural fields are more likely to have results people can see, understand and applaud. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are thrilled with the enthusiasm Americans and Soviets have shown for getting to know each other, but they say the Soviets have a long way to go in matching the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to exchange programs. `` It's a dramatic change compared to the past, and the potential growth is quite exciting,'' <PERSON> Guroff </PERSON> said. In 1988, for example, about 15,000 Soviets will visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, while about 120,000 Americans will travel to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. The 15,000 figure _ high compared to the past _ is tiny when put into perspective, <PERSON> Guroff </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has sent about 15,000 students to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as many more tourists.

<HEAD>Orders For Durable Goods Up; Reagan Vetoes Trade Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: The Commerce Department reports on merchandise trade for the
first quarter at 10 a.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has vetoed major trade legislation amid signs that the nation's export business is picking up. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he vetoed the legislation Tuesday, as expected, because of his objections to a provision that would require companies to give their employees notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. `` I am convinced this bill will cost jobs and damage our economic growth,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his veto message. Within hours, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 308-113 to override the veto. The margin was well above the two-thirds majority required, but it was thought unlikely that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would go along when it considers the override after a Memorial Day recess. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for `` big ticket'' durables, items expected to last three or more years, rose 0.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $ 116.3 billion. The climb followed gains of 0.9 percent in March and 0.1 percent in February. Orders in April were 8.5 percent greater than a year earlier. The moderate increase in durable goods reinforced earlier signals of an improving trade picture, some economists said. `` It clearly shows that export orders are very strong,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, chairman of WEFA group, a Philadelphia-area economic forecasting firm. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last week reported that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports surged 23 percent in March to a record $ 29 billion, with much of the strength coming in machinery, aircraft and computers. The declining value of the dollar, which is less than half of what it was three years ago when measured against the Japanese yen, is bolstering sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods overseas by making them cheaper when compared with foreign goods. <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the cheaper dollar also is helping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers by boosting the cost of imported goods in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There are some hints that consumers are beginning to turn away from higher-priced imports in favor of domestic goods,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. With the signs of economic strength, comes concern that production in industries is approaching capacity limits, a development that could fuel price increases. However, <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said, `` I think the fears of an inflationary boom have been exaggerated right from the start. ... Even with an upturn in exports, we're not in the midst of an economic boom.'' In other economic reports Tuesday: _ Home prices continued to skyrocket in several Northeastern cities during the first three months of 1988, but the hot <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> market cooled somewhat after the October stock market crash, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said _ Mid-May sales of domestically made cars and light trucks rose 2.6 percent from a year ago despite some trimming of buyer incentive offerings, the auto companies said In the financial markets Tuesday, stock prices rebounded, but trading remained light. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.05 points to 1,962.53, or slightly more than 1 percent. Pessimism about interest rates continued to weigh on the market, sapping investors' willingness to commit their money to stocks. In other markets, the dollar and gold slipped as bond prices advanced slightly.

<HEAD>Junior High Schoolers Make Killing in Georgia Investment Game</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At a time when most seasoned investors were having trouble picking winning stocks, 11 middle school students in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> took $ 300,000 in pretend money and turned a $ 154,200 profit in 10 weeks of market action. The rookie investors _ seventh - and eighth-graders at <ORGANIZATION> Renfroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> who formed three separate investment teams _ swept the top three places among 2,700 teams that entered the statewide Stockmarket Game contest Their money existed only on paper. Their transactions were fed into a computer at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, not at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. All three winning teams' portfolios increased by more than half during the contest, while the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average rose just 1.3 percent. If a team's initial $ 100,000 investment had increased by the same amount as the Dow, it would have netted only $ 1,325 for a final portfolio of $ 101,325. `` The odds of three teams from the same school winning the top three spots are simply astronomical,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the 8-year-old contest for <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> students in grades 6-12. Equally remarkably, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said, all seven <PERSON> Renfroe </PERSON> teams made a profit on their $ 100,000, while only 22 percent of teams statewide managed to do so with the Dow hovering close to 2,000 throughout the contest. The students analyzed companies and combed stock analyses, with some teams profiting from huge purchases of low-cost stocks and others buying into well-managed firms whose stocks climbed slowly but surely. The common denominator among the top three teams was their purchase of stock in <ORGANIZATION> Blockbuster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Dallas-based company that owns and operates some video rental stores and grants franchises for others. Students bought the stock for about $ 31 a share in February and early March. To their delight, the stock split 2-for-1, and within weeks, the price of the newly split stock had climbed to about $ 24 a share _ or $ 48 for each original share. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hone </PERSON>, real-life stockbroker to <PERSON> Renfroe </PERSON>'s school librarian, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, had recommended Blockbuster to Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> as one of about 10 companies that the students `` might have fun with.'' `` I gave the stock to other people as an idea,'' said Mrs. Hone, `` but the price just kept climbing and climbing. More cautious adults looked at it and said, ` Oh, it'll pull back,' and they did n't buy it.''

<HEAD>Domestic Car and Truck Sales Up 2.6 Percent Despite Trimmed
Incentives</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Auto companies' decisions to offer leaner incentives in mid-May may have slowed domestic car sales but did n't hurt overall domestic vehicle sales, which rose 2.6 percent from a year ago, analysts said Sales of domestically built cars, which fell 2.2 percent in mid-May from a year ago, also dropped in the wake of an early May rush by buyers hurrying to beat the May 11 expiration of most major-maker incentive campaigns. The eight companies that build cars and light trucks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sold 345,004 in the nine selling days from May 11-20, up from 336,381 in the identical period a year ago, the companies reported Tuesday. Sales of domestic cars slipped to 216,325 from 221,127, while sales of light trucks rose 11.6 percent, to 128,679 from 115,254 a year ago. `` The companies think we're moving into the strong spring selling season and can afford to take off incentives, but every time they do, car sales fall,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> The incentive campaigns were extended, but many rebates were trimmed and some models were removed. Sales have remained stronger than expected so far in 1988, leading the Big Three to increase estimates of total 1988 vehicle sales, import and domestic, to 15.3 million from 15 million. Buying conditions have improved for consumers nationwide through lower interest rates, strong income gains and low unemployment, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Econometrics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. But much of the additional strength has come along the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coasts, where the weakness of the dollar against foreign currencies has boosted sales of products such as textiles, light machinery and lumber, he said. `` If the dollar does continue to weaken, then the price gap between import and domestic goods will grow and you'll get this boost in the interior section of the country, which produces heavy industrial products,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 3 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker, sold 3.1 percent more domestic cars and 31.9 percent more domestic trucks during mid-May than a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the domestic car market grew to 14.7 percent from 13.7 percent and its share of the domestic light truck market rose to 22.9 percent from 21 percent a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest automaker and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry leader, sold 6.4 percent fewer domestic cars during the period than a year earlier. But <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s light truck sales rose 10.5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the domestic car market slipped to 49 percent from 51.3 percent a year ago while truck share held nearly steady at 39.1 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's second-largest automaker, sold 2.6 percent more domestic cars than a year ago, but its light truck sales slipped 2.4 percent, the company reported. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the domestic car market rose to 29 percent from 27.9 percent a year ago but its truck share slipped to 35.5 percent from 37.8 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which reduced car production and increased truck production at its factory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, sold 52.4 percent fewer domestic cars and 112.9 percent more domestic trucks than in mid-May a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, which is gearing down its <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, factory toward this summer's closing, sold 39.3 percent fewer domestic cars than a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic car sales rose 37.2 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s rose 43.4 percent from a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> began building cars at its Flat Rock assembly plant in September and sold 992 in mid-May.

 The nation's top companies are placing more emphasis on creativity and communications skills and actively recruiting students who major in the liberal arts, a new survey shows. About one-quarter of 535 chief executives surveyed by <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> explicitly encouraged the hiring of liberal arts graduates and almost half of their companies said they seek humanities majors by recruiting on campus. `` There is a very substantial hiring of liberal arts graduates by the nation's major employers,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Useem </PERSON>, director of the university's <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, who conducted the survey, said Tuesday. <PERSON> Useem </PERSON> said companies with chief executives who advocate a broad education `` were out there hiring liberal arts graduates way above average.'' The study, completed earlier this month, was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in collaboration with the President's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Top corporate executives are more concerned than before, certainly than in the 1970s, about the overly narrow education of some of those who are applying for white collar jobs in the corporation,'' <PERSON> Useem </PERSON> said. Letters seeking information on hiring patterns were sent to the chief executives of the Fortune 1000, the nation's 1,000 largest corporations, and 200 mid-size companies. The survey had a 45 percent response rate, including more than half of the nation's top 100 companies. In addition, 505 middle and senior managers at large companies were interviewed by telephone about their career experiences working with other managers of varying educational backgrounds. `` What we've seen in recent years is perhaps more employers have become convinced of the value of a liberal education in terms of their long-range needs,'' said <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturman </PERSON>, director of career and employment services at <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> Increasing corporate competition in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad has made students with diverse backgrounds more attractive, the study showed. `` Some corporations are facing a much more competitive environment that places a premium on creativity and innovation, and they want people who can easily move across boundaries, think in an interdisciplinary way,'' <PERSON> Useem </PERSON> said. A nationwide survey by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> cited by <PERSON> Useem </PERSON> found that student interest in liberal arts is rebounding after a 10-year decline. It found that 25 percent of first-year college students reported an interest in a liberal arts major, compared with a low of 21 percent in the early 1980s, but far below the 40 percent of 1970. At the same time, 27 percent of students said they were interested in business arts majors, up from 24 percent in the early 1980s and 16 percent in 1970. `` -LRB- Companies -RRB- are looking for students who can be trained in that specific industry but will bring to the company a broader thinker,'' said <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON>, director of career development for <LOCATION> Haverford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bryn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mawr </LOCATION> Colleges in suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> said on-campus recruiting by businesses has doubled since 1980, with about 60 companies seeking students last year at the two liberal arts colleges, each of which have about 1,200 undergraduates. The principle attractions for liberal arts students are better salaries to help pay off tuition debts and training that can be applied to other jobs. `` If you do an undergraduate business degree and then a -LRB- master's of business administration -RRB- it seems to me the education is much too narrow,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` After all, anyone who wants to make a success out of a life in business or anywhere else needs to have a broad understanding of the human condition.'' At <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the largest of the nation's women's liberal arts colleges, economics was the second most-popular major among this month's graduates, 177 in a class of 700.

<HEAD>South Korea's Trade Surplus with U.S. Drops; Deficit with Japan
Shrinks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shrank to $ 2.58 billion between January and April from $ 2.69 billion in the same period last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Officials attributed the reduced surplus to efforts to increase imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and reduce imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to correct the bilateral trade imbalance, the source of friction with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The ministry officials said the Korean won's rise against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar also slowed the pace of Korean exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The won, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s currency, has risen 8 percent against the dollar since January. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> during the January-April period shrank to $ 1.31 billion from $ 1.85 billion a year earlier. The narrowed deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was attributed to brisk exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> helped by the strong Japanese yen as well as less reliance on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for machinery and raw materials. South Korean exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> between January and April were tallied at $ 6.07 billion, up 19.3 percent from a year earlier, while imports equaled $ 3.49 billion, up 45.8 percent. South Korean exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> jumped 59.1 percent to $ 3.56 billion, while imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> rose 19.1 percent to $ 4.87 billion. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> posted a worldwide trade surplus of $ 1.88 billion in the first four months of this year.

<HEAD>Report Says Texas Undermining Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some of the financial woes at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> must be laid at the door of parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which, even as it decries labor costs, siphons money and assets from the Miami-based carrier, a new report says. `` It is not possible for an airline to shrink its way to profitability,'' says the report by <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an international accounting and management consulting firm. The report, commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and criticized by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> spokesmen, details the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> for what it called less than market value and the apparently heavy management fees <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has paid <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> since it was purchased by the Houston-based company in 1986. `` Management of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> have defined <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s difficulties solely in terms of labor costs and unions; yet non-union <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> lost substantially more than unionized Eastern even after the adverse impact of the above transactions on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is taken into account,'' says the report, largely prepared by analyst <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupersmith </PERSON> `` Without the above transactions, the difference in performance at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> would have been even more dramatic _ with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> performing substantially better than <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>,'' according to the report. Eastern lost $ 182 million last year, compared to $ 258 million at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, also owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. Most of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s losses and erosion of liquidity are because of `` upstreaming'' of payments and assets to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, the report says. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which lost a total $ 466 million last year, is heavily leveraged with `` junk bonds,'' is dependent on `` upstreaming'' of cash from its subsidiaries, has overstated its liquidity and probably lacks credit standing for much new financial backing, <PERSON> Touche </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> says. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> called the report `` a work of fiction.'' `` The Touche <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> analysis is just replete with distortions and false assumptions,'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>, an Eastern spokesman said Tuesday, citing examples of figures he said were inflated in the report. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the report's conclusions showed `` a lack of understanding of normal business practices.'' The Touche <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> report cited $ 22.5 million paid by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> for strike preparation fees, $ 6 million in management fees paid last year by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, $ 9.1 million for administrative and fuel purchasing services paid to TAC, and tens of millions more paid for use of computers and reservations systems. Eastern, which has indicated plans to reduce flying further this summer, lost available passenger miles estimated worth $ 50 million to $ 75 million because of flying cutbacks, the report says. Some routes were transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is widely accepted that shrinking revenue raises cost per available seat mile and results in an exaggeration of losses,'' the report says. The Touche <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> report notes that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> attempted to sell its profitable <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> to become a subsidiary; a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union federal lawsuit has blocked it. There has also been talk of selling <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Latin American routes. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said such transactions as the sale of the Systems One reservations system to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> injected badly needed cash into Eastern. He said the fees Eastern now pays for use of the reservations system are less than what <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s own cost of operating the system would be. The management fees are `` a miniscule fraction of operating costs,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> contends that Eastern labor costs are too high and that the unions must make some concessions. Eastern is locked in federal mediation with its largest union, the 12,000-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> local. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> is expected to soon release the results of its own study, announced April 13, into the ability of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> to run airlines. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution has questioned <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to keeping Eastern viable. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday, federally mediated hearings opened to settle a bitter dispute between airline unions and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> over whether <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> should be considered a single airline for bargaining purposes.

<TEXT>
 The government expressed relief Wednesday after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed an omnibus trade bill providing for sanctions against a Japanese electronics maker and retaliation against countries that violate international trade agreements. The relief was qualified, however, by a vote overriding the veto in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and the reasons behind <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s disapproval of the bill. Speaking to reporters at his official residence, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> welcomed the veto and added, `` Concern now is primarily on domestic issues in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. When the negotiations -LRB- between the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- begin, the issues most affecting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will be brought out.'' During a news conference, <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, minister of international trade and industry, said, `` Our ministry has in the past requested efforts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government to see that the trade bill would not be enacted, and we welcome President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto.'' Opposition to the bill in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> stems mainly from provisions requiring retaliation against violations of international trade agreements and other `` unjustifiable'' practices. If enacted, the bill would transfer from the president to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representive the authority to decide what unfair trade practices another country is engaged in and what, if any, retaliatory measures to impose. A provision imposing sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and one of its subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for the subsidiary's sales of sensitive equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also concerns the Japanese. No mention of the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> sanctions was made in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto message, which focused on curbs on exports of Alaskan oil and a mandatory requirement forcing businesses to give employees advance warning of closures or layoffs. <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sold the Soviets milling machines that could be used to make submarine propellers quieter and more difficult to detect. The sales violated international rules regulating trade between the West and communist countries. <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> said he hopes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will support <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and that the bill will not be passed. `` But,'' he added, `` for us foreigners it is very hard to say what will happen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The House overrode the veto with a margin well above the two-thirds majority required, but it was thought unlikely that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would go along when it considers the override after next week's Memorial Day recess.

 Share prices were higher at midday Wednesday after British authorities cleared the way for <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 3.9 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and for <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON>'s 29.9-percent stake in the company. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 9.0 points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,791.9 at 12:30 p.m. local time. Volume was a moderate 324.9 million shares compared with 243.5 million at midday Tuesday. Traders said the market was enlivened by Trade Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s decision not to refer the <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> bid nor the Suchard stake to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s choice was terrific news for the whole market,'' said one equity salesman. <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>'s share prices surged on news of the bid, which was worth 2.1 billion British pounds.

<BYLINE>US-Japan Beef Pact Seen Likely Soon</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 A top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef industry representative on Wednesday praised the `` hardline approach'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators in farm trade talks with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and predicted a favorable bilateral beef agreement would be concluded by the end of May. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Seng </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said recent concessions by the Japanese government should serve to break an impasse in talks to renew a beef and citrus fruit pact that expired in March. `` Our government's approach of hardlining it ... has already paid dividends as far as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -LRB- beef -RRB- industry is concerned ... I think hopefully we can actually realize a bilateral agreement within the month,'' said Seng, whose federation represents major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm organizations and businesses. Last week, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> instructed the government party to seek a speedy solution to the dispute, brought about by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for full access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s beef and orange markets. He leaves next Monday for an official visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Other government officials, including <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, have also indicated recently that an agreement was expected soon. Bilateral talks to settle the beef and orange issue broke down in April after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> flatly rejected a Japanese plan to counterbalance market-opening measures with variable surcharges on beef imports, aimed at bringing import prices up to domestic levels. But <PERSON> Seng </PERSON> said the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, strongly dependent on the rural vote, was prepared to scrap the levy or surcharge and retain the present tariffs. <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> `` indicated that they will just have a tariff at the end of the day,'' <PERSON> Seng </PERSON> said. Other officials have `` indicated that they would raise their quota -LRB- of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef imports -RRB- to 40,000 metric tons per annum for the next three to four years, that's a substantial increase over the 9,000-metric-ton -LRB- annual -RRB- increases that we've enjoyed so far.'' Seng also said a bilateral beef agreement would include a reduction in the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, which controls some 80 percent of beef sold throughout <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He ruled out a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move to abolish the quasi-governmental organization that slaps a 50 percent tax on imported beef prior to the complicated wholesale stage. `` Rather than trying to attack the LIPC open-faced ... -LRB- the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategy is -RRB- to effect change, meaningful change, in the role of the <ORGANIZATION> LIPC </ORGANIZATION> and limit the amount of control that they do have.'' On May 4, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> brought the dispute to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based forum to rule on international trade disputes. But both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese officials have maintained they will continue efforts to forge a new agreement out of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef shipments to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> account for some 85 percent of the 193 million pounds the nation exports annually, worth some $ 600 million. That figure, says Seng, could be multiplied by three to four times if <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> fully liberalizes its market.

 Farm equipment manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says an improved farm economy helped boost its net earnings in the second quarter by 145 percent, compared with the year-ago period. `` North American retail sales of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> agricultural and industrial equipment during fiscal 1988 have increased significantly over last year's levels,'' Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said in a statement Tuesday. <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> reported net income of $ 86.4 million, or $ 1.26 per share, for the three months ended April 30, compared with $ 35.3 million, or 52 cents per share, for the same period a year ago. Net sales increased 27 percent, from $ 1.14 billion to $ 1.45 billion, the company said. `` During the remainder of the year, we expect retail sales ... to exceed those in the final half of 1987,'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. Worldwide production of all Deere products in 1988 was scheduled to be about 30 percent higher than actual 1987 output, he noted. `` The agricultural economy has continued to strengthen in 1988 with improvement in a number of important agricultural economic indicators,'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. `` Price competition remains keen in our markets, but the fundamentals of our businesses are stronger and our operating results greatly improved.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> agreed that <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> had been helped by a turnaround in the agricultural economy, noting that record high farm earnings of $ 55 billion were posted in 1987. `` Earnings this year are expected to be close to last year's record high,'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> said `` That is helping to improve farmland values. Farmers feel a little more confident now about going out and making capital expenditures.'' <PERSON> Deere </PERSON>'s net income for the first six months of 1988 was about $ 154 million, compared with last year's net loss of $ 157 million, which included the adverse effects of a strike through the first quarter. Analysts said the weak dollar probably helped <PERSON> Deere </PERSON>'s exports to increase by 36 percent, to $ 340 million from $ 251 million last year. They also noted that <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> has drastically cut its workforce in the past nine years, lowering employment costs. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> employment last year was only 37,931, compared with 65,392 in 1979.

 Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have urged shareholders to refrain from selling their stock until the company can review a $ 197 million takeover bid by <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> stock jumped $ 8 a share to close at $ 59.25 Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading, indicating that investors expect <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> to sweeten its current $ 52-a-share offer. In a letter to shareholders, <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> Chairman W.M. <PERSON> Hannon </PERSON> and President J.L. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said the company's board was `` considering the <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> offer. The board will complete its review and communicate with you no later than June 7 to advise you of the company's recommendation.'' Analysts said the offer must rise to at least $ 227 million _ $ 60 per share _ to be accepted. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> directors rejected an earlier <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> bid of $ 48 per share, or $ 182 million.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is phasing out its AAdvantage frequent-flier program in favor of two new plans _ one that requires fewer miles for free trips but has more restrictions, officials said Tuesday. In one of two new programs _ PlanAAhead _ members must fly 20,000 miles to receive trips anywhere in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and 30,000 to get trips to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DiNuzzo </PERSON> said. Under the existing AAdvantage program, members had to fly 35,000 miles to receive free trips, but also could use credits to fly to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. On the PlanAAhead program, however, no free flights are available on some holidays, including Christmas and New Year's Day, and seating may be limited, <PERSON> DiNuzzo </PERSON> said. Under the AAdvantage program, there are no holiday `` blackouts.'' The second new program, AAnytime, has a mileage threshold double that of PlanAAhead but no blackouts or limits on the number of seats available, <PERSON> DiNuzzo </PERSON> said. There is also a three-year expiration date under mileage credits earned under the new programs. People who join AAdvantage after Jan. 1 will be covered only by the new programs; credits that current AAdvantage members earn after June 30, 1989, will also apply only to the new programs, <PERSON> DiNuzzo </PERSON> said. `` The new award structure allows more flexibility in how members use awards,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>, senior vice president-marketing at Fort Worth-based American. `` Although there may be some limits on the number of award seats on certain flights, initially at least 50 percent of our seats will be made available for award use,'' he added.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its first-quarter, pre-tax profit rose 14.1 percent over a year ago on a robust performance by its tobacco operations. That performance more than offset a decline in contributions from financial services and disappointing results in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the company said. Pre-tax profit for the first three months of 1988 came to 283 million pounds, or $ 529 million at current exchange rates. That was up from 248 million pounds in the year-earlier period. Net profit increased 14 percent to 163 million pounds, or $ 305 million, compared with 143 million pounds in the 1987 first quarter, the company said. Revenues gained 4.2 percent, to 3.97 billion pounds, or $ 7.42 billion, from 3.81 billion pounds. The company said the adverse effects of currency movements reduced pre-tax profit by 17 million pounds, or $ 32 million, in the latest period. This reflected the pound's gains against <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies, it said. Tobacco operations contributed 163 million pounds, or $ 305 million, to operating profit, up from 120 million pounds, helped in part by strong gains in exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> following greater opening of the Japanese market to imported cigarettes, BAT Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> told a news conference. Operating profit from financial services, however, fell to 88 million pounds, or $ 165 million, from 92 million pounds, as a result of a decline in the value of investments of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> unit following October's stock market crash. Paper and pulp interests had operating profit of 64 million pounds, or $ 120 million, up from 60 million pounds. The company said the weakness of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing market in the fourth quarter of 1987 continued in the first three months of 1988.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit shrank by 12.7 percent from January through March, the biggest improvement in five years, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the difference between what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imports and what it exports totaled $ 35.9 billion for the first three months of 1988, down from a deficit of $ 41.2 billion in the last three months of 1987. The 12.7 percent decline represented a dramatic turnaround in a deficit that has steadily worsened oveyears. It was the biggest quarterly improvement since an 18.9 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 1982. The new figures confirmed an improvement that had already shown up in the department's montr the last five hly merchandise trade reports. The earlier figures showed a 16.4 percent drop in the deficit to $ 36 billion in the first quarter, compared to $ 43.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Today's figures are smaller because they subtracted factors such as the cost of shipping and insurance and military sales from the monthly numbers. The balance-of-payments deficit is also adjusted for seasonal variations; the monthly figures are not.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The improvement in the first quarted the fact that exports climbed faster than imports, although both hit all-time highs. Exports jumped 9.8 percent to a record $ 74.7 billion while imports rose 1.3 percent to a record $ 110.6 billion. The administration is counting on strong export sales to provide close to half of total economic growth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year. The figures for the first quarter show that this estimate is on track. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has also pointed to the improvement in the trade deficit as an argument against passing protectionist trade legislation. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday vetoed the omnibus trade bill and Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are expected to cite the big drop in the trade deficit as a strong argument that this would be the wrong time to threaten trade retaliation against other countries who are purchasing record levels of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products. Exports of both agricultural and non-agricultural goods increased in the first quarter. The trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> fell by $ 1.9 billion to $ 12.9 billion. The trade deficit with Western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> dropped by an even sharper $ 3.8 billion to $ 4.5 billion. The deficit with the newly industrialized countries of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, fell to $ 1.1 billion to $ 6.9 billion.

 Federal regulators have given <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> a 45-day extension for completing its hostile tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and the unwanted suitor extended its bid until the end of this week. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s action Tuesday prompted <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON> to delay acting on <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge to <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s latest anti-takeover `` poison pill'' defense. Meanwhile Tuesday, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> reinstated its board of directors after a final count showed it had beaten <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> in the bitter proxy battle for control of the company. <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON> also set up a briefing schedule for <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge of the election results The company must submit supporting documents by next Tuesday, and a hearing on the issue will be held by June 3. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> had asked federal regulators for an extension to consummate its proposed takeover of <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, which has been stalled by a number of factors, including a series of lawsuits, the outcome of the proxy fight and from <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s poison pill. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> granted a 45-day extension Tuesday, it noted it was concerned about some possible adverse affects of the merger. The board required <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> to notify the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> when it had acquired 5 percent of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s shares and obtain the board's permission before proceeding with the takeover The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had given <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> conditional approval for the merger in February. That approval was scheduled to expire on today. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> has maintained it will proceed with its $ 1.1 billion tender offer, and run <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> as a separate subsidiary, regardless of whether it could win control of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board. The offer is for $ 15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of Irving's 18.5 million common shares outstanding. It was set to expire at midnight Tuesday, although it was extended until midnight Friday and conditioned upon <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> receiving at least 67 percent of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s shares. As of last Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> held about a 50 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, including shares it owned and those tendered. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> recently took steps to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> from proceeding with its tender offer. Last week, it amended its `` poison pill'' so that it would be activated should any unwanted investor acquire at least 20 percent of Irving shares on the open market. The poison pill previously would have gone into effect in the event of a takeover not supported by management. Poison pill defenses are designed to discourage takeover bids by greatly increasing the cost of an acquisition. In <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s case, all existing shareholders except <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> would be allowed to buy <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> shares for half-price once <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> acquired 20 percent of Irving shares. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> has steadfastly rejected <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> takeover proposals, instead opting for a friendly merger with the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second largest bank. The company announced today that its board unanimously approved <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION>'s sweetened cash offer of $ 80 a share for a 51 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>. The revised bid, up $ 5 a share from the previous offer, was conditional on Irving keeping intact the latest anti-takeover defense it adopted to fend off Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> bid is part of a complex restructuring plan that includes sale of Irving assets, several cost-cutting measures and a special $ 10 dividend. The proposal still needs regulatory approval. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said his company has no plans to raise its tender offer. The company had proposed increasing the stock portion if <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> agreed to hold friendly talks and dismantle its poison pill defense. But <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors unanimously rejected that proposal last week. In a reconvened annual shareholders' meeting Tuesday, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said its shareholders re-elected the incumbent board over <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s slate of 16 nominees by 52 percent to 48 percent. The count confirmed preliminary results that were released earlier this month. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said it would file suit in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to declare the results invalid. The company claimed that four Irving shareholders with more than 950,000 shares of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> stock confirmed that their votes were improperly counted.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Ruling Against Hallmark Cards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATTY REINERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling temporarily forbidding <ORGANIZATION> Hallmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from making greeting card designs resembling those of a small competitor, clearing the way for a full trial of the company's $ 50 million damage suit against Hallmark. `` Blue Mountain Arts has pushed the bullies back to the alley. We've been waiting and waiting on the ruling and it's entirely in our favor,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gall </PERSON>, general manager of the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, Colo.-based company, which won the injunction. `` We are absolutely ecstatic.'' Blue Mountain brought suit against Hallmark, based in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, in July 1986, alleging that <PERSON> Hallmark </PERSON>'s `` Personal Touch'' line of greeting cards is deceptively similar to <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION>'s `` AireBrush Feelings'' and `` WaterColor Feelings'' lines. Blue Mountain alleged that Hallmark was guilty of unfair competition and copyright infringement. A federal court ruled in November 1986 that <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION>'s two card lines have `` an inherently distinctive and highly uniform overall appearance that is recognizable and attributable to Blue Mountain.'' It ordered Hallmark to stop producing and marketing 83 specific greeting card designs. The Blue Mountain cards are characterized by backgrounds of soft colors done with air brush blends or light watercolor strokes. In April, Hallmark appealed the injunction order, arguing that a single greeting card company should not have `` perpetual rights to a style of art, a style of text and a concept of their combined use.'' In Tuesday's decision, the 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> affirmed the injunction, saying the lower court was correct in determining that the combination of features comprising the trade dress, or the overall appearance, of Blue Mountain's cards can be protected. A date for a full trial is expected to be scheduled now that the appeal has been decided. <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> is seeking $ 50 million in damages from Hallmark and will fight what they consider Hallmarks's other `` copycat'' card designs `` It's not only a victory for <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and me and for <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION>, but it's also a victory for the arts and for all creative people,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Polis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schutz </PERSON>, a poet who co-founded Blue Mountain with her husband <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schutz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Polis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schutz </PERSON> said Blue Mountain's main complaint was the look of the cards, which she said confused everyone, `` including myself.'' `` This decision means you can create something and not have to worry about it being stolen,'' she said. `` One of the things that <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and I learned is that it is possible to stand up for your rights no matter how small you are or how big your opponent is.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hucker </PERSON>, a spokesman for the greeting card giant, said Tuesday night that Hallmark was disappointed but not surprised by the decision. `` We will consider making a further appeal. It is important to understand that this is a preliminary decision based on a limited airing of the issues,'' <PERSON> Hucker </PERSON> said. `` We will have the opportunity to present our case in full for the first time at the trial.'' <PERSON> Hucker </PERSON> noted that the Blue Mountain suit contended Hallmark copied the smaller company's look. `` It is absolutely not true, and they know it's not true, that we copied specific designs,'' he said.

 Grain and soybean futures opened modestly higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as fears of dry weather continued to dominate the market. Little rain was forecast for the nation's midsection for the rest of this week, and the newly planted corn and soybean crops need rain to get off to a good start, analysts said. `` There's also some follow-through buying from yesterday's sharply higher close and that's about it,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's really nothing else of any consequence. <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said bullish traders hoped to bid the November soybean contract above its lifetime high of $ 8.08 a bushel today. A successful test of that barrier could prompt a new surge of buying, he said. In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 3 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.51 a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.20 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 cent higher with July at $ 1.76 a bushel; soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents to 6 cents higher with July at $ 7.86 a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were unchanged to .27 cent lower with June at 72.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .90 cent lower with May at 80.85 cents a pound; hogs were .35 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at 53.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to .13 cent lower with July at 53.57 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Some Small Firms Brave The Market; Others Seek Alternative
Financing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Small companies still hunger to see their names on a filigreed stock certificate, but it's a luxury few can afford these days. The companies that can make a convincing sales pitch for their stock to a jittery, post-crash Wall Street are those with substantial track records and solid, innovative products. But other young companies are shrinking from the prospect of selling stock at fire-sale prices and instead are knocking on the doors of venture capitalists, who may ask for a few board seats in return for capital. Industry insiders say the market crash and its aftershocks have been devastating for less-developed companies by limiting the financial tools they depend on. `` A lot of companies wo n't be financed, and it will lead to a pruning out, a survival of the fittest,'' one expert said. Since last October's Black Monday, the number of initial public offerings raising $ 25 million or less _ a size typical for small companies _ has fallen off dramatically. In April 1987, 28 such offerings were recorded, raising a total of $ 205.4 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> IDD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Last month, only 10 offerings were made for a mere $ 53.2 million The intervening months saw even fewer new issues. A pervasive lack of investor confidence is the main reason it has become `` almost impossible for companies without a strong record of earnings or strong evidence of exceptionally powerful technology to go public,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Orland </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Amev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Many companies simply scrapped their plans after the Oct. 19 market collapse. <PERSON> Orland </PERSON> had three companies that had registered with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to issue stock, but they aborted their plans rather than slash the offering price. <ORGANIZATION> Pulse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> maker of electronic components that hoped to raise about $ 15 million by selling shares for between $ 9 and $ 10, was one of those companies. <PERSON> Orland </PERSON> said the stock price would have been `` substantially lower'' had the company decided to go ahead with the issue in the wake of the crash. Instead, the group was able to secure additional bank financing. Not all companies are that fortunate. `` A lot ca n't fill the gap, and we are seeing many situations of aborted public offerings coming to us for financing,'' <PERSON> Orland </PERSON> said. But money from venture capitalists is exchanged for a piece of ownership, forcing management to decide how much control they are willing to give up. For young companies, the alternatives can be limited. Some have opted to go public anyway at lower offering prices, while others are bootstrapping their way along _ simply growing slower without the funds. Still others are seeking mergers or equity links to larger corporations. <ORGANIZATION> NeoRx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Seattle-based biotechnology firm, had registered with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in March to raise $ 30 million but has since witnessed `` a deterioration in the market, particularly in biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks,'' said Chief Financial Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Littauer </PERSON>. In the meantime, <PERSON> Littauer </PERSON> said the company is looking for other methods of financing until the market turns around. So far, the company has held discussions with a Japanese company and a European firm. `` We would be doing that anyway,'' <PERSON> Littauer </PERSON> said, `` but we might make the terms more responsive to our current situation _ we might ask for a larger up-front payment so we can use it as a tool to help our current financial situation.'' Companies that are braving the stock market's choppy waters are established, often showing annual revenue in excess of $ 50 million. <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Boston-based hazardous waste firm with $ 50 million in annual revenue, raised $ 10 million last November. Shares that initially sold for $ 9 each are now trading in the $ 14 range. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a partner in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Robertson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Stephens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the issue's success to `` institutional investors who understood the hazardous waste business,'' which he described as `` immune from the economy as a whole.'' Another market survivor is <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, Fla.-based <ORGANIZATION> Silk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greenhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a budding retail chain of artificial flowers whose stock traded as high as $ 16 a share after intially selling at $ 11. `` The market saw it as a new, unique retailing concept,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> explained. In addition to providing companies with needed working capital, going public has more subtle benefits. Entrepreneurs and small business owners agree there is a certain `` status'' to being publicly held. `` It makes a company seem much more substantial, and that's very important to many of our customers,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON>, president of the 4-year-old <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> software developer <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It conveys the impression we're here to stay, and it's important to original investors to have a mechanism for cashing in on their investment,'' said <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON>, who saw his own plans to issue stock delayed by three months Software Performance currently is scheduled to go public in September rather than June. <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON> noted that the small size of the offering _ the company is seeking to raise only between $ 2 million and $ 3 million _ helped insulate it from post-crash queasiness. `` There are still underwriters and investment bankers that need to make a living,'' <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON> noted. Ironically, he found the crash `` actually left us with an opportunity ... because there are not a lot of companies left to do an offering, and a strong company that is set up properly actually is more attractive now.'' Indeed, for venture capitalists who often specialize in early-stage financing, business is busy. `` We're looking at more, we're traveling more, but we're being discriminatory,'' <PERSON> Orland </PERSON> said. While investors may not be attracted by the potential of handsome returns that go hand-in-hand with speculative deals, venture capitalists have before them some significantly undervalued companies. `` People ask if the market window -LRB- for financing -RRB- is open or shut, but the market really is like a filter,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> explained. `` After the crash, the market is tougher and the filter is finer, but ` fine' companies, if you will, the really good companies can get through. There's billions out there.''

 When the publication <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> on Campus was first sent to college nearly six years ago, its owners hoped students would read it and later graduate to its parent, <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>. Not enough students made the step up, however, and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> recently announced that <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campus </ORGANIZATION> will make its final appearance this fall. It wo n't be the only dropout among college magazines, although their reasons for calling it quits vary. <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced that it was suspending publication of the 5-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Careers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, citing lagging advertising support for campus publications. And Whittle Communications, a media concern based in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, published the final issue of its 17-year-old Campus Voice magazine in March, saying it had become too hard to stand out from the crowd of college magazines. Media analysts say a shakeout was inevitable as the number of magazines, newspapers, billboards, sampling programs and other media options aimed at college students mushroomed in the mid-1980s. Publishers felt advertisers would salivate at the chance to reach an audience numbering about 12 million with estimated purchasing power of about $ 30 billion a year, malleable brand loyalties and promising earnings prospects. The audience remains attractive for some advertisers, such as those in automotives, electronics, beverages and snack foods, but their ad budgets have limits, said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON>, director of print media for the advertising agency <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION>. `` With a preponderance of media vehicles available, the advertiser made his choices,'' <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> said. He said they tended to pick magazines with `` pizazz and excitement'' because there was a better chance students would look at them. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Achee </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Alan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, Calif.-based company that publishes three magazines targeted at segments of the college audience, estimated national advertisers spend about $ 35 million a year specifically to reach college students. That figure includes only product and service advertising, not recruitment advertising or local and regional ad spending, which <PERSON> Achee </PERSON> said could push total spending toward $ 100 million a year. <PERSON> Achee </PERSON> said his company has survived the shakeout by focusing on narrow segments of the college market and using the mail instead of simply leaving the magazines at high-traffic spots on campus. <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>'s Moving Up magazine is sent to about 500,000 men who are college juniors, seniors or graduate students; College Woman goes to about 700,000 women who are college students and College Musician goes to 100,000 college music students through their teachers. Even those who are closing magazines say the audience remains attractive. <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> intends to promote its main magazine more aggressively on campus. <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> plans to offer advertisers a chance to be the only sponsor of special editions of Business Week Careers. Whittle plans multi-panel wallboards for the campus that will carry news, features, job information and advertising. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> on Campus was never intended to be a major profit contributor. It was launched in September 1982 as `` a way of introducing college students to <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>'s style of reporting and editing,'' he said. The strategy did n't work. Although <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> on Campus circulation reached 1.3 million this year, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said there was insufficient indication that readers later subscribed to <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> and some evidence that the number of students reading <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> itself had dipped. It appeared six times a year, and its last issue will be the back-to-school edition this fall. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> on Campus was at a disadvantage in selling ad space because some competitors who publish magazines also offered sampling programs and other promotions aimed at college students. <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>, for instance, offers sampling, direct mail and college newspaper ad placement services, a movie guide and campus promotions as well as magazines. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plans to continue publishing its Student Life college magazine twice a year but is launching other services to reach college students. Student Life publisher <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulkeley </PERSON> said marketers will have a chance to advertise in Student Life, distribute a sample of their products through college bookstores assembled by Time and give away coupons through posters on campus or by direct mail. `` Stand-alone magazines have a tough time being successful in this market,'' he said. `` Advertisers are interested in more than just print.''

 Federal regulators and senators today offered a cautiously upbeat view of the prospects for a rebound this year of the nation's banks, which in 1987 suffered their worst year since the Depression. The regulators, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, noted two longstanding problems dragging down banking as a whole: shaky loans to Third World countries and bank failures in southwestern states whose economies are heavily dependent on oil. `` There are two areas of concern,'' said the comptroller of the currency, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, whose office regulates nationally chartered banks. `` But they should not overshadow the fact that the national banking system remains sound.'' In the troubled southwestern states of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, which accounted for more than half of the post-Depression record of 184 bank failures last year, `` the worst may be over,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., agreed that `` the picture this year is by no means gloomy. But he warned that the financial devastation in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> could be an indication of what lies ahead if the national economy turns downward. `` What haunts me is that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> today might be the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tomorrow if we have a national recession,'' he said. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures bank deposits up to $ 100,000, said many banks are prepared to withstand a short recession with few ill effects. He added, `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> fund is adequate to deal with any problems we can forsee in the banking system in 1988.'' By any measure, 1987 was a disaster for the nation's 13,650 commercial banks. The industry as a whole recorded a profit of only $ 3.7 billion on $ 3 trillion in assets, the worst performance since 1933. The nation's largest banks set aside reserves in anticipation of losses on loans to Third World countries. Nine of the 10 largest banks in the nation and 17 of the 25 largest recorded a loss for the year. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said `` meaningful progress'' has been achieved on the Third World debt problem. `` Leaders in a number of borrowing countries have recognized the need to restructure their economies,'' he said. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, in a trip to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, last week said that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks would hit bottom in 1988 and improve next year. He has been predicting that bank failures in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> should climb from 50 in 1987 to 70 this year, but that improvements elsewhere should hold bank failures nationally to about the same level as last year. One substantial, but known, cloud on the horizon is <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicbank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. In March, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> infused $ 1 billion into banks owned by the huge holding company with the idea of coming up with a permanent rescue package within six months. The ailing giant likely will cause the insurance fund, which stood at $ 18.3 billion at the end of 1987, to register its first loss in its 55-year history. According to an audit of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> released last month by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigating arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, bank profits probably will improve despite a continued high level of bank failures and `` continuing and long-term'' problems presented by Third World debt. Last month, 12 of the 15 largest bank holding companies reported increased earnings for the first quarter of this year. The banking committee hearing today is the second session on the condition of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial institutions. The first last week reviewed the state of savings institutions, where much of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' attention has been focused Compared with banks, the 3,120 federally insured thrifts are in much worse shape as a whole, posting a $ 6.8 billion loss last year. The S & amp; L insurance fund has been hard-pressed to cope with mounting insolvencies.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has decided not to take action against Wall Street underwriters and others who helped offer <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> bonds that eventually flopped in the biggest municipal bond default ever, a published report said today. The Wall Street Journal, quoting unidentified sources, said the commission's report is basically complete, but that it is not expected to be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> until the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> completes a proposal that would tighten up disclosure in the municipal bond market. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted on $ 2.25 billion in bonds sold for construction of two nuclear power plants in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The plants, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> Nos. 4 and 5, were abandoned in January 1982 and default occurred 18 months later. The Journal's sources said <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff had recommended earlier that the agency take enforcement action against certain parties, including underwriters. But the sources said <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> feared such an approach would tie up the commission's resources for years in such a complex case, and that a decision was made against taking enforcement action. <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today he did not expect any official comment on the newspaper account. He also said he did not know, or could not say, how widely the investigation's findings to date had been circulated. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgibbons </PERSON>, communications director for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he had not seen a copy of the investigation report and could not verify the newspaper story. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., a member of the investigations subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he could not confirm the report `` If these sources are correct, what it does is confirm the old adage: If you're going to mess up, do it big, because people might not have the resources to do anything about it. That's if this report is correct.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, said of the published report, `` If that is true, it is good news.'' In March 1987, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> disclosed that <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lawyers had informally advised supply system officials that they planned to recommend the commission file a civil action against <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> for fraud. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> said at that time it believed it was innocent and would vigorously defend itself. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigation was reportedly to have been released earlier this year, and it has become an issue of concern in the huge federal-court lawsuit filed by bondholders over <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>'s bond default. Defendants include <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, utilities that contracted for the two terminated plants, bond underwriters, attorneys and others. Major Wall Street firms that served as underwriters in the selling of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> bonds agreed last September to settle their part of the case for $ 92 million. However, some bondholders have argued that figure does not adequately reflect the underwriters' involvement in the alleged fraud, especially if the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigation finds in favor of enforcement action Trial for the case, dubbed Multi-District Level 551, is scheduled for Sept. 7 in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said it was unusual that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation had become public knowledge at all He said the commission was forced, by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, to disclose subpoenas it was issuing several years ago in its investigation. Since then, he said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled against the 9th Circuit in the matter, and the investigation once again gained its mantle of secrecy.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced a multibillion dollar purchase of as many as 100 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757s today, the second big order for the aircraft maker this month. Under the arrangement, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> will acquire 50 757s with an option to purchase 50 more. American Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> would not disclose a dollar amount, but analysts have said the order is worth up to $ 4.2 billion. American will take delivery of the planes starting in 1989. They are primarily designed as replacement airplanes for the aging 737s and 727s in American's fleet. The 194-passenger 757 jetliner, with a range of about 3,200 miles, burns 25 percent less fuel than comparable aircraft and will be powered by two Rolls Royce engines. `` Overall, this is a transaction that gives American, on excellent terms, a highly efficient new airplane that can make our fleet more efficient and productive and allow us to save truly impressive sums of money in the years ahead,'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> told a news conference here. Analysts have said Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> could break previous records in 1988, a decade after the aerospace giant introduced the twin-engine jetliner. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has had 276 aircraft ordered, compared with just 88 ordered at this time last year. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported that <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, was considering ordering as many as 60 of the 757s, worth an estimated $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.9 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> would neither confirm nor deny such an order was pending, or say whether <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> was negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. `` We simply do n't comment on rumors like that,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said Tuesday. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has received orders for 40 757s. From the time <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> announced development of the plane in 1978 through the end of 1987, just 239 of the planes had been ordered. `` It was just a matter of time before the 757 would grow into its time,'' analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Elsworth </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. The company's previous largest order was just last week, a $ 4.6 billion deal for 100 planes being purchased by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Even with the possibility of 160 additional orders, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate plans to add workers to its 757 production line at <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, or to increase output from the current four 757s a month. The line has a capacity of about seven planes a month, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. Any large orders would lengthen the life of the production run and stabilize work schedules, he said. Orders are indicators of future business for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, since the company is n't paid by customers until planes are delivered. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, aerospace analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the American order means the time has come for an aircraft program `` that was the fly in the ointment'' for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, he said. New orders, he said, may turn `` what has been a continuous-loss program into what will be a continuous full-production line.'' <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said the large <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> order and rush of interest in the 757 may be the start of a bonanza year for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. `` It may encourage everyone to hurry up and get their place in line,'' he said, if they want new aircraft delivered before the mid-1990s. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had a record $ 20.2 billion in commercial jet orders for 1987, but <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said 1988 could see orders reaching $ 25 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> intended the 757, which first flew in 1982, as the eventual replacement for the aging 727 tri-jet, which went into service in 1964. The new plane is quieter than a 727, far more fuel-efficient, features a computerized cockpit and can be flown by a crew of two, instead of three. It also costs $ 41 million to $ 47 million, which analysts say was enough to scare away new buyers when the price of oil fell in the early 1980s. `` When fuel went down, it became feasible to operate 727s with three pilots and big gas-eating engines,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` There was not a need to replace 727s that were fully written off as far as costs were concerned as long as fuel costs were low,'' <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said. `` But maybe we're seeing that 20-year-old airplanes are not worth flying'' because of higher maintenance, fuel and crew costs. Both <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said that with airports becoming more congested, the 757 is attractive because of its passenger capacity. And <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> noted that `` if you want an airplane delivered before 1991'' in the small - to mid-size range, the 757 is the one to pick, since <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s MD-80, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>'s A320 and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s smaller 737 series `` are all pretty well booked. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> does not release profit or loss figures on individual programs. But <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON> all said a new round of major orders should be enough to make the 757 a money-maker.

 Stock prices continued to edge higher today, but the market showed no signs of a broad-based rally. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.80 to 1,969.33 in the first 2 -LCB- hours of trading as trading remained thin. Gainers outnumbered losers 9 to 5 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 803 issues up, 446 down and 519 unchanged. Aside from trading related to dividend captures, the volume was about even with Tuesday's light dealings. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 68.32 million shares as of noon on Wall Street, compared to 81.21 million at the same time Tuesday, when there was heavy dividend-related trading. Analysts say the stock market will not make a healthy advance until volume increases. On Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average rose 21.05 points in thin trading. Investors have been preoccupied with high interest rates and the possibility that they could go still higher. High interest rates hurt Wall Street by cutting into the corporate profits that support stock prices, and by causing investors to take money from stocks and put it into high-yielding debt instruments. Interest rates may go higher in the short term, but they are likely to decline in the longer term because it will become apparent that the economy is not overheating, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Eigen </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said today. `` The economy is not booming and rates will not go a lot higher,'' <PERSON> Eigen </PERSON> said. When rates fall, he said, `` I think stocks can go a lot higher.'' In economic news, the government said the merchandise trade deficit on a balance of payments basis narrowed to $ 35.95 billion in the first quarter from $ 41.19 billion in the fourth quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Light, which headed the list of most actively traded issues, was up -LRB- at 30 -RCB- with more than 4 million shares traded.

 A <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> company Wednesday toned down an earlier announcement that it had reached an agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to assemble and sell thousands of American-designed personal computers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Televideo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transducer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION>, said that a final agreement has not been reached on all important points of the deal, which it had announced Monday.

Televideo Systems had not previously mentioned <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microelectronics </ORGANIZATION>' involvement. The Soviets would be represented by <PERSON> V-O </PERSON> <PERSON> Electronorgtechnica </PERSON>, an electronics trading company. Televideo also backed down from a conjecture in a previous press release that the joint venture, with proper nourishing, could grow into `` a PC giant, on a par with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and Apple.'' Advanced Transducer Devices, which makes components for personal computers, had said the joint venture expected to sell at least 4,000 personal computers in the first year. The computers would be for use in schools, factories and offices, but not the military. Televideo said it was optimistic a final agreement would be reached within the next few months, but it also emphasized that the transaction remains subject to approval by Advanced Transducer Devices and <ORGANIZATION> Elorg </ORGANIZATION>. Actual sales of the computer components are also subject to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government approval. The company, in a news release, said that <ORGANIZATION> ATD </ORGANIZATION>'s sales have increased from $ 300,000 in 1985 to $ 8.6 million through the six months ended April 30, 1988. Advanced Transducer Devices would need an export license from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> before shipping any computers, components or technical data. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> reviews export applications for most communist countries to determine if the product will significantly contribute to the military potential of the importer.

 Chinese first came to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as cooks and launderers in the gold rush 130 years ago. Today they're flying in from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> with millions of dollars to invest in businesses and real estate. For the large majority, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is a hedge against <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s reversion to Chinese Communist sovereignty in 1997 While <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> entrepreneurs find easy entry under <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s `` investor immigrant'' program, hospitals in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> in British <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> report an increase in the number of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> women who come to have babies because the infants automatically become Canadian citizens Other Chinese come as students and professionals. But the entrepreneurs and investors often get a special welcome. `` They have no problem flipping down 5 million dollars -LRB- $ 4 million -RRB- for a house because in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> it would be 20 million -LRB- $ 16 million -RRB-,'' said Premier <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. One recent buyer was <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, whose casino and ferry empire in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> makes him one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s richest men. He paid 5.5 million Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 4.4 million -RRB- for a 25-room mansion on Bridle Path, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s millionaire's row.

 Soybean futures closed sharply lower Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after some meteorologists increased the amount of rain in their forecasts for early next week. Grain futures prices also fell. Technical factors also entered into the fray Wednesday, analysts said.

At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 8 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.41 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.14 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 3 cents lower with July at $ 1.72 a bushel; soybeans were 20 -LCB- cents to 30 cents lower with July at $ 7.58 a bushel.

 Sales of existing homes rose 4.5 percent in April, the biggest advance since November 1986, a real estate trade group reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said that existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.48 million units last month, following increases of 2.5 percent in both February and March. Economists said increases in mortgage rates late in the month spurred sales as potential home buyers jumped into the market out of concern that rates would go higher. The April increase in sales was accompanied by a slight drop in prices, which fell by $ 200 to $ 87,700 compared to March. However, the resale price of a home was still 2 percent higher than a year ago, when the median price of a home was $ 86,000. In the Northeast, sales rose 6.2 percent from March to April to an annual rate of 690,000 units. Sales were up 5.7 percent in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 1.3 million units while the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> had a 2.3 percent increase in sales to an annual rate of 900,000.

 The stock market closed mixed today in quiet trading. Analysts said traders remained paralyzed, acknowledging that recent corporate earnings have been stronger than expected, yet fearful that interest rates could easily head higher. High interest rates hurt Wall Street by cutting into the corporate profits that support stock prices, and by causing investors to take money from stocks and put it into high-yielding debt instruments. Traders' reluctance to act has meant that volume has been particularly slow lately. Today's activity continued that trend, notable exceptions being interest-sensitive issues, such as banks and insurance companies, which showed healthy gains, and several other stocks related to real or potential takeover moves or _ to a lesser extent _ dividend-recapture strategies.

<TEXT>
 Business failures declined by 10.1 percent in the first quarter over a year ago as more farmers and retailers climbed out of the red, a report released Wednesday said. <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a business-information concern, said 15,211 businesses nationwide went under during the first three months of this year, compared with 16,924 in 1987. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION>'s chief economist, said 75 percent of the improvement was due to a decline in failures in the agriculture and retailing sectors. First-quarter retailing failures slipped 17 percent, to 2,918 from 3,515, while agriculture failures plunged 53 percent, to 596 from 1,266. `` The strong levels of consumer demand that characterized the early years of the current economic expansion also resulted in a high level of entrepreneurial activity in retailing,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. He attributed the improvement in the agriculture sector to the introduction of Chapter 12 into the federal bankruptcy laws. Chapter 12 protects farmers from their creditors while allowing them to reorganize. Other large declines in business failures included: mining, down 53 percent; transportation and public utilities, down 13.2 percent; manufacturing, down 11.1 percent; and construction, down 9.8 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> said. By region, the <LOCATION> West-South-Central </LOCATION> states _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> _ fared the best, with business failures down nearly 30 percent. But the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> states _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ had a 68 percent jump in failures. `` Until further data are available in 1988, it will be difficult to tell if the trend in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is somehow linked to the October -LRB- stock market -RRB- crash,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said.

 The stock market closed mixed Wednesday, after another day of slow trading that was punctuated by heightened activity in selected issues.

Even though the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average picked up 21.05 points on Tuesday, analysts said at the start of Wednesday's session that, until volume picked up, there would be little reason to expect a lasting upward move They were right. `` The market is in a gridlock, supported by strong earnings on the bottom, and fear of high interest rates on the top,'' observed <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON>, president of the <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON> @ <ORGANIZATION> Twenty-First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> securities firm.

 The dollar rose against major foreign currencies in quiet trading Wednesday and gold gave back its gains of recent sessions. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 453.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 459.20 an ounce late Tuesday. The recent stability of exchange rates encouraged foreign-exchange dealers to move their money into high-yielding currencies, such as Australian and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> dollars, and out of low-yielding currencies such as the West German mark and Swiss franc, traders said. `` The low-interest-rate currencies are out of favor,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, a corporate trader for <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The market showed little reaction to a report that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit on a balance-of-payments basis fell to $ 35.9 billion in the first quarter of 1988 from $ 41.2 billion at the end of 1987. The decline was expected, traders said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed little changed at 124.30 yen, up 0.05 yen. In later <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, it was quoted at 124.40 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 124.42 yen from 124.18 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.8650 from $ 1.8680 late Tuesday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling fell to $ 1.8631 from $ 1.8673 late Tuesday. Other dollar rates in late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, compared with rates late Tuesday, included: 1.7064 West German marks, up from 1.7007; 1.4238 Swiss francs, up from 1.4196; 1.2427 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2417; 5.7583 French francs, up from 5.7420; and 1,265.38 Italian lire, up from 1,262.03. Other late dollar rates, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.4245 Swiss francs, up from 1.4150; 5.7550 French francs, up from 5.7395; 1.9090 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9030; 1,264.50 Italian lire, up from 1,261.80; 1.2434 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2412. Gold prices fell in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and then followed suit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Prices were pulled down by a drop in the price of platinum and by reports of a major gold sale, possibly by an Australian mine, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikolay </PERSON>, chief bullion dealer for <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, R.I. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, before the European sell-off, gold fell 42 cents a troy ounce to close at a bid $ 460.27 an ounce. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the late bid price for gold was $ 454.50, down from $ 458 late Tuesday. The late bid price for gold in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was $ 454 a troy ounce, down from late Tuesday's $ 457.75. At the end of the trading day, gold bullion for current delivery fell to $ 454.40 a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from $ 460.60 an ounce late Tuesday. Silver was quoted at a bid price of $ 6.67 a troy ounce in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, down from late Tuesday's price of $ 6.71. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $ 6.592 a troy ounce from $ 6.754 late Tuesday

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Swiss chocolate maker <ORGANIZATION> Jacobs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suchard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday offered 2.1 billion pounds, or $ 3.9 billion, for <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> if the British confectioner agrees to a friendly merger. But Suchard, which just received British government approval to purchase up to 29.9 percent of <LOCATION> Rowntree </LOCATION>, said it would launch a hostile bid if its amicable approach failed. The announcement came immediately after the British government also cleared a competing hostile offer from Swiss foods giant <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. The approvals came in the form of a decision by Trade Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> not to refer <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s bid and <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON>'s stake to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Rowntree Chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said he was disappointed that the government failed to call for an investigation into <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s bid because of the `` important public issues to be considered. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> remains firmly opposed to <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s bid, which he said fails to reflect the true value of the company. <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> makes the internationally popular Kit Kat candy bars and After Eight chocolates, among other products. <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> did not comment on whether it would meet with <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>, which holds about 16 percent of <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>'s 224 million outstanding shares, said it was pleased the government will allow it to pursue its $ 16.64-a-share bid. While that bid values <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> at about $ 3.7 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> has said it would cost $ 3.9 billion to complete the acquisition. Suchard Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderau </PERSON> said his company was `` seeking a fundamentally different form of cooperation with <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>. If that does n't succeed, then we'll make a full bid.'' <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON>, a Zurich-based company with interests in chocolate and coffee, said it is seeking a recommendation from the Rowntree board of directors for a possible cash offer $ 17.58 a share, or for other means of joining the two companies' confectionery businesses. Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said a full bid from <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> would need government clearance. The Swiss companies' bids for <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>, dubbed the `` candy bar wars,'' have sparked controversy in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over whether <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> should remain in British hands. The takeover target and members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> pressured the Conservative government to refer the bid to the monopolies commission. But Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said Wednesday that in deciding whether to refer a bid, `` we look mainly at the effect on competition in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. These proposals raise no competition issues.'' He noted that <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> currently control 3 percent and 2 percent respectively of the British chocolate market. Critics claim it is unfair for Swiss companies, which are protected from takeovers by foreign firms, to bid for British companies that do not operate under the same protection. Opposition lawmaker <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> noted that `` people are now very worried.'' He said it seems <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> is among the first casualties in the `` battle for 1992.'' The Common Market intends to abolish all internal trade barriers to create a single European market of 320 million consumers by 1992. Earlier this month, the government cleared <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.. - based <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of a 17.7 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> General Cinema, which has announced that it does n't any longer consider its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> to be a passive investment, said Wednesday it increased its stake to 18.4 percent.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Futures Sink As Inflation Signals Weaken</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Precious metals futures prices fell broadly Wednesday on profit-taking as fears of inflation eased and the dollar gained strength against other currencies. On other markets, soybean futures plummeted and prices retreated for an array of commodities, including grains, cotton, livestock and meat, oils and stock-index futures. Prices for future delivery of platinum, which has led the precious-metals complex in posting impressive gains this month, dropped $ 11.20 per troy ounce across the board on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The platinum contract for delivery in July settled at $ 579.40 a troy ounce. July platinum rose from $ 515 a troy ounce at the beginning of this month to a high of $ 597.50 at one point during Tuesday's session. Analysts said the dollar's gains, declining commodity prices and nervousness about Thursday's government report on the gross national product all contributed to the fall in precious metals prices. `` Mainly, there's some uncertainty as to what the GNP number is going to be,'' said <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, director of investments for the <ORGANIZATION> Platinum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Whenever there is uncertainty and there are profits to be taken, they'll take their profits.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s index of 21 commodities, a rough indicator of inflation, fell sharply Wednesday, which spurred further selling of precious metals futures, analysts said. Nevertheless, many technical and fundamental factors suggest platinum, gold and silver will continue to rally, analysts said. `` I would categorize this as a normal correction following a meteoric advance in platinum since the beginning of the month,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savakl </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Nothing goes straight up like a rocket.'' <PERSON> Savakl </PERSON> noted that warehouse stocks of gold at the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> fell about 185,000 troy ounces Wednesday to a 10 -LCB- - year low of about 1.224 million ounces The physical tightness is supportive for the gold market and `` could be a prelude to an explosive upside move this summer,'' he said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 6.20 to $ 7.50 lower with June at $ 454.80 a troy ounce; silver was 16.2 cents to 18.2 cents lower with May at $ 6.592 a troy ounce. Soybean futures prices fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after some meteorologists increased the amount of rain in their forecasts for early next week. Technical factors also entered into the fray, analysts said. Attitudes turned bearish after an effort to push the price for November delivery of soybeans beyond $ 8.08 a bushel, the contract's lifetime high, stalled at $ 8.07 A sharp drop in cash prices for Argentine soybean meal also weighed on the soybean complex, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` But overpowering everything else is the weather,'' he said. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a six-to-10-day forecast calling for normal to above-normal rainfall in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> during the second half of next week. Wheat settled 4 cents to 8 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 3.41 \ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.14 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 3 cents lower with July at $ 1.72 a bushel; soybeans were 21 -LCB- cents to 30 cents lower with July at $ 7.59 a bushel Cotton futures, which are also weather-sensitive, posted steep losses on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The July contract settled 1.10 cents lower at 65.07 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on expectations of a temporary slowdown in wholesale meat demand. `` People are a little worried that the bulk of buying for the holiday weekend is pretty much done,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .25 cent to .65 cent lower with June at 71.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .75 cent lower with May at 80.95 cents a pound; hogs were .60 cent lower to .02 cent higher with June at 52.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .25 cent to 1.05 cents lower with July at 53.22 cents a pound Oil futures finished nearly unchanged in dull trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> crude oil settled 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with July at $ 17.37 a barrel; heating oil was .17 cent lower to .06 cent higher with June at 47.31 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .13 cent to .25 cent lower with June at 51.72 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .25 point lower at 255.80.

<HEAD>American Airlines Orders Up To 100 Boeing Jets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RENTON, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it would buy up to 100 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757-200s to replace aging aircraft in its fleet, giving the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> aerospace company its second multibillion-dollar order in as many weeks. American officials said they were ordering 50 757s for delivery between July 1989 and November 1991, with an option to purchase 50 more. The deal could be worth more than $ 4 billion to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Commercial Airplanes President <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said the order substantiates <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s belief in a plane that had been a slow seller since its launch a decade ago. `` I think most of you know that we've been probably a little disappointed with the 757 over the years,'' <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said. `` The purchase and thereby the endorsement of the product by an airline like <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> is going to be a real boost to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and a real boost to what we think is going to be a mainstay ... in the domestic and international markets,'' he said. American executives said exact cost figures were proprietary, but <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s vice president for operations, said the order was on `` very favorable terms for American,'' with the first 50 jets costing just over $ 2 billion, and the second 50 about the same. Analyst <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Demisch </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said `` American got a very good deal'' at a price of roughly $ 40 million a plane. Depending on configuration, 757s normally sell for $ 41 million to $ 47 million each. Industry analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> could be headed for its fourth straight year of record orders, topping 1987's $ 20.2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has had orders for 326 aircraft so far this year, compared with 366 ordered for all of 1987. Wednesday's announcement follows a May 16 firm order by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for 100 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft with options for 24 more. At $ 4.6 billion for the 124 planes, the <ORGANIZATION> ILFC </ORGANIZATION> deal was a record for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. Several newspapers have reported that <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, is considering ordering up to 60 757s worth an estimated $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.9 billion, possibly this week. Both <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials have declined to comment on the reports. American canceled an order to buy 15 757s in 1982 because of poor economic conditions, and <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has been talking with American about buying the new jet since. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s new jets will primarily replace aging <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s and 727s in its fleet. The 194-passenger 757 jetliner, with a range of about 3,300 miles, burns 25 percent less fuel than comparable aircraft and will be powered by two Rolls Royce engines. The 50 additional planes, if ordered, would be delivered through December 1993. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> last week, American Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said it was possible American could order yet another 100 757s by the end of the century. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> introduced the 757 in 1978 as a high-tech, fuel-stingy replacement for its 727 tri-jet, which went into service in 1964. But a drop in fuel prices and airline deregulation stalled sales. Just 239 of the jets were ordered through the end of 1987. So far this year, however, 90 757s have been ordered. Analysts say higher maintenance costs for older planes, tougher airport noise restrictions and airport congestion have brought the plane new popularity. `` It was just a matter of time before the 757 would grow into its time,'' analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Elsworth </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planned to increase 757 production at its <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> plant from four a month at present to five a month sometime next year. However, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> did not expect to need to hire many new workers. <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said American chose <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> engines for the 757 because of what he called its superior reliability over comparable <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Whitney models available. He said <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> undertook a vigorous competition to gain the order but `` Rolls simply prevailed.''

<HEAD>Sugarman Reportedly Loses Bid For Media General Board Slate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, who earlier this year launched a $ 1.8 billion takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, appears to have lost his attempt to capture three of its board seats, the company said Wednesday. Preliminary results from Friday's shareholders vote show the incumbent management nominees received more than 56 percent of the vote, compared to 42.6 percent for <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s proposed slate, Media General President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said Media General got the early results by telephone Wednesday afternoon from <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He said the election inspection company told him 86 percent of Media General's total outstanding 28 million Class A shares voted, with the incumbents receiving 13.5 million votes and <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s ticket of himself, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotterer </PERSON> getting just under 10.3 million votes. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, in responding to the Media General announcement, noted his slate's vote total and said, `` We fully expect that <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s management and their board of directors will respect the opinion of this large group of shareholders and initiate action that will maximize shareholder value.'' <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> was referring to his battle for management acceptance for his $ 70-a-share bid for Media General. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said a final report on the vote would not be made until both sides have had an opportunity to inspect shareholder proxies and to raise any questions with <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>. The family of Media General Chairman <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> owns 71 percent of the company's controlling Class B shares, which represent seven of the 10 board seats. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, a California-based investor with 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s Class A holdings, launched the takeover bid in February with a $ 61.50-per-share offer that he later boosted to $ 70. Subsequently, he and two associates challenged three Bryan-supported directors seeking re-election to the board's three Class A seats. In the weeks leading up to Friday's shareholders meeting, lawyers for both sides went to court seeking injunctions to stop the opposition from delivering what they characterized as false and misleading information to shareholders about the proxy battle. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> denied both parties' motions, saying the proper time to file them would be after the annual meeting Media General owns several daily newspapers, including the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> Times-Dispatch and <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> News Leader, as well as several weekly papers, television stations and cable operations. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> is the chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Barris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a producer of television programs, and <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, whose holdings including cement businesses.

<HEAD>Dayton Hudson Shareholders Accept Anti-Takeover Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders on Wednesday accepted an anti-takeover defense suggested by management and rejected a stockholder's request to dismantle another anti-takeover provision. A majority of shareholders voted at their annual meeting to stagger the terms of company directors so a hostile buyer would have to wait at least two years to elect a majority to the board of the nation's sixth-largest retailer. Under the plan, one-third of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> directors will be elected each year to three-year terms, instead of all directors standing for re-election every year, the company announced. Shareholders also rejected a request by the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a large pension fund, to put <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s `` poison pill'' plan to a shareholder vote. Directors adopted the poison pill, which allows more stock to be issued during a hostile takeover, in September 1986. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlefer </PERSON>, an investment officer with the fund, said the poison pill allows directors to block a hostile offer that could be beneficial to shareholders. <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Macke </PERSON> opposed <PERSON> Schlefer </PERSON>'s motion and defended the poison pill as a useful bargaining tool in takeover situations. <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> was the target of a $ 6.62 billion takeover attempt last year by <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>'s bid failed in the wake of the October stock market crash <PERSON> Macke </PERSON> told shareholders management will dedicate itself to making bigger profits and restoring its reputation on Wall Street. Minneapolis-based <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> has experienced a drop in annual profits two years in a row and earnings were down in the first quarter of 1988. <PERSON> Macke </PERSON> said earnings should grow by at least 15 percent this year.
