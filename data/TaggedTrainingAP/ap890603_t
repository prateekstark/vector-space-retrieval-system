 A <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> bishop has called for recognition of a `` church within a church'' as a haven for conservative Episcopalians opposed to such so-called liberal trends as the ordination of women. `` Let us firmly declare and commit ourselves to the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and to the provinces of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communion </ORGANIZATION> that it is our will to be the church within the church,'' the Rt. Rev. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said Thursday. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, bishop of the Diocese of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and president of the Evangelical and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, addressed nearly 1,200 delegates at the opening session of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synod </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> is president of the Evangelical and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, and he and other bishops in the mission called the synod last year after the Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was consecrated as the first female bishop in the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The bishops called Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' election `` the final crisis.'' <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> and other speakers contended that segments of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> are abandoning the biblical faith through decisions to ordain female priests and bishops and efforts to relax moral teachings on sexuality and marriage. `` We must do all we can to remain within this church and do all we can to transform this church,'' said the Rt. Rev. <PERSON> John-David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schofield </PERSON> of the Diocese of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joachin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` If it will not be permitted, then we will have to take the next step when it comes.'' <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s laws do not prevent the traditionalists from forming a voluntary association, and he called for the acceptance of the new organization as a way for traditionalists to stay within the church. `` We seek nothing more and nothing less than to provide a way to maintain and propagate the gospel of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> through the unchanged tradition of the historic church. ... Society, we believe, is hungry for this kind of church and gospel _ neither of which is subject to the shifting sands of this present age,'' <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>'s proposal would create a voluntary organization that would allow traditionalist bishops and priests to visit parishes. Traditionalist bishops, a small minority in the 2.9 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, say the church has lost 1 million members in the past two decades because of liberal changes, including the ordination of women.

<HEAD>Jury: California Must Share Cost of Stringfellow Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> should share the huge cost of cleaning up the Stringfellow toxic waste site, a project with a potential price tag of up to $ 740 million, a jury decided Friday. The six-member federal jury did not determine how much the state should contribute to the cleanup of the <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> hazardous waste site, leaving that decision to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ideman </PERSON>. The decision came after less than a day of deliberations. The Stringfellow site opened in 1956 and received an estimated 34 million gallons of acids, pesticides and other toxic materials before it was closed in 1972. The panel ruled the state was liable because it supervised construction of the toxic landfill, delayed cleanup activities and allowed a dangerous condition to exist on public property. The jurors also found the state liable for maintaining a nuisance and breaching its duty to deal with toxic contamination, but ruled the state was not negligent in choosing or designing the site in the early 1950s, or for failing to remedy the toxic contamination. The decision pleased lawyers for <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, owner of the quarry that contained the dump and 14 users of the landfill who were all found liable to share cleanup costs by <PERSON> Ideman </PERSON>. `` We believe the implications of today's ruling is that the state will bear the lion's share,'' said attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON>, 62, of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> said he was delighted with the jury's decision. `` I feel better,'' he said. `` It's the first time anyone had heard my story.'' Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the verdict favored the state because it rejected the plaintiffs' claims the state was negligent in choosing and designing the dumpsite, and that it allegedly failed to remedy problems that became apparent in the 1970s. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> hinted that an appeal was possible, saying that he felt the jury would not have found the state liable at all if retired judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Peetris </PERSON>, who presided over the fact-finding hearing, had not refused to instruct the jury on several legal defenses possibly applicable to the state. `` It is the opinion of the attorney general's office that these defenses would have barred any finding of liability against the state on the portion of the verdict that dealt with those theories,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. During the two-month proceeding, Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> told the jury operators of the Stringfellow site were to blame because they allegedly failed to follow design specifications in a key area of the dump site. The alleged error allowed toxic materials to overflow barriers and spread into groundwater supplies, she said. Stringfellow attorney <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisgaard </PERSON> said his client initially balked at the idea of putting the toxic dump on his property but relented after state officials allegedly promised to help build and operate the dump. <PERSON> Bisgaard </PERSON> said state geologists erroneously determined in 1955 that the quarry was located above an impermeable granite bedrock suitable for safe dumping. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Rohr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, one of the companies that dumped chemicals at the Stringfellow site, said the jury decision shifted blame from companies that merely accepted state assurances the site was safe. `` We were found liable without having done anything wrong,'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said.

 An audio tape played in a courtroom Friday featured a copilot saying `` That's a gun,'' following the sounds of shots fired aboard a commuter jetliner that crashed in 1987, killing all 43 people aboard. Jurors heard the pilot and copilot groan loudly after apparent gunfire in the final moments preceding the crash of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight blamed on a gun-toting former airline employee bent on revenge after he was fired for on-the-job theft. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> is alleged to have smuggled a .44 - caliber Magnum aboard Flight 1771 on Dec. 7, 1987 by flashing his employee badge at a security gate and bypassing metal Relatives of eight passengers and two crew members are suing <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION> and a security company, contending they were negligent in allowing <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> to board the jet bound for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> with a loaded gun. The airline, airport agency and <ORGANIZATION> Ogden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> contend <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> was solely responsible for the fatal crash. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> was an employee of <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION>, until he was fired by a man he allegedly shot in the passenger section of the plane before he entered the cockpit and fired on the flight crew. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a pilot and former air traffic controller, testified as an expert witness for the plaintiffs using a recording of the cockpit crew's conversation with an air traffic controller in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. The tape began with the sound of a possible gunshot. Pilot: `` My God!'' -LRB- Sound of second shot. -RRB- Copilot: `` That's a gun.'' Pilot: `` Yeah, I know. Tell'em we got a problem.'' Copilot: -LRB- Sending distress signal. -RRB- Unknown crew member: `` We've got a problem. We've had a gun fired. Are they on board the aircraft?'' Air Controller: `` I beg your pardon.''

I asked for some leniency for my family ... Well, I got none and you'll get none.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wecht </PERSON>, attorney for the plaintiffs, said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> bought about $ 350,000 in flight insurance from a terminal vending machine before boarding the airliner.

 While some city slickers may think real cowboys are an endangered species, cowboy poets know better. Sixteen cowboy poets participated in Friday's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cowboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symposium </ORGANIZATION> and Celebration, reciting verses about bull riding, the cowboy's changing way of life and the barren land they try to tame. `` As long as there are cows and people eat hamburgers, there will be cowboys and my audience will exist,'' said <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who quit his work as a cattleman and veterinarian in the early 1980s to become a full-time cowboy poet. The poems were melancholy and humorous; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON>'s had plenty of whimsy. One verse was about a dream of a scientifically enhanced steer with `` eyes a big a truck headlights, each horn weighed a thousand pounds.'' `` Cowboy poetry is looking at our flaws and foible and laughing at ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. `` I try to nudge that fine line between good taste and throwing up in your hat.'' Black recites his poems, which run as long as 10 minutes, from memory almost effortlessly. However, on a recent appearance on the <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> show, he was so nervous he considered using a TelePrompTer. `` But I decided, no, that's not the cowboy way,'' he said.

 Noted artist <PERSON> Erte </PERSON> will collect big money in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but not by gambling. `` I am bored by gambling,'' the master of art deco design said. Instead, <PERSON> Erte </PERSON> will exhibit and sell some of his private collection in a casino ballroom tonight. In his suite at <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> and Casino this week, the 96-year-old artist was signing special exhibit books for high rollers who are invited to see and bid on Erte's special exhibit. On Sunday, the exhibit will be open to the public and available for purchase. The collection includes 50 original watercolors, some up to 80 years old. It will also feature some of Erte's distinctive sculptures and jewelry and a costume recently designed by the artist for the new Broadway musical `` Stardust.'' Born <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirtoff </PERSON>, the artist took the name Erte from his initials. Today, the tiny white-haired man, who designs his own suits and chunky jewelry, smiled when asked if he has any favorites among his pieces. `` They are all my children and I am their father,'' he said. But he admitted to some affection for one abstract sculpture in his <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> flat, titled `` Autumn.'' `` I will never give it away because it is the center of my decorations,'' he said. The artist said he has created almost 20,000 designs, mostly of women bedecked in elaborate outfits. And Erte's mind and paintbrushes keep flowing. `` Retirement is to die, and I do n't want to die,'' he said. `` I will retire when I die.'' Erte, who is building a new home in <LOCATION> Majorca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, has spent most of his years in a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> apartment, said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Estorick </PERSON>, managing director of the <LOCATION> Grosvenor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gallery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Erte </PERSON>'s exclusive world agent `` There have been five different owners of his flat who spent years waiting for him to die,'' <PERSON> Estorick </PERSON> said, chuckling. <PERSON> Erte </PERSON> keeps living a full life, traveling around the world to exhibits and designing costumes and scenery for upcoming theater productions. `` I always make the complete package for a show,'' he said. `` I hate to make costumes for someone else's setting. If one painter makes the background and one the costumes, it's not art, it's an accommodation.'' The end results are richly colored costumes and headpieces melding with spectacular background effects. <PERSON> Erte </PERSON> said he first started drawing at age 3. At 6, he drew an evening dress that his mother later had a dressmaker copy for her to wear. Years later, from 1915 to 1937, he created covers and illustrations for <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s Bazaar. He never married, yet he has created thousands of dreamlike images of women, with inspiration that he said comes from heaven. <PERSON> Estorick </PERSON> said <PERSON> Erte </PERSON> `` is not only a meticulous creator, but unlike fashion designers, he is a basic designer and an artist. Other designers have to bring in artists to flesh out their ideas.'' Even with `` the foibles of old age _ rheumatic problems and old teeth _ the fact is that <PERSON> Erte </PERSON> is a discipline machine. He always is a no-nonsense, hard-working artist,'' <PERSON> Estorick </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Official Says $1.6 Trillion in Pension Funds Potentially at Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government watchdog says $ 1.6 trillion in private pension funds are subject to potential fraud and abuse because of loose regulations and lax enforcement of federal pension laws. Labor Department Inspector General <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> said in a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that the problems that leave the pension system open to abuse are much like those that triggered the savings and loan crisis. Unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acts quickly to strengthen the laws and require the government to improve oversight of pension funds the potential exists for a `` nightmare'' that would dwarf the S & amp; L crisis, <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> said in the report. `` As, unfortunately, has been demonstrated by the recent savings and loan crisis, government regulation of an industry does not ensure that invested assets are protected,'' he said. The report drew immediate criticism, however, from a research group that follows employee benefit programs and from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> itself, which said the pension laws have been strengthened in recent years and are under constant review. `` I think he is very dramatically overstating any problems,'' said <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. He said that as a result of the 1974 law governing pensions, `` the funded status of the private pension system has improved dramatically in each of the last 15 years.'' Also, a spokeswoman for the federal agency that insures private pension funds said <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> appeared to be exaggerating the government's _ and taxpayer's _ potential liability in the event of a major pension funding crisis, the likelihood of which she said was `` remoter than remote.'' But <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON>, while not alleging any specific abuses, said existing laws and regulations allow employers and pension fund managers to hide abuses from the government. He said understaffing at the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> leaves the government little chance to catch offenders. The department, <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> said, has just 300 people to monitor and enforce the nation's central pension law and lacks a system to detect when reports pension funds are required to file are delinquent. Permissive regulations allow fund administrators and their accountants to omit from reports information that could alert the government to fraud, abuse and mismanagement, said the inspector general. <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> said his and other reviews of enforcement of the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act have found `` a striking number of parallels'' to the current savings and loan crisis, particularly in the failure of managers and private accountants to pinpoint and report significant management and operations problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attacked that assertion, saying: `` The analogy between the S & amp; L crisis and <ORGANIZATION> ERISA </ORGANIZATION> is a faulty one. On the one hand over recent years S & amp; Ls were largely deregulated while pension rules have become more stringent.'' But <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> said the $ 100 billion the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates it will cost <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayers to rescue savings and loans would appear a bargain should a similar crisis wrack a significant number of the nation's 870,350 private pension funds and a sizable portion of their $ 1.6 trillion in assets _ $ 7,000 for every man, woman and child in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The burden of insuring and protecting failed benefit plans will fall upon all taxpayers, not just plan beneficiaries and parties, since the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guarantee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is the final insurer of these plan assets,'' <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> said. `` Unless steps are taken now, today's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout may become tomorrow's ERISA nightmare.'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoden </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the pension guaranty corporation, said the agency believed the protections of ERISA, while not abuse-free, were strong enough to prevent a crisis in the private pension system. `` Most pension plans are well managed and well funded,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hoden </PERSON> said. `` The likelihood of something like that happening is remoter than remote.'' In the unlikely event of a total or near-total collapse of the private pension system, PGBC would be liable for its assets plus its line of credit with the federal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, now $ 100 million, Ms. <PERSON> Hoden </PERSON> said. The agency's assets now total $ 2.6 billion and are expected to top $ 10 billion in the next decade, she said. The government is not bound to back the agency beyond the limits of the credit line _ unlike its responsibility to cover all insured bank deposits if the government agencies that insure them run short of cash, Ms. <PERSON> Hoden </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>USDA Allows Haying, Grazing on Conservation Set-Aside Land</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is opening up millions of acres of erosion-prone land for hay cutting and livestock grazing to help farmers in drought-stricken areas. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced the assistance on Friday, saying producers in more than 500 counties in 16 states currently could be eligible. `` Livestock producers have exhausted stocks of hay that were carried into winter, and they are now faced with another dry spring,'' Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` So they're out of hay and short of grass. The land being made available is part of a conservation reserve program that pays people to take their most erosion-prone land out of production for at least 10 years and improve it by planting grasses and trees. The haying assistance would be authorized county by county in states where a livestock emergency has been declared, currently 16 states, mostly in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. Tighter restrictions would be placed on livestock grazing on the so-called CRP acres. It would be allowed only after a visual inspection of the land by the <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to ensure it would not suffer any damage. The 16 states are: <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.

Additional counties and states could become eligible later. As of last year, 28 million acres nationwide _ 19 million of those in the 16 states _ had been enrolled in the conservation reserve program, which was established by the 1985 farm law as a way to reduce erosion and trim overproduction on marginal land. The government paid $ 1.4 billion in yearly rental payments to producers participating in the program. Friday's announcement is the latest federal aid made available to farmers facing crop and livestock losses from lingering drought conditions. It followed <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> earlier this week and earlier visits to <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> last month authorized livestock grazing and hay cutting on land taken out of production under this year's commodity programs, but put off a decision on conservation reserve acreage. In addition, livestock and poultry producers have been allowed to buy surplus government-owned grain at discount prices. These restrictions will apply to the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> assistance: _ Rental payments to producers next year will be cut 50 percent for those who cut hay or graze livestock Nationwide, annual payments averaged $ 48 an acre last year. _ No <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> land with grasses planted after July 1, 1987, will be eligible _ Only one hay cutting will be allowed, and none permitted after July 15 At least three inches of stubble must be left, and a one-fourth of each field must be left untouched to provide cover for wildlife. _ Local <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> operations will determine how long grazing will be permitted on <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> land as well as the number of livestock No grazing will be allowed after Aug. 1.

 The Veterans Affairs Department is reducing its home mortgage interest rates by half a percentage point, a move that could save purchasers more than $ 300 a year on a typical <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> loan of $ 75,000. Effective Monday, the maximum interest rate for the federally backed loans will drop to 10 percent. It is the first change in the VA rate since Dec. 19, when the rate rose from 10 percent to 10.5 percent. VA home loans may be used to purchase, improve or refinance a home or condominium and to purchase or refinance a manufactured home. Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said the action `` reflects continued investor confidence in the economy as well as current financial market conditions in which investors are willing to accept lower yields on long-term investments.'' The department said that effective Monday, a variety of other mortgage rates also will fall by a half-point. The maximum rate for graduated-payment mortgages will fall to 10.25 percent; home improvement loans, 11.5 percent; manufactured home loans, 12.5 percent; manufactured home lot-only loans, 12 percent; and manufactured home and lot loans, 12 percent.

 Most savings and loan associations will have to increase the amount of capital they keep in reserve, the government says.

<HEAD>Dispute With Bar Over Judicial Selection Settled, Thornburgh Says</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> may have too much influence in the selection of federal judges, a position that puts him in partial agreement with conservative critics. `` In some respects, the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s standing committee has become larger than life,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said Friday at a hearing of his committee. He was referring to the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary. `` Surely the -LRB- Judiciary -RRB- committee has over the years, given the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> standing committee an exalted status,'' he said. But <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> also said that the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s opinion on judges was sought in the past because `` cronyism and not competence was all too often the reason for choosing a nominee.'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> spoke the same day that Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told reporters he considered his dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> over judicial selection to be settled. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told reporters he regarded an agreement reached with the bar group last month `` to be dispositive of this issue.'' Conservative senators have been smoldering ever since four of the standing committee's 15 members voted to find then-Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> unqualified for a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Joined by a number of other lawmakers, conservative senators have been calling for an overhaul or even an end to the process under which the committee meets behind closed doors and does not explain how it arrives at its conclusions or how the individual committee members voted. The system, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, `` is a moldering, corrupted, malodorous old relic which should be given a quick burial for the sake of public health.'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> it `` is no longer appropriate that this one private organization be granted a status not accorded to any other group.'' `` It exercises a virtual veto over judicial nominees,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. But Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, scoffed at what he called conservative concerns over the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s liberal focus. He said he had been an <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> member for decades and `` there's no question about it _ I would put the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> on the conservative side.'' `` Who are you kidding?'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said. `` This is the hierarchy of all the big corporate law firms in the country.'' Under the new agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>, the group promised to drop a disputed paragraph from a brochure outlining its methods of reviewing potential nominees for the federal bench. The paragraph to be erased says: `` Political or ideological philosophy are not considered, except to the extent that they may bear upon other factors.'' Far from barring consideration of politics, critics say, the paragraph specifically opens the door to such inquiries. <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> officials also promised to refrain from weighing the ideology and political philosophy of potential candidates for judge whose names are sent to it for review by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. The officials, however, made a point of adding they had never considered those factors in their evaluations. Names of potential federal judges are sent to the president by senators and other influential officials. Before they are nominated by the president, they are evaluated by the administration and investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1953, the government also has maintained an arrangement under which potential candidates are screened by the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>, the major professional association of the nation's lawyers, before the president sends their names to Capitol Hill for confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Scientists Re-examining Possible Geological Fault at Nevada Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is taking a second look at the possibility of a geological fault near the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> site where the nation's first permanent dump for high-level nuclear waste is planned. The department, which previously had concluded there was no such fault, sent a team of scientists to <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> last month to review existing data on the question `` to make sure we did n't overlook something,'' department spokeswoman Ginger King said Friday. The review was prompted by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which raised questions about the department's decision to dismiss a 1982 study that reported the possible fault, said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gertz </PERSON>, manager of the <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> project, the name for the planned dump. `` There does n't appear to be a fault,'' <PERSON> Gertz </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, but it's not possible to know for sure until the department begins actual digging work. That work ca n't start until <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> grants certain permits, he said. The site borders the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site, where underground nuclear tests are conducted. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve a license for the waste repository, also recommended more extensive study on whether the site contains significant amounts of gold, <PERSON> Gertz </PERSON> said. Any gold mining activity could disrupt the repository, but <PERSON> Gertz </PERSON> said preliminary <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> studies indicated no significant amounts of any valuable minerals at the site, which is about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. He said additional studies were planned, but that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> wanted even more. The dump is intended to entomb 70,000 tons of highly radioactive waste from commercial nuclear reactors and from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear weapons plants. Numerous sites were under consideration early in the decade, but in 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decreed that the search would be limited to <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> state government strongly objects to the project and has accused the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of disregarding the 1982 study that said there may be an uncharted fault parallel to the Ghost Dance Fault, which cuts through the site. In a letter to <PERSON> Gertz </PERSON> on Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the 1982 report contains `` strong evidence'' of a fault intersecting the area where two exploratory shafts would be drilled. Earthquakes could destabilize the holes. The state contends that if the additional fault were confirmed it would disqualify <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> as a waste dump because the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s site criteria rule out sites with underground facilities closer than 100 feet from a fault. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> raised a similar point, according to <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagner </PERSON>, a commission spokeswoman. She said the department was told in a meeting in early May that `` it looks like they may be violating their own criteria.'' She said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> would publish a lengthy analysis of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s preliminary site study in July. <PERSON> Gertz </PERSON> said a team of researchers would spend the next two months reviewing all the existing scientific data on the possible existence of an uncharted fault, but that the key to ending the debate was getting started with exploratory drilling. `` Rather than rehash all their old data we want to get on the mountain,'' he said. King said Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had begun reviewing the project plans and schedules in light of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s objections and a series of delays in the program that have drawn the ire of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the nuclear utility industry. She said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had not yet come to any conclusions about possible changes.

 His television campaign ridicules his prominent ears as `` disquieting, even fatal.'' Known as the man Poles love to hate, polls show he is trailing his Solidarity-backed candidate by a 7-1 margin in the race for a seat in parliament in Sunday's balloting. He is <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, the loyal government spokesman for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist authorities since 1981 Urban was the point man for seven years in the government's campaign against the Solidarity union movement And he was among the first government officials to announce his candidacy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first democratic elections since World War II. In his usually provocative manner Urban, who is now information minister, is running as an independent. The Sejm, or parliament, has 460 seats and 161 are open to opposition candidates, including independents. The other seats are reserved for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies. As government spokesman, Urban gave his first news conference in December 1981 on the day the government imposed martial law and suppressed Solidarity. The independent union movement subsequently was outlawed but was legalized again in April following negotiations that also set the framework for Sunday's elections. Over the years Urban belittled Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as the `` former head of a former union.'' Now he is running for a <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> seat in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s center-city district against <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapicki </PERSON>, a Soviet-endorsed actor. Opposition polls show Urban to be a heavy underdog. But the results could be affected by the large number of ballots expected to be cast by Poles abroad. The district has about 140,000 eligible voters, but some 600,000 Poles abroad, including many embassy and government contract workers, also will have their ballots counted in the district. Urban was promoted to information minister on April 17, the day Solidarity became legal again. As government spokesman he conducted weekly news conference that were televised and gave him a national audience. He frequently would mention polling data showing more than half of the population disapproved of him, but his news conferences were the highest rated weekly show on television. In the first few days of the campaign the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> had so many articles concerning Urban that one letter writer told the editors to avoid `` Urbanophobia.'' <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, an Urban aide, said of the polls: `` Urban is in a better situation than other candidates because he is a well-known person and does not have to introduce himself to the public like the others, so it is a big advantage. Ninety-six percent of people questioned said they knew who Urban was.'' Urban is a journalist and satirist who was associated with Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> weekly Polityka. He mocks his distinctive appearance _ a small man with a circular bald pate and large ears. In a program on state television, controlled by Urban as information minister, a singer sang, `` Strange ears had he, strange hears had he,'' while Urban was shown as a child, teen-ager and young man. Video-writing drew circles around his ears to make them look even larger. In a country where many politicians are rigid and humorless, Urban recently told a campaign rally, `` Everyone knows who I am.''

<TEXT>
 A divided <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gathered today to discuss an extraordinary proposal: disbanding this neutral nation's 625,000-member army. About 1,000 delegates were to decide the party's official stand in a Nov. 26 national referendum on dismantling the army. The proposal for unlateral disarmament is given no chance at the polls, but the Socialists' position on it could have an impact on the country's 30-year-old coalition government. The proposal has drawn fierce reactions from the Socialists' three center-right partners in a governing alliance often cited as a prime factor in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s political stability A leader of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Blocher </PERSON>, has said an anti-army decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> should spell the end of the government coalition. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s army has not fought a foreign war for five centuries but Western military experts have rated it as one of the world's best-trained and most highly motivated forces. The Socialists' right wing and trade union leaders were seeking a resolution to keep the army. The left wing was inclined toward dismantling the army. Party President <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubacher </PERSON> predicted that the meeting, which was to open in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> today, would decide not to issue a recommendation. That, too, would provoke criticism from the center-right. The anti-army proposal was authored by socialists and religious pacifists. They collected 113,000 signatures backing a proposed amendment to the federal constitution saying `` <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> has no army'' and deleting all references to defense needs. Under the system of direct democracy in this nation of 4.2 million voters, the signatures were enough to force a nationwide vote. Even supporters admit the proposal has no chance of winning and was mainly meant as a pro-disarmament demonstration. But it has posed a predicament for the Socialists, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s second-largest political party, ever since being officially submitted three years ago In its platform, the party endorses <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s armed neutrality but it has a record of being critical about the defense budget and procurement plans. <PERSON> Hubacher </PERSON>, 63, a former infantry private, urged unsuccessfully a clear position against the proposal, which he called `` a rotten egg.'' `` It is an illusion to think we should set an example and disarm,'' he said in an interview. `` It is not we who are a threat to the world but the big powers.'' The two Socialist members of the seven-member federal executive, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Felber </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Stich </PERSON>, also have spoken against the proposal. Senior party members warned that supporting the proposal would boost conservative groups that split from the main party in recent years. But warnings have not stemmed a surprisingly strong pacifist groundswell in the party, particularly among the young and in urban regions. At the special congress, the party's future defense concept is the only point on the agenda. Recent public opinion polls suggest that about one of four voters might sympathize with the `` zero option.'' Women appear to oppose disbanding the army more than men, though feminist groups favor the proposal. Polls are not always reliable in multilingual, multicultural <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. But even the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zuercher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in a recent editorial conceded a `` declining trend'' in popular support of the army. Protests have been growing against low-flying combat planes, projects to expand army exercise grounds, and noise from mandatory regular target practice by militia members at the country's 2,500 shooting ranges. But most Swiss remain opposed to a farewell to arms in the country where the military has a long tradition. `` I understand every voting citizen who may be tempted to use this occasion for venting personal anger at the army or the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Kaspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiger </PERSON> was quoted as telling the independent <PERSON> Basler </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON> newspaper. `` But this time, we are closely watched from abroad. And therefore it is particularly important to make plain as firmly as possible that we remain committed to armed neutrality and to the defense of our country.''

 The man likely to succeed <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker believes both parties are tired of partisan mudslinging and is pledging to use his ties to Democrats and Republicans to improve the atmosphere in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., spoke critically Friday of the ethics war sweeping <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in recent months But <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, known as a consensus builder, also praised the work of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which comprises six Democrats and six Republicans. `` The committee has won a broad degree of public respect in the manner in which it's handled the difficult issues before it,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` What we are talking about is the use of ethics issues as a tool or instrument of recrimination, partisanship. `` It's not the ethics committee, it's the members on either side who are trying to come up with some concept of abusive charges.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, said members of both parties are guilty of using ethics issues for recrimination and partisanship. `` I think the vast majority of members on both sides of the aisle are tired of that sort of tactic,'' he told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> headquarters following a private luncheon with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrats. The 60-year-old <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he hopes to restore the public's confidence and mutual respect in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` We have to reach out on both sides of the aisle to try and change the mood of bitterness, which exists to some degree, and hard feelings, which exist to some degree in both parties, and get back to a mood of mutual respect and conciliation which can, and must be, the basis of any effective parliamentary body,'' he said. First elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1964, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has been described by colleagues in both parties as the ideal leader to bring a bipartisan spirit back to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of resignations by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> provided no specifics on how he plans to fight resentments and abuses in both parties But he said he hopes to create a task force to examine issues like the code of conduct, ethical standards and whether to limit or abolish fees representatives receive for speeches and appearances. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> recently acknowledged that he failed to report a loan from a savings and loan whose chief executive helped set him up in a junk bond deal. He said last week he is quitting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rather than endure an ethics investigation like the one that felled <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned Wednesday following a yearlong, $ 1.5 million investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee that led to charges he violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in 69 instances.

<HEAD>Iowa Crewman's Friend Recalls Talk of Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sailor who survived the USS Iowa explosion says he heard his friend and crewmate talk of suicide but never of blowing up a ship. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier Friday that investigators of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> explosion are focusing on <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, who was one of the 47 sailors to die in the blast April 19. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was often despondent and aloof, and that he reportedly told a witness, `` If you've got to go, go in a blast. You go quick. You go painless.'' But <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s friend, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' that he did n't take <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s talk of suicide seriously. `` The way he described, you know, killing himself would have been just simply -LRB- to -RRB- walk off the ship,'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said. `` He never talked about an explosion.'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said he remembered that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> `` was a little down, but it was over a year and a half ago. He had at one point -LRB- talked about suicide -RRB- but it was n't very serious. ... I think we all talk about suicide at least once in our life, and at the time the divisions were razzing him about how close friends we were.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, 25, was the last man to touch the gunpowder that exploded in the ship's second turret on April 19. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reported a witness told investigators that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> showed off a $ 15 timer available in hobby stores and said that if it were rigged to a battery it could set off the ship's gunpowder and start a chain of explosions. But <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, said on `` Nightline'' that he believed the explosion may have been caused by an inexperienced crew working with gunpowder that he contended was unstable because it was stored improperly. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators said the gunpowder had been stored at unusually high temperatures at one point. But they also said that would not have affected its stability. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> also said he had talked to an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crewman who remembered hearing someone say shortly before the blast, `` Tell them we're not ready yet.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said he could not comment on the network report, and expressed regret that leaks about the investigation were distressing relatives and ship's crew. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> could have inserted a homemade detonator between bags of gunpowder in the breech of the turret's center 16-inch gun, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> explosive experts have successfully tested a similar timing device in a simulation, the network added. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> also reported that a witness told investigators that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> had shown him a timing device and said words to the effect that he could blow the ship up. The network said no remnants of a timer were found, but firefighting may have washed them away. Investigators reportedly said such a device could have given off smoke or made a noise that could have served as a warning to other sailors. It had been known earlier that the last words of sailor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, spoken into a internal ship telephone, were, `` We've got a problem in here.'' A different voice was heard saying something that sounded like `` smoke smoke smoke, help help,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said. Many sailors' bodies were found in defensive positions, hunched over with their arms covering their heads, the network said. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said investigators found that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> had written letters that spoke of his death and the destruction of the second turret. The network quoted sources as saying they believed <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> lived in a fantasy world and told relatives of an upcoming transfer to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said he had not been given. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was heard by two other sailors as saying immediately after the blast, `` I ca n't believe he actually did it.'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said on `` Nightline'' that he did not recall making such a statement and added, `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> -RRB- never talked about blowing up a ship or anything.'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for an apology for linking his name to the criminal investigation of the explosion. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said Friday at a news conference, `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> wants to reveal it they will, and they're going to; he's going to be cleared.'' Responding to <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>'s comments, <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said Friday night, `` How can we clear him? We have n't accused him of anything.'' He read from a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> statement that said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recognizes with regret the additional anguish press reports from some unidentified sources have placed on the families of deceased <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> shipmates as well as the crew itself. `` We wish to assure these families the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> remains committed to a thorough and complete investigation and hopes that a responsible public understands the need for discretion until all the factors can be amassed and evaluated.'' <PERSON> Baumann </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>'s comments were `` the gist of why we're putting this out.

<HEAD>State Department Official Backs Away From Testimony on Honduras Aid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official is backtracking from his denial that a plan was carried out to link aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> with help to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman says he will ask more questions about the plan. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, testified on April 25 that the `` plan was disapproved, at the objection of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, on the grounds that conditionality _ linkage between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance and any -LRB- Honduran -RRB- assistance to the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- resistance _ was contrary to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. policy.'' `` The whole proposed linkage that was included in -LRB- the -RRB- plan was disapproved, was not made, there was no ` discreet emissary,''' <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations chaired by Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>. But in a letter to Obey this week, <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said, `` I certainly did not intend to imply by these statements, however, that decisions to provide assistance to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on an expedited basis were not thereafter made or carried out.'' <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> had testified that an admission of facts agreed to by both sides and used in former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial was misleading. Among other trial documents was a Feb. 1985 memo initialed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and approving a plan to link more than $ 110 million in extra aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' support for the Contra rebels. Then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and met with President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he did not discuss any possible quid pro quo with <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON>. After examining the secret documents used to draw up the admission of facts, <PERSON> Obey </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> that his testimony did not seem to jibe with the documents. Obey said Friday that <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> wrote back to say, `` Because I am responding from the perspective of the department and my own personal knowledge, I can not speak to documents from other agencies or the thoughts and actions of persons other than myself.'' A separate letter to Obey from Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said, `` Information about non-departmental personnel and activities should be sought from other, appropriate sources'' which she did not specify. Obey said <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>'s letter to him `` seemed to indicate that his original testimony left the wrong impression.'' `` His letter, without specifically reversing that, simply said, ` I'm sorry if we left the impression that the plan was not carried out,''' Obey said. Obey said he believed `` there's absolutely no question that it was carried out. The documents laid out the plan ... the additional assistance we know did arrive.'' <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>'s letter will lead to more questions that will be addressed both to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the White House, including questions about aid to other Central American countries, Obey said. Last month, Obey threatened to hold up $ 700 million in aid for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> unless administration officials concede they misled lawmakers about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to win third-country help for the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> did not return a message left at his home phone Friday night.

 Chinese riot police fired tear gas Saturday on crowds near <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in a renewed attack against pro-democracy students occupying the central square. Witnesses also reported at least 30 people were beaten by police outside the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Hotel. About 700 to 800 riot police used tear gas to clear an area around the entrance to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters at <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION>, just west of the square. They also attacked students and others with truncheons. About 5,000 troops, meanwhile, confronted and were quickly surrounded by crowds outside the Great Hall of the People who were defying martial law restrictions imposed last month by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. The troop advance came hours after larger contingents of soldiers were driven back by throngs of people who implored the soldiers not to crush the student-led movement for democractic reform that began in mid-April. On the west side of the Great Hall, opposite from the square, crowds quickly grew into the thousands and blocked the troops from advancing onto <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the main street running past the square. A city bus was moved in front of the troops to impede their advance. Large crowds stood on top of the bus and inside it. About a half-mile to the west, near <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION>, students and others were throwing rocks at riot police, who were armed with truncheons and knives. One man, his chest bloodied, said he had been beaten by police. Chinese witnesses said riot police also battled crowds shortly after noon outside the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, to the east of the square. They said about 30 people have been beaten by police carrying truncheons before the police had left the area and headed toward the north, away from the square. Meanwhile, an official report said three people were killed when struck by a police car in an accident Friday night. Students linked the deaths to their demonstrations and called for a general strike in protest. Troops on Saturday moved against students whose defiance of martial law and occupation of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s vast square for weeks have spurred a power struggle among <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s rulers. The military advances began about midnight and ended in disarray. More than eight hours later, soldiers still straggled away from the city center to the outskirts, where about 200,000 soldiers were reportedly camped. Soldiers advanced down <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the capital's main road, but thousands of students and residents used trucks, buses and their bodies to stop them in front of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, several hundred yards east of the square. Other troop convoys coming from other directions also were halted. The middle of the square remained calm, with the `` Ode to Joy'' from <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Ninth Symphony blaring over student loudspeakers. More than 2,000 people surrounded two unmarked buses, one carrying about 40 soldiers and the other supplies including automatic rifles, 1.2 miles west of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. Some of the people broke into the supply vehicle and removed several automatic rifles, one equipped with a bayonet, and displayed the weapons on a table set up on top of the bus. A banner draped on the bus read, `` These are the angels of peace sent by <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> government to protect the people of the capital.'' The crowd alternately cheered and jeered the soldiers as they moved away from the square. Shouts of `` What do you think you're doing? and `` Are you of the people?'' filled the balmy night. Said one soldier: `` If I'm going to die I want to die on the battlefield, not on Changan Avenue.'' Earlier, about 3,000 student bicyclists headed from the square to protest an incident in which a police vehicle ran into a crowd. The bicyclists turned back when they heard that advancing troops were seen on the other side of the square. Government-run <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that three people were killed in the accident. The official <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Saturday that two people were killed and two were seriously injured. The newspaper said the police car was traveling too fast on wet pavement but gave no other details. Witnesses said the accident occurred at about 11 p.m. Friday. They were not the first deaths linked to the demonstrations. It was reported about two weeks ago that a soldier was killed in a traffic accident involving troop movements connected to the protests. The <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, in an announcement on the square, called for a general strike and a demonstration later Saturday to protest the deaths. About 300,000 people crowded into <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on Friday evening when <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Te-chien </PERSON>, a singer from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> who defected to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1983, and three others began a hunger strike atop the martyrs' monument in support of the students' 6-week campaign for democratic reforms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> declared martial law on May 20 to quell the burgeoning student-led protest movement, but the declaration only triggered greater support for the students. The number of student protests inside the square had declined dramatically in the past week, with about 10,000 maintaining a round-the-clock vigil. But Friday evening, huge masses again converged on the plaza, the symbolic heart of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The students, who have gained considerable support from ordinary citizens, are demanding more democracy, an end to official corruption. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, a reformer who advocated concessions to the students, has reportedly lost his post and is under house arrest.

 In 1980, five ardent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> environmentalists went on a hiking and camping trip into the <LOCATION> Pinacate </LOCATION> mountains of <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. When they returned, they had founded a radical activist movement _ Earth First! _ epitomized by a no-holds-barred slogan: `` No compromise in the defense of Mother Earth!'' With a clenched fist as its logo, Earth First! mounted letter-writing efforts, staged protests, filed suits, made threats and used theatrical and guerrilla tactics in a variety of battles against developers and the lumber and oil industries. The group has no formal structure, no official leaders, no officeholders, no dues, no bureaucracy. Just committed supporters. It has about 50 chapters worldwide, including the <LOCATION> Korago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tribe </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Solomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> where tribesmen burned a logging camp to the ground several years ago. Members adhere to the uncompromising philosophy espoused by the most highly profiled of its founders, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, who was arraigned Friday before a federal magistrate and charged with conspiracy to sabotage nuclear facilities in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. He was freed on a $ 50,000 bond. Three other Earth First! activists, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 39, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 37, and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Millett </PERSON>, 35, were ordered held without bail. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy; the other three face a count each of conspiracy and three types of property destruction. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Millett </PERSON> were committed to attacks on the <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> and Diablo Canyon nuclear complexes of <LOCATION> Wintersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, respectively, and the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> nuclear weapons center near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> testimony based on tape-recorded conversations. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Dokken </PERSON> told the federal magistrate that <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> was the ringleader. `` Mr. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> is the worst of the group,'' <PERSON> Dokken </PERSON> said. `` He sneaks around in the background. He was the financier, the leader, sort of the guru to get all of this going. I do n't like to use the analogy of a Mafia boss, but they never do anything either. They just send their munchkins out to do it.'' If convicted, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> faces five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine; the others each could be sentenced to 35 years and fined $ 80,000, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. Earth First! adheres to a concept called deep ecology, which maintains wilderness, endangered species and wild plants and creatures should be preserved for their own sake. In a December interview, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said the group's job is to challenge people to live up to higher standards. `` I think we redefined the debate,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>. `` The media had stopped covering the environment because it was boring. We made it interesting again.'' Demonstrations led by Earth First! included one at the Grand Canyon where members performed a skit in anti-radiation suits to protest against a proposed uranium mine. Members dressed as birds, squirrels and coyotes dropped dollar bills on federal <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials' heads during a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> hearing on flights over Grand Canyon. They also staged a `` die-in'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s now closed smelter in <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION>, where members wearing gas masks climbed the smokestacks in opposition to the air pollution it caused. There have been confrontations, such as where <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> put his chest against the front of a moving pickup truck in trying to block construction of a logging road in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Siskiyou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> published a book in 1985 titled `` Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkeywrenching,'' which reportedly has sold more than 11,000 copies. It is an illustrated and detailed primer on how to battle timber and land-developing interests. His book offers instructions on such actions as putting spikes into trees to discourage loggers with chain saws, knocking bulldozers and helicopters out of order by putting sand in engine oil, pulling up survey stakes and trap lines, downing billboards, cutting fences, closing wilderness-area roads and toppling power-line towers. Its genesis, and that of Earth First!, was a 1975 novel by the late <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON>, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Monkey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wrench </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION>,'' about a group of `` eco-raiders'' who unsuccessfully plot to blow up the <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION> that blocked the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and created <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> finds it altogether fitting to be shipping millions of books each year from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, the state with the highest illiteracy rate, to countries where books are a scarce commodity. Starting with a single shipment to <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> in 1983, <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> has sent more than 2 million books to countries in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Her non-profit company, <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, which has won <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> praise, operates from <LOCATION> Yazoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a small town 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> in the impoverished <LOCATION> Delta </LOCATION> area where she grew up. `` <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> seems an unlikely place for the exportation of books,'' <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> said, echoing comments she has heard time and again from book publishers, whom she approaches for donations, and from foreign embassies she contacts to determine which books are needed. The statement does n't bother her. `` It makes me feel special if I can dismantle stereotypes _ again,'' said <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON>, a black woman. <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON>, who obtained her doctorate in music at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, had completed a two-year education program at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 when she was approached by <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, the late founder of Books for the World. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, tapped <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> to take over the agency. Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has become the agency's honorary board chairman. An estimated 27 percent of adult Mississippians are functionally illiterate, the highest rate in the nation, and its school dropout rate is also among the highest. But in many Third World countries, even the literate often ca n't read. `` If there are people in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> who do n't have books, it's not because books are n't available It's a social problem,'' <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> said. At <LOCATION> Monrovia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> College </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, where she visited in 1983, <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> met students `` who had been to college, but had never had books they could take home and read.'' Sometimes a single textbook must serve a classroom full of students. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, leery of publishers who dump books in the Third World to turn print overruns into tax deductions, has helped <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> work in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` We felt there was a great need in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the initial shipments were very popular,'' said <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs. Books for the World asks foreign educators what kinds of books they need, then sends a sample copy of every title before shipping tons of books that are n't wanted, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> will take a two-week tour of 18 African countries beginning June 15, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in those countries have helped her make appointments with potential recipients. <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> said her office operates on a shoestring. Textbook publishers are approached for donations; corporations moving large shipments of merchandise are asked to slip in a load of books. Charitable groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> and World Vision that operate in the targeted countries help in distribution. Her office includes another full-time staffer and volunteers from a prison work-release program. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, education coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> last summer and wanted to find out how the center could ease the severe book shortage there. `` We made many, many phone calls to people to try to find out how to do this, find out about the problems we might encounter,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` We found out Books for the World has already put this into motion and has done very well with it.''

<HEAD>Solidarity, Gov't Tangle in Election Seen as Huge Gamble for Both</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> struggling to keep itself and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy afloat is competing against an invigorated Solidarity slate of candidates in an election seen as the freest in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in four decades. The elections Sunday for seats in the current one-house parliament and a new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are also viewed as a huge gamble for both sides. About 80 percent of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 27 million eligible voters are expected to vote. Campaigning ended Friday with Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> taping a television message and Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, the Polish leader, delivering a rare television address. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> urged restraint on both sides and said many people in the government were worried about the election's outcome. `` We are running very aggressively and proposing clear solutions,'' he said. `` A lot of people with other political concepts have not seen such a thing before, and they are scared.'' He said Solidarity and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> face `` hard work'' in finding solutions to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic and social problems. `` We are all learning on both sides,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` We should n't give way to emotions ... because emotion could destroy us.'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> made a similar appeal. `` This is first of all a dispute about <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, about what she will be like tomorrow, a year from now,'' he said. `` An intention to revile those representing different or independent views, a push for a crushing victory, this is not a good road. Playing with fire is not allowed. Choosing the road of hostility, tension and upheavals would be deadly to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' In apparent acknowledgment that Solidarity would win a great many seats, he called for a `` broad, post-election coalition.'' Party candidates and their allies are guaranteed 299 seats in the Sejm, or 65 percent. Solidarity candidates are contesting the other 161 seats and all 100 places in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which will be the first freely chosen legislative chamber in the communist world. For the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the results could reveal an embarrassing lack of popular support as it begins a four-year transition leading to democratic elections for the entire parliament. Solidarity could be hurt by apathy, particularly among the young, and may lose support when it enters the parliament and assumes at least some responsibility for the painful economic steps ahead. Whatever the risks, Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said Friday, `` It is a breakthrough because these elections are an institutionalization of the opposition, and the opposition as a political force.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who entered negotiations with authorities in February hoping to regain Solidarity's legal status, emerged two months later with the large step toward democracy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. He is not a candidate, but he is directing the opposition campaign. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> also is not running, but the government majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> is expected to elect him to the new office of president. During the campaign, candidates devoted little attention to the grim economic problems, which include probable sharp rises in food prices to encourage farmers to produce in an environment of 80 percent inflation. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s high foreign debt also is problematic _ $ 39 billion. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Czyrek </PERSON>, No. 2 in the Politburo, was asked in an interview Friday how much the party has changed with free elections. His reply: `` 180 degrees.'' <PERSON> Czyrek </PERSON> conceded Solidarity had a better chance at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority and expressed concern about well-known party figures running for uncontested seats in the Sejm. They will lose if they get less than 50 percent approval. Especially unnerving to the party is the possibility that voters may reject en masse the 35 prominent Communist or allied politicians on the unopposed `` national list'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>. It would be humiliating if people such as Czyrek, Premier <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> or Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> lost, although they would not be forced to leave office. Much of the last-minute party propaganda on state television has emphasized the `` national list'' includes those who agreed to the talks that legalized Solidarity and brought about the elections.

<HEAD>Negotiations Planned for Virginia No-Smoking Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where tobacco is king and the crop's green leaves cover the landscape in the summer, a law to restrict public smoking is almost unthinkable. But supporters of a statewide limit on lighting up cigarettes, cigars and pipes in stores, offices and other public places plan to meet with representatives of the tobacco industry next month in an unprecedented effort to reach a compromise over the failed clean indoor air bill of 1989. `` We did agree that there would be no smoking at the meeting,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Donley </PERSON>, executive director of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> GASP _ Group to Alleviate Smoking in Public. `` I think it's certainly historic that the tobacco industry is sitting down and talking with health groups about this.'' <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s regional director, said, `` We're willing to consider some type of restriction on public smoking at the statewide level in lieu of any additional ordinances at the local level.'' The industry that supports <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s leading agricultural crop mounted a massive offensive at the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session earlier this year to defeat a proposal to limit public smoking. The bill proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and Delegate <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> would have banned smoking in elevators and hospital emergency rooms and required no-smoking areas in large grocery stores and government buildings. But lawmakers, pressed by a $ 100,000-plus lobbying campaign by tobacco backers, turned down the plan and instead passed a one-year moratorium, effective July 1, on local no-smoking ordinances that apply to private industry. According to <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, anti-tobacco advocates are `` hounding'' local government bodies to adopt something before the July 1 cutoff. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved an ordinance that limits smoking in stores, theaters, restaurants and other public places. <ORGANIZATION> Portsmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is considering passing such an ordinance before July 1. About a dozen localities already have such regulations. Ms. <PERSON> Donley </PERSON> said she believes the tobacco industry would like to see the moratorium extended indefinitely. But she said business groups such as retailers, hotel and restaurant operators are keeping an open mind. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> said complaints that tobacco companies have been unyielding in opposition to smoking restrictions are unfair. `` We're always portrayed as the bad guy,'' he said. `` That's simply not true `` We're reasonable business people. Our product is legal and it makes a substantial contribution to the economy,'' he said. `` We're willing to meet with them and get down to trying to hammer out an accord. The meeting tentatively has been set for June 20 in the downtown <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> office of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Troy </PERSON>, a lawyer and former state attorney general who is a lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> said an industry-prepared draft of proposed legislation would be given to <PERSON> Michie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> at the meeting.

 The voluntary decision by <ORGANIZATION> Alar </ORGANIZATION>'s manufacturer to take the chemical off the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market drew praise from the nation's apple belt as the best way to win back consumers <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> continued to defend the chemical as safe, but said Friday that continued use on apples raised public doubts about the safety of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s food supply. The chemical has been labeled a possible carcinogen, although tests are continuing. `` We should be hopeful and expect this will be the beginning of restoring consumer confidence,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON>, a spokesman for Selah-based <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Top </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest apple juice maker. But other industry figures said the action is unlikely to help the current crop, which has turned into a financial disaster. Prices have fallen 40 percent, to below the cost of production, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state has 3.3 million more boxes of apples in storage than at this time last year. That includes an unknown quantity of Alar-treated apples that may have to be dumped. `` It wo n't make any difference for this year, but it certainly should help us as far as sales for next year's crop,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wenatchee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which charts apple sales. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state produces about half the nation's apples and has about 12 million of the 42-pound boxes in storage. Apple growers and processors nationwide had pleaded with Uniroyal to withdraw Alar. Public fears had cost each group an estimated $ 100 million in sales so far this year, industry groups estimate. The voluntary withdrawal by <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, means consumers will be guaranteed that this fall's apple crop will be Alar-free, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> State <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Sales of daminozide, which is sold under the name Alar, would continue to about 70 foreign markets, including some that export apples and apple products to this country, <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> said. Supplies of the chemical held by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers may be returned for refunds, the company said. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said late Friday it has reached agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> on a plan to monitor the removal of Alar from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, although it is still legal to use. The agency also said it will notify foreign governments about agency concerns about Alar. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has said it plans to ban use of daminozide in food products because tests in laboratory animals have linked a byproduct of Alar with cancer after the chemical is heated. Final action on the proposed regulation is not expected until late 1990. Uniroyal has disputed the findings and company Vice President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> said Friday: `` We want to emphasize that we have not changed our opinion about the safety of daminozide.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that from 5 percent to 15 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apple crop is treated with Alar, a growth regulator that improves the apple's appearance and gives it a longer shelf life. The Alar issue was ignited by the private <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s report that concluded that eating Alar-treated apples increased cancer risk, especially in children. The findings have been disputed by the apple industry and several federal agencies, including <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, declared apples safe to eat.

<HEAD>Most Expensive Freeway Segment Ever Built Opens</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With much fanfare, authorities Sunday are opening a seven-mile stretch of Interstate 90 that has the dubious distinction of being the most expensive segment of freeway ever built. It is part of a $ 1.46 billion highway project for the mushrooming <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> metropolis to build roads that probably will be badly congested by the time they are completed in 1994. For the time being, the new link between <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> brings welcome relief from the twice-daily creep across the lake's two existing four-lane spans that become jammed by fender-benders. Commuters also say goodbye to an infamous I-90 lane that switched direction depending on the commute. With no barrier to separate traffic, motorists tagged it the `` death lane.'' The completed segment includes a floating bridge, a triple-decker tunnel with one level for bicycles and pedestrians, and a concrete-slab roof over sections of the highway that will be landscaped as parks. The freeway, proposed in 1957, drew the wrath of residents, who wanted to protect neighborhoods, and of environmentalists. In 1971, planners agreed to scale back the project and build tunnels on the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> side of the lake, but an environmental impact statement was n't approved until 1979. By then, federal money had dried up, and it was n't until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> raised the gas tax in 1982 that funds became available. Construction began in earnest the next year. So far, $ 860 million has been spent. The balance of the money will go to reopening and linking up one of the old bridges, located to the south of the new structure, as well as other additions. At about $ 200 million a mile, the freeway has set a record for costliness, but one that will soon fall to a project at I-90's other terminus _ <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> project manager <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Henkel </PERSON> That $ 4.4 billion project will rebuild <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> 93 through downtown <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and construct a third harbor tunnel to link I-90 with <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Despite `` a major crisis every second day,'' <ORGANIZATION> Henkel </ORGANIZATION> said, he is on time and $ 16 million under budget. The project includes the world's largest soft-ground tunnel _ 1,500 feet long and 63 feet in diameter _ <ORGANIZATION> Henkel </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Henkel </ORGANIZATION> said he still sees vestiges of the rancor that surrounded the project. `` But now, it's almost opposite to the earlier emotion of ` make the freeway as difficult as possible to get on and maybe they wo n't build it,''' he said `` Now they say, ` I live in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and work on the Eastside and there's no way I can get on I-90 conveniently.'' <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has grown in the past two decades from small towns and farms to a suburban area of 360,000 people. Another 275,000 are expected by 2020, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, senior transportation planner for the <ORGANIZATION> Puget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governments </ORGANIZATION>. The county, which includes <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, has a population of about 1.4 million. Studies have shown the population of King and surrounding counties will grow by about 500,000 in the next decade.

 Brake failure may have caused a school bus to plunge off a mountain road, killing a sixth-grader and injuring 36 other schoolchildren, officials said.

Thirty-eight of the 800 books printed remained unaccounted for Friday night, <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> said. `` There were unacceptable captions and unacceptable stories,'' <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> said. `` There were sexual references and there was also bad taste and rather insulting remarks to the faculty.'' <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> said six of eight seniors who worked on the yearbooks apologized to faculty and staff Friday afternoon. Some parents accompanied the students, he said. `` I would say the faculty accepted the apology. As a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school we feel we are called to forgive those who ask for forgiveness,'' Welsh said. He said no disciplinary action would be taken against the six students. The Plain Dealer reported today the captions were apparently written after the yearbook's adviser had been injured in a car accident. The yearbook staffers later showed the adviser phony page proofs, which the teacher approved, then the students sent the real pages to the publisher, the newspaper said. There are 277 seniors among the 1,200 male students at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ignatius </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Venerable Ice Cream Parlor, Inventor of Hot Fudge Sundae, Tries Comeback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s, the venerable chain of ice cream parlors where the hot fudge sundae was invented, is trying to make a comeback under new ownership after a disastrous experiment in yuppie marketing. Last year, five of its seven stores closed, including the landmark location in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Harvard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where the mahogany paneling and marble table tops were ripped out for a pizzeria. The 116-year-old chain's former owner, <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Crugnale </PERSON>, admits he goofed in trying to remake <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s as an upscale spot for people in their 20s and 30s. `` It was a mistake from the beginning,'' he said. `` But I'm not ashamed of it. I learned a lot from it.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzaferro </PERSON>, one of three brothers who bought the business in November for an undisclosed price, said he hopes to reopen stores in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> within the next few years. `` I think the company lost its focus and it became more of a luncheon stop as opposed to an old-fashioned candy store and ice cream parlor,'' he said. `` We want to restore it to its roots.'' The <PERSON> Mazzaferro </PERSON> family, which has been making candy in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> since the 1950s, already is turning out <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s fudge at the rate of 20,000 pounds a year That would gladden the heart of <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON>, the bookkeeper to founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. When he retired in 1900, she became the shop's owner and took a gamble that made dessert history `` She put 6 ounces of ice cream in a 5-ounce dish and poured one and a half ounces of hot fudge on top of it, and it dripped down onto the silver dish,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s owner, said with reverence. `` Beautiful concept. Beautiful product.'' Later, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s supplied mail-order chocolates to <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, the late president's father, was among the many <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> brahmins who kept his candy preferences on record at the flagship store on Temple Place, at the edge of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Common. Shortly after <PERSON> Crugnale </PERSON> bought the chain in January 1987 for a reported $ 1.5 million, he announced plans to open more than 100 stores throughout <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in seven or eight years. But one of his first moves was to decide there was `` just no future'' in the old-fashioned menu of sandwiches like chopped ham and pickles, peanut butter and bacon, and datenut bread and cream cheese. Although `` little old ladies'' who had been faithful customers for decades implored him to reconsider, <PERSON> Crugnale </PERSON> said, he held firm. The entrepreneur, 37, had made a fortune with a yuppie, trendy, gourmet ice cream chain called <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>'s and a yuppie, trendy, gourmet pizza chain called <PERSON> Bertucci </PERSON>'s. So he ignored the old ladies and pulled the same trick with <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s. It did n't work. When <PERSON> Crugnale </PERSON> sold the chain to the Mazzaferros last fall, it was down to two stores, both in the suburbs. <PERSON> Crugnale </PERSON>, who had built <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>'s Ice Cream from one store to a national chain of 26 before selling out in 1983, says he was probably overconfident when he took over <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s. `` I thought I was superman _ I did <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>'s, I could do anything,'' he said. Though humbled by his failure with <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Crugnale </PERSON> has made a roaring success of <PERSON> Bertucci </PERSON>'s, now a chain of 12 pizzerias in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s was a business we should n't have been in,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Bertucci </PERSON>'s is one I'm much more comfortable with.''

 Haitian refugees threatened to throw babies overboard during an eight-hour standoff at sea before agreeing to board <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters, officials said. Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents Friday were interviewing 109 Haitians after flying to the scene about 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said the refugees brandished knives and machetes when their 50-foot wooden sailboat was intercepted Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. The refugees refused to let the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> board their boat, <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said, and the group's leader threatened to throw five babies overboard. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters Shearwater and <PERSON> Matagorda </PERSON> were sent out to help a third cutter, the Metompkin, which made the interception. During the standoff, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> agents and an interpreter were airlifted to the scene.

Two of the Haitians were airlifted from the scene to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Jackson Memorial Hospital One was suffering from hypothermia, <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said, and the other appeared to have suffered a seizure.

 Wages are down, work hours are up and vacations are out at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which announced an austerity program designed to help the strike-crippled company rebuild from bankruptcy. Eastern said Friday it will eliminate vacations for the rest of the year, cut management pay by 20 percent and require non-union employees to work 50 hours a week for 40 hours of pay. Meanwhile, a judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gave an investor group friendly with striking employees until Monday afternoon to refine a buyout proposal. The group is led by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>'s decree surprised observers who thought he would dismiss the <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> proposal as financially inadequate and vague. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, the court-appointed examiner for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> he was impressed by a new version of the plan under which the unions would risk $ 175 million to $ 200 million of their wages over six months. Eastern sought protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws five days after pilots and flight attendants joined striking Machinists on March 4, reducing the airline's flights by more than 90 percent. The company plans to expand service and recall some 1,700 non-union employees by July 2. `` It's a unique situation. We're going to be the fastest-growing airline in history during the time we're going to be in bankruptcy,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, senior vice president for human resources. Under the austerity program, full-time agents and clerical workers will be scheduled to work 50 hours a week without a pay increase through Dec. 1. Management also will work at least 50 hours a week. No vacations will be allowed through year's end, and no vacation credit will be accrued from March to December this year. Salaries for about 25 corporate officers, including Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, will be reduced 20 percent through the end of the year and 10 percent for the first six months of 1990. The company's proposals for pilots and flight attendants will be discussed when negotiations with the unions representing those groups resume next week, <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said. Union officials said the austerity program proves the company's reorganization plan is failing `` They're not getting the revenue coming in to sustain the people on the payroll,'' said <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Machinists. Eastern is operating with 5,000 workers, most of them management employees. The company had 30,000 workers before the strike and plans to have 17,000 when its reorganization is completed by year's end The number of management jobs will be reduced from 2,900 before the strike to 1,900, and about 1,000 management employees will be reassigned to non-management jobs, <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the Arab world's bitterest rivalries seems headed toward resolution following a bearhug in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. The hugger was <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, who a few days earlier had threatened to boycott the Arab League summit meeting at <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> showed up. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> was the one hugged. That was May 23. Since then, invective has halted from both sides of the Egyptian-Libyan border, now open for the first time in more than a decade. Unannounced, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> canceled military exercises scheduled this week in the desert between <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and is expected to reduce forces concentrated there since the early 1970s. Further, a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> aircraft has landed at <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for the first time in years, with a promise of regular commercial service starting Monday. And Col. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s cousin and intelligence chief, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaddaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON>, spent two days in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, including a meeting Wednesday night with the Egyptian president. If the drama plays out, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'s most strident Arab enemy, soon could restore relations with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s best friends in the region. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told journalists that relations between the two countries `` are on the threshold of a new era based on a right foundation of frankness.'' Several newspapers reported <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> would visit <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, some saying he would drive to <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, 300 miles east of the border. `` It would be just like him,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source on condition of anonymity. `` But we should n't jump to conclusions. We should take it easy and not forget that <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> can just as suddenly change his mind.'' <PERSON> Makram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, a magazine editor and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> confidant, wrote that it is realistic to expect the reopening of borders and airports but `` difficult, for varying reasons, to talk about plans for the far future.'' The first major strains in relations occurred in 1972, when <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> proposed a merger of the two north African neighbors that was rejected by <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>. The break occurred in 1977 with a brief border war after <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> of sponsoring terror bombings in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s government has charged <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> with several attempts to assassinate Libyan dissidents in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, several of whom coordinate anti-Gadhafi campaigns from their Egyptian exile. It also suspected but was unable to prove that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> laid mines in the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in 1984. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> still has no embassy or diplomatic interests section in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, and Libyan dissidents, while not knowing what to expect, still receive police protection. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has asked <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> to send home the exiles, many of them thriving businessmen. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has refused. Libyan exiles had transmitted messages of defiance to their countrymen back home on <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cairo </ORGANIZATION>'s Voice of the Arabs. A source at the official radio service said, however, that the station stopped its anti-Gadhafi rhetoric shortly before the <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION> summit. In <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> also has changed its tone. On Thursday, it distributed a report of a telegram to <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> from a prominent Sudanese politician congratulating `` yourself and the Arab nation for normalizing brotherly relations'' with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. And since the summit meeting, <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> has called the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> instead of its usual term, `` Al-Barek'' _ an insulting term describing a kneeling camel.

 The prosecution's star witness in `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' murder case testified that two bodyguards bragged about killing producer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>. The surprise testimony Friday prompted the judge to halt a preliminary hearing under way to determine if enough evidence exists for trial. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rider </PERSON> said two defendants bragged to him about the <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> murder and one of them said `` he enjoyed shooting the big fat Jew.'' Angry defense lawyers interrupted Rider's testimony, objecting that they had not been told about at least 10 statements he had made in less than an hour on the stand Friday. The lawyers accused prosecutors of hiding incriminating information, which is prohibited under <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> laws. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Conn </PERSON> insisted he had disclosed `` the gist of the statements,'' but Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said that was insufficient. She stopped the hearing and ordered prosecution investigators to appear in court Monday to disclose everything they know about Rider's planned testimony. If more material is uncovered, she said she would grant the defense a continuance. Rider, Hustler magazine Publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>'s brother-in-law and former chief of security, implicated two of <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>'s former bodyguards, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Molony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamota </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, who are charged in the May 1983 <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> murder. Rider's claim that the two confessed to him triggered charges in the six-year-old murder in October. He also implicated reputed drug dealer <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who has refused to testify citing fears he might incriminate himself. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> is not charged. Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>, who is charged in the murder, introduced <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> in a deal to finance the movie, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' Rider's new statements from the witness stand were more detailed than those he had given before. He said <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> boasted to him in May or June 1983 about the <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> murder. `` It was sometime before the body was found and after the killing,'' he said, recalling a conversation with <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> at <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>'s house. `` What did Mr. <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> say?'' asked Conn. `` Only that he had just done a hit and dumped the body up by where we went target practicing,'' said Rider. <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> disappeared on May 13, 1983. His body was found a month later in a dry riverbed about 65 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He had been shot repeatedly in the head. In June, <PERSON> Rider </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> brought him a newspaper article about the discovery of <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s body and said it proved they were telling the truth. He said they referred to <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> by the nickname `` <PERSON> Rodan </PERSON>,'' and offered more details. `` Mr. <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> said that in reference to Mr. <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> getting the courage to shoot Mr. <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>, that he had to drink a bottle of wine before. Mr. <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> shot first and emptied his gun into Mr. <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> followed suit,'' said Rider. `` What else did Mr. <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> say?'' asked Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Conn. </PERSON> `` Just that he hated Jews and he enjoyed shooting the big fat Jew,'' said Rider. Rider, who is being paid $ 3,000 a month as a protected prosecution witness, has said he fears he will be killed because of his testimony. Also charged is <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, who is fighting extradition in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Authorities say the corrupting power of drugs and a belief in witchcraft led to the downfall of a federal agent involved with a cult of ritual killers. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON>, 39, was indicted Friday on drug trafficking charges. The nine-year veteran of the federal judicial police pleaded innocent in 7th Federal Criminal Court. If convicted, he faces a term of of seven to 25 years in prison. In a lengthy statement given earlier to police, <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said his contact with the sect was limited to religious matters. He explained he had been possessed by spirits all his life and sought relief from their disrupting powers from the godfather of the cult, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> described the spirits as useful in helping the victims of black magic but said they were also potent and troublesome. He said he could only get relief from someone with magical powers greater than his own. He said <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> would perform spiritual `` cleansings'' involving animal sacrifice. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> had a lucrative practice as a clairvoyant and `` cleanser'' in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Cleansing'' is designed to remove a hex or evil spell and is widely practiced in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> also said he attended black masses and cult initiations. Deputy Federal Attorney General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a member of the federal drug task force, had been an `` excellent'' officer who was wounded several times in the line of duty. His belief in witchcraft and the corrupting influence of drug money brought about his downfall, <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> said. `` We do n't believe he was responsible for any of the homicides,'' <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> said. One cult member told authorities <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> knew that <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> followers had murdered and dismembered a transvestite in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1988. Another, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> <PERSON> Villareal </PERSON>, the sect's alleged high priestess, said <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> told her he killed two men as a favor to <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. Their bodies were among the 15 discovered in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> in April. <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> has been held in the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> since he was arrested earlier this week. He was not charged in connection with the murders in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> or with other crimes alleged against the sect. Authorities would not say if he will remain on the police force until his case is resolved. The indictment accuses <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of stealing 4.4 pounds of cocaine from a dentist last year in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> along with <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>'s right-hand man, who posed as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agents. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, a 26-year-old Cuban-American, and his lieutenant died May 6 in a shootout with police in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Cult members told police that <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> used his position as a federal agent to protect the smugglers. <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> insisted <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> is the only federal agent linked to the cult. Among the cult's victims was <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, a 21-year-old <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> pre-med student. He was kidnapped, tortured and mutilated in what sect members say was a ceremony to invoke magical protection for the narcotics business.

 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> told Presbyterians at a bicentennial symposium that a major goal is to create one Christian church that cares about the whole world. `` Our highest allegiance is not to one denomination or one nation,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> McClurg </PERSON> said Friday at a symposium on the future preceding Tuesday's start of the 201st <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of the Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> -RRB-. `` When we are doing our work we see ourselves as part of one church.

<HEAD>Ends Don't Meet on State, City Pedway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Question: Why did the bureaucrat cross the road? Answer: Because the underground passage, built by the city and state from opposite directions, did n't meet in the middle. `` Only in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> could we be building our tunnel and they be building their tunnel ... and I guess we missed,'' Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> joked Friday about the pedway linking City Hall and the State of Illinois Building across <LOCATION> Randolph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. But he got serious when he told reporters he was demanding a full report on who was to blame for the mix-up and why the city has agreed to pay for about $ 240,000 worth of corrections. The state's portion was a few inches too far east of the city's -LRB- eight to be exact -RRB- and a few more inches below -LRB- nine -RRB- The problem started when the city hired contractors to dig its half of the pedway and the state contracted with other people to do their half. The result was a four-year delay in opening the tunnel. The opening is now set for September. The mix-up sounds like an episode from a comic opera, but at least one taxpayer is not amused. `` The city screwed up or the state screwed up, but either way, us taxpayers get the bill. So what's new?'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, standing outside <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> and in front of a plywood wall erected to keep pedestrians from the work site. `` I came down here to get my vehicle sticker and I'm glad I did. The way the city is throwing away money,'' added <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, a meatcutter, `` it'll probably cost me more next year.'' The city appropriated $ 240,000 to cover the cost of correcting the mistakes, said mayoral spokeswoman <PERSON> Marj </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>. A published figure of $ 309,000 included money spent on non-corrective work, she said. The changes include a new steel-frame skeleton to accomodate a stairway instead of a ramp, and the addition of an elevator stop at City Hall to give the handicapped the same access to the pedway that was lost when the ramp had to be scrapped. `` To put it simply, we planned a 100-foot-long ramp from City Hall into the pedway,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, the city's coordinating architect. `` But we had to scrap it because hooking the segments as they sit right now would leave a slope too steep for the state code -LRB- regarding handicapped access -RRB-. `` That meant abandoning a lot of what was there and redoing it. We were both supposed to come in at 22 feet, 4 inches below ground level and somebody did n't,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> concluded. That somebody is n't the state, insists <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jazo </PERSON>. `` We do n't want to get into any more finger-pointing,'' she said, `` but our portion is exactly where it should be.''

 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> will test all apples imported into the country following the discovery that some apples from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries contained excessive levels of the chemical Alar, a <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> official said today. <PERSON> Pakdee </PERSON> <PERSON> Pothisiri </PERSON> said the agency has fixed the maximum safety limit of Alar, the trade name for daminozide and used to regulate the ripening of apples, at 20 parts per million. Those found to exceed this level will be taken off the market, he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest apple exporter to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that it was voluntarily halting domestic sales of the chemical because it wanted to calm consumer fears. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has said it plans to ban the use of daminozide in food products because tests in laboratory animals have linked a byproduct of Alar with cancer after the chemical is heated. Final action on the proposed regulation is not expected until next year. Some apples from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> recently tested by health inspectors had a higher content of Alar than this level, <PERSON> Pothisiri </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>With New SkyDome, is Canada's Largest City `Choking on Success?'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Dollar figures U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The new $ 355 million SkyDome stadium is the latest symbol of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s rise to major league stature, but it has also led to questions about traffic congestion, crime and urban woes in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest city. Residents have poured civic pride into preparations for this evening's gala for the world's first stadium with a retractable roof. But many residents wonder how this fast-growing city can handle more downtown crowds. The concerns however go much further than downtown to address the quality of life throughout the booming metropolitan area, which has reached a population of nearly 4 million decades sooner than expected. `` We're really to some extent choking on our growth,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bossons </PERSON>, an economics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> who long has been involved in municipal issues. `` We've been too successful in a sense.'' He recalled a transportation study of five or six years ago that projected a metropolitan population of 4 million by the year 2011. Five million people in metropolitan <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, which had half that many residents in 1971, now seems more appropriate for 2011. The 60,000-seat <LOCATION> Skydome </LOCATION>, at the foot of the landmark CN Tower, will be the home of the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jays </ORGANIZATION> of baseball's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argonauts </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Skydome </LOCATION> roof was designed to open or close in 20 minutes, but inspectors found exposed wiring, missing sprinklers and faulty fire prevention devices among 150 deficiencies. An operating permit finally was granted Thursday, but critics say deficiencies remain in the stadium, which they call another example of development run amuck. Critics also predict that fans will swamp already crowded streets and highways with the extra traffic to the complex. <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> has prided itself on keeping residential neighborhoods near downtown. Its public transit system still is considered a model. Movie set designers have to scatter garbage on the streets when trying to make <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> look like an American city. Not short on civic cheer, the city is seeking the 1996 Summer Olympics and a world's fair for the year 2000. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, director of the urban studies program at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION>, said residents are troubled at their recollections of a calmer, different <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> 10 or 15 years ago. `` It is n't that it's bad; it's just becoming a city,'' she said. Supporters of a movement that promises to firmly regulate development won a majority of city council seats in a municipal election late last year. `` It was very, very clear in the election that people were really concerned about what they perceive as a decline in the quality of life,'' <PERSON> Bosson </PERSON> said. `` We're a city at the crossroads,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Layton </PERSON>, one of the most visible council members, said in an interview. `` I think the city has been a little too smug in thinking of itself as such a success.'' He said the housing problems in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> should be getting more attention than stadium-building. A newspaper poll of 1,800 people taken for a 10-part series in the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> last month found that 35.6 percent of city residents were more afraid of walking alone at night than five years ago and 48 percent more afraid of riding the subway alone at night. `` We still brag that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest city does n't have half the problems that are sucking the life out of urban <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the series wrote. `` But suddenly we are n't so sure that it ca n't happen to us.'' Housing costs have soared in the economic boom that has lasted through most of the decade, pushing the average cost of a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> home to more than $ 232,000 and making `` affordable housing'' a prime city issue. The only other Canadian city that even comes close is <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, where the average price has risen to $ 176,700. The average housing price in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> is $ 92,600 and in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, $ 71,600.

<HEAD>Oil Ministers Meet to Discuss Prices, Production</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers say discussions have barely begun on whether to produce more oil at a time when prices of a barrel have surged 40 percent since November. Nigerian Oil Minister <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, said officials discussed `` the whole agenda'' during private talks Friday. He would not elaborate. The ministers of the 13-nation group were meeting privately today to try to work out a production agreement for the last half of the year. Their formal strategy session begins Monday. Most ministers appear unwilling to adopt tactics that could upset what has been a surprisingly strong market so far this year. Indeed, some officials say the ministers may decide to roll over the current agreement for another six months. In November, the ministers agreed to curb their production and set a cap of 18.5 million barrels a day. They settled on a benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel. Since then, the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has shot up, rising more than 40 percent to nearly $ 17.70 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, has been trading around $ 20 a barrel. Prices have been pushed up not only by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s output cuts but also by accidents in oil-producing areas. They have combined to trim the supply of oil on the world market. In their bargaining, the ministers will discuss whether to maintain their output cap, or lift it to 19.5 million or 20 million barrels a day, as several countries have requested. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report: Bush To Propose Alternative Fuels Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to press 25 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities to begin converting to alternative fuels as early as 1992 to battle urban smog, a newspaper reported today. The most stringent of the four options <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is considering would require that 50 percent of all new cars, trucks and buses in the 25 cities be required to run on alternative fuels by 1995, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. The least stringent option would require only buses and official automobiles in those cities to use alternative fuels, but would accelerate the deadline to 1992, the Times said. The cities were not identified in the 42-page White House document prepared by the President's <ORGANIZATION> Domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and obtained by the Times. But the cities would include <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and other major urban areas, the Times said. The president's alternative fuels plan represents the central element of his effort to revive and overhaul the federal effort _ stalled under the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> _ to combat pollution in major cities. Alternative fuels, including compressed natural gas, methanol and ethanol, burn more cleanly than gasoline and reduce the production of ozone, the major component of smog. Even the stringent pollution-reduction plan outlined for the president would leave 23 cities in violation of federal air standards by the year 2005. Last summer, 81 cities fell short of the federal standards. The cost of the various proposals was not outlined in the document presented to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but estimates range from $ 2.1 billion to $ 4.6 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. The report says that the use of alternative fuels would `` obviate the need for other more costly automobile controls'' on emissions. Controls such as changes in tail pipes and fuel pumps have been strongly opposed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto makers. The report also suggests that cities be given the opportunity to `` opt out'' of the alternative fuels requirement if they can find other was to reduce smog substantially. The report was presented to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before he left last weekend for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It faces final review Monday during a meeting of the Domestic Policy Council.

 Activists demonstrating this weekend at the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant say the imminent start of atomic testing at the reactor should help their cause. `` Now it's beginning to sound real. Before it was sounding kind of nebulous,'' <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocheron </PERSON> of the anti-nuclear <ORGANIZATION> Clamshell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> said Friday night as the first demonstrators began trickling into this seacoast town. `` People are fired up against the nuke, especially now that they got the low-power testing license,'' <PERSON> Crocheron </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> a low-power testing licence last week. The first atomic chain reaction is expected at the reactor by the middle of next week. The alliance was planning a major rally today at <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, on the crowded beach peninsula less than two miles from <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> that is a focal point of the struggle over whether the $ 6 billion reactor ever will operate commercially. Evacuation plans for the beaches and communities up to 10 miles away from the plant must be approved before the plant may operate commercially. On Sunday, the activists plan a mass civil disobedience action at the plant site. <PERSON> Clamshell </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> said at least 300 to 500 people already had undergone non-violent civil disobedience training, and more training sessions were being held throughout the weekend. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> town officials' request for an injunction against Sunday's demonstration <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> police Chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> indicated Friday police may arrest demonstrators before they reach the plant gates on Sunday. Some of the protesters hope to scale fences around the outer plant boundary and symbolically `` occupy'' the site. Protest organizers hope this weekend's demonstrations will be the largest in more than a decade at <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>. There have been about 2,500 arrests in protests that began when construction started in 1976, including 1,414 arrests in a May 1977 protest that helped make <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> a symbol of the nation's anti-nuclear movement.

 Clinicians are preserving transplant organs for longer periods in an improved chemical solution that is healthier for patients and gives doctors more leeway in scheduling surgery. `` This solution is clearly better than what's been available. It's a major advance in transplantation,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, associate professor of surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. The biggest impact has been in liver transplants, where half of all organs go to waste because of logistical and organizational problems, said the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>'s Dr. <PERSON> Folkert </PERSON> <PERSON> Belzer </PERSON>, who developed the solution. His mixture, previously available to select transplant centers on an experimental basis, was approved for general use last month by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The solution includes hormones, amino acids and sugars. It prevents tissue swelling and cell deterioration from the time the organ is removed from a brain-dead victim until it is transplanted. Under the older preservation method, livers were chilled and flushed with Euro-Collins solution, a mix of electrolytes and glucose. With the older solution, surgical teams had to spring into action as soon as donor organs were found and transplant candidates had to live near the center. Transplants often began in the middle of the night, with one operation sometimes starting as soon as another finished. Organs regularly were turned down because of a lack of doctors or surgical space. `` This is the first time we've ever been able to do a liver and pancreas electively,'' <PERSON> Belzer </PERSON> said Friday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> solution, called ViaSpan and marketed by <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, has allowed for greater sharing of organs. Last fall, for example, a liver was shipped from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and successfully transplanted. Another was shipped from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. It's also enabled doctors to trim livers for young recipients or split them for two patients when necessary. Studies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have found livers can be preserved safely outside the body for as long as 36 hours with the solution, compared to a maximum six to eight hours with other methods, said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Southard </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>. Pancreases have been stored for as long as 29 hours with the solution, <PERSON> Southard </PERSON> said. The preservation time for kidneys remains about the same, 30 to 40 hours, regardless of which solution is used, <PERSON> Southard </PERSON> said. But studies show recipients of kidneys preserved in the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> mixture do not return as often to dialysis because of organ rejection and other problems.

<HEAD>Conservative Episcopalians Form Church Within Denomination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Conservative Episcopalians reacting to the election of the first woman bishop have created a new association to `` transform'' their denomination. Nearly 2,000 people attended the founding meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synod </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Friday. The delegates adopted a constitution Friday and planned to end their meeting today. The dissident church members said they were displeased with loosening strictures on marriage, tolerance of homosexuality, feminist theology, revisions of liturgical language to be gender-inclusive and what they saw as slackening standards of personal morality in the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we remain a church within the church, our goal is n't to be a small cell, but to be a witness to hopefully transform our religion,'' said Bishop <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schofield </PERSON> of the Episcopal Diocese of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. But members of the new church say they do not intend to break with the nearly 2.5 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which has lost about a quarter of its members since doctrinal controversies reached their peak in the mid-1970s. The church is one of 27 branches of the 70 million-member Anglican Communion worldwide. Bishop <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> was elected president of the new association. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s laws do not prevent the traditionalists from forming a voluntary association, and he called for the acceptance of the new organization as a way for traditionalists to stay within the church. Twenty-one other <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> bishops, 16 of them retired, have endorsed the synod. Leaders of the Fort Worth-based Evangelical and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, a traditionalist group, called the synod after the Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was consecrated as the first female Episcopal bishop last year in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` This year we will have women bishops, next year they'll delete a book or two from the New Testament,'' said <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a lay member of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` The substance of the question remains the same: On what ground do you stand?'' The new synod passed a resolution recommending usage of the 1928 Book of Common Prayer, which is discouraged by the church, alongside the 1979 revision.

 Thousands of boat people, saying they would rather die than return to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, today maintained a hunger strike to protest immigration policies in this British colony, officials said. About 2,000 Vietnamese began the protest Thursday, and another 3,300 joined them Friday, said a government official.

The policy has not curbed the flows of Vietnamese. Since the plan was implemented, more than 20,000 boat people have arrived in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and only 1,600 have been screened. A total of 9,203 boat people arrived in May, compared with 2,918 in April and 842 in March.

<TEXT>
 A church-going accountant accused of murdering five relatives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> 18 years ago broke down in tears several times during a visit from his minister. `` There seemed to be some relief about him,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vought </PERSON>, who visited <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> List </PERSON>, 63, in jail Friday. `` Whether that was reflective of the fact that he did n't have to put up the front anymore, I do n't know.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested List _ known to his wife, employer and neighbors in the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Midlothian </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> _ Thursday on charges of fleeing to avoid prosecution for the Nov. 9, 1971, slayings of five family members in <LOCATION> Westfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` His wife had no idea who he was,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office. `` Her reaction was disbelief and shock.'' A tip resulting from a May 21 broadcast of the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> television show `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' which dramatized the crimes, led to List's arrest. List did not change his appearance or his profession after the killings, but moved to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, where he met his current wife at a Lutheran church function in 1977 and married her eight years later, authorities said. `` I was shocked to hear about <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s arrest and what he was charged with,'' said <PERSON> Delores </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who married the man she knew as <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> in 1985. `` This is not the man I know,'' she told The Richmond News Leader. `` The man I know is kind, loving, a devoted husband and a dear friend.'' An attorney for List, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>, said Friday that his client had declined a bond hearing and will remain in the <LOCATION> Henrico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail. A removal and probable cause hearing was set for Thursday in federal court. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> August </PERSON>, who was among the three <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who arrested List, said List initially denied he was the man sought by authorities. Agents took List to the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, where a fingerprint expert determined that the man was List. On Dec. 7, 1971, the bodies of List's mother, <PERSON> Alma </PERSON>, 85; his wife, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, 45; and their three children, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, 16, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> 15, and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, 13, were found in their 18-room <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> mansion, after neighbors noticed lightbulbs going out in the home, police said. After the slayings, investigators found that List had two mortgages on his house, was failing as a financial consultant and had been siphoning money from his mother's $ 200,000 savings account.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> and his Cabinet today convened for the first time, but doubts remain whether the public will be satisfied by what opposition politicians called a stopgap government. Parliament elected Uno as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 47th prime minister Friday to replace <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who resigned because of an influence-peddling scandal. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s appointment ended the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s five-week search for a candidate untainted by the scandal. The new government was formally approved by Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> in an afternoon ceremony at the Imperial Palace in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The first meeting of Uno's 21-member Cabinet followed at the prime minister's official residence. Opposition political parties and many analysts said they expect Uno to last only a few months, perhaps departing this summer if the Liberal Democrats fare poorly in an election expected in July for half the seats in the upper house. During an 80-minute news conference after his first Cabinet meeting, however, the 66-year-old former foreign minister said he expected to be a success. `` It is not an interim Cabinet, and I can tell you that it will be a Cabinet which will be highly appraised,'' he said. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said he had changed some of the party practices and declared that `` all the Cabinet members agreed to put priority on carrying out various reforms.'' Asked if he would be influenced in any way by former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, the longtime leader of the party faction in which <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was a senior member, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> reminded reporters he quit the faction upon assuming the premiership and that <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> resigned from the party because of the scandal. `` I highly admire the former prime minister for his achievements ... but I'll do it my own way,'' <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said. Uno has pledged `` a clean start'' for Japanese politics, which have been stained by the scandal in which <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information services conglomerate, tried to buy favors from senior politicians and bureaucrats. The most pressing task for Uno will be to reverse low public approval ratings for his party before next month's elections for the upper house of parliament. The Liberal Democrats have controlled both houses of parliament since 1955, but political observers say the party could lose its hold on government as a result of the Recruit scandal. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s choice as party secretary general, <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>, told reporters on Friday he had received $ 17,000 in 1985-86 from the Recruit Co. The new chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Masajuro </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiokawa </PERSON>, said he gave an unsigned receipt to another <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, who used it to divide a large donation from Recruit among several receipts to skirt legal reporting requirements. The makeup of the new Uno administration, which contains six of the same Cabinet ministers who served under <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, `` raises the strong suspicion that the Liberal Democrats have learned nothing serious from the Recruit scandal,'' the daily <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> wrote in an editorial today. Of the 17 politicians or aides involved in purchases of cut-rate stock offered by Recruit, 13 were Liberal Democrats.

<TEXT>
 Syrian gunners blasted the Christian heartland with 400 howitzer shells today, and five artillery rounds crashed into Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in another violation of a cease-fire called three weeks ago. Police said they could not determine the source of fire on west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, but the Moslem-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> radio station blamed Christian army units of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. It was the first time that west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has been shelled since an Arab League cease-fire was called May 11. Although Syrian gunners had been harassing the Christian heartland with daily shelling, today's barrage was the most severe in three weeks. It engulfed the coastal stertch north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> and the nearby <PERSON> Hadath </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kfar </PERSON> <PERSON> Shima </PERSON> districts. No casualties were reported, mainly because most of the shells crashed into the Christian and Moslem neighborhoods at dawn while people were indoors. An aide to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said, `` We wo n't remain idle if the cease-fire violations persist. The general is not prepared to accept the intensifying shelling.'' `` We will be forced to fire back,'' he said on condition of anonymity. He denied the army had fired on west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today. He accused Syrian gunners of hitting the Christians and the Moslems `` so that our citizens in the western sector would have the impression that we are shelling them.'' The aide said Christian gunners would not take any action until after a meeting Sunday in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, of a committee the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> appointed to seek a solution to the crisis in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Peace will prevail if the leaders adopt a clear decision on consolidating the cease-fire and lifting the blockades,'' the aide said. `` If they fail to stop the Syrian violation of the ceae-fire, then we will have to fire back.'' The latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war began March 8 when <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The Syrians and Moslems retaliated by shelling the Christian heartland, then blockading the 310-square-mile enclave.

Two people were reported missing and at least four were hurt. <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials said four children were among the dead in <LOCATION> Malita </LOCATION>, including a 9-day-old baby who drowned when a house was swept by floodwaters. Another infant was accidentally crushed to death by his mother as she tried to clasp her arms around a tree as the tornado passed. Miss <PERSON> Laguidao </PERSON> said the storm forced 650 families, about 3,900 people, to evacuate their homes. <PERSON> Malita </PERSON> remains under `` waist-high'' water, she said. The flooding prevented government relief trucks from reaching the area after two bridges collapsed. `` That tornado was a freak,'' said forecaster Jun Falcon. `` We seldom get tornadoes here unless there is a sudden drop in atmospheric pressure.'' The storm forced rescuers today to halt a search for 21 people believed trapped in several mine shafts after a landslide and fire in a gold-mining community on the slopes of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diwalwal </LOCATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> province.

Restoring the large red-and-white sign, which says `` Drink Coca-Cola,'' was the idea of the pharmacy's owner, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, who said townspeople had told him he had a historic treasure under layers of paint on the store's wall. `` I'd heard the rumor for years,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said, `` and then I finally got confirmation from Coca-Cola that this was the first painted wall sign.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said the original sign was painted in 1894 by salesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Couden </PERSON>, who set the precedent for what later became a standard offer: Sell Coca-Cola in your shop and the company would paint your wall for free. `` <PERSON> Couden </PERSON> was a salesman first and painter next,'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said Friday night, `` so his sign is not quite up to specs. The letters are kind of squashed.'' <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Free </PERSON> described them as `` chunky'' and said she found another feature that attests to <PERSON> Couden </PERSON>'s amateur status as a painter. `` He left the ` I' out of drink,'' she said. `` It looks like he left it out and then stuck it back in there. It's crammed up with the ` N'.'' She and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, who operate a restoration company called Signs of the Times, had a difficult time getting to the point where they could critique the sign. They said what they had thought would be a five-day job ended up taking almost 30. The task was made difficult because they could not be sure that the Coca-Cola sign was the first paint put on the brick wall. `` If we had taken all the paint off -LRB- except the bottom layer -RRB- in the beginning, we could have lost the sign,'' Miss <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. So they used heat guns and spatulas to chip away at a section of the wall that held a modern Coca-Cola sign. After going through layer after layer of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> advertising, they found the original sign. After the oldest <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> sign was exposed, the painters worked at matching the original colors. They plan to repaint it next week. The extra work boosted the cost of the restoration project. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said the final bill will be $ 8,000 to $ 10,000. He is paying most of the tab, but <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> will pay part. `` I hope the state will put up a historical marker,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. `` But if not, I will or maybe Coca-Cola will.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he brought a `` message of hope'' back from his triumphant weeklong trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but says he does n't expect Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to respond soon to arms control initiatives embraced by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations. `` There's no grand design out there right now now. We just want to move forward,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. The president went for an early-morning jog near his oceanside estate and told reporters he had trouble sleeping, first waking up at 3 a.m. and then rising at 4:45 a.m. The president planned to go fishing today in his boat and was to meet in the afternoon with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>. Asked if he'd heard yet from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the president shouted as he jogged past a group of reporters: `` No phone calls yet.'' He is scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday. At an arrival ceremony at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Pease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, on Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared: `` We must stay on the offensive. We must now get to work to end the cold war.'' `` I am now returning from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with a message for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people _ a message of hope,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a jubilant gathering attended by a welcoming crowd of several thousand invited guests, many of them schoolchildren. `` We have a great and historic opportunity to shape the changes that are transforming <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, basking in praise from allies of his proposal for dramatic troop reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and for resolving a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> dispute over short-range missiles, told reporters on Air Force One shortly before his arrival that he had not heard directly from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the proposals. He added: `` You do n't expect an instant answer. But I'm confident we will and I hope it's positive. `` It will be a while'' until a formal Soviet response, he suggested. On prospects of a summit meeting this year with the Soviet leader, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I've always felt that we eventually will get together and should.'' But the president gave no clues on when such a meeting might take place, and dismissed suggestions that he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might cross paths when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> next month for the seven-nation economic summit of industrial democracies in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> _ a trip that will also take him to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` I think the first priority is to follow through on the collective decision that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has taken ... So we've got some work to do to make this <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> decision into a reality. But I'm determined to kick our bureaucracy and the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy as best I can -LRB- to -RRB- push it forward,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. After arriving in this seacoast resort, the president immediately headed out into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> on his 28-foot speedboat, `` Fidelity,'' on a fishing trip _ spending about two hours out before rain and a smoking engine forced him to return to port. He pointed gleefully to a mackerel that his fishing party had caught as he returned to the marina where he keeps his boat. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had no public appearances planned before he returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday afternoon. In his arrival remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his proposal for conventional arms cuts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which would include the withdrawal of 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, was `` bold but fundamentally fair.'' At the summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a drastic reduction in East-West conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and said the cuts should come by 1993. At <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s urging, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations also agreed to a compromise settlement of a dispute over short-range nuclear missiles that will enable the weapons to be put on the negotiating table after a conventional arms deal is completed. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had voiced skepticism of such negotiations while <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wanted them immediately. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the compromise demonstrated that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> could `` manage change while remaining true to the strategy of deterrence which has kept the peace'' for the past 40 years. In his talk with reporters on Air Force One, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if he felt his assertiveness in seeking to seize the initiative from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> by proposing new disarmament initiatives in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> had won him new respect at home. Mentioning comedian <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON>, whose complaints about not getting respect became a classic comedy line, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` You mean, like <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON> kind of thing? I've not suffered from lack of respect.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> allowed that he felt `` pretty good'' about the events of the past few days.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities have stepped up security at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after receiving indications that <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> terrorists may be planning an attack, a spokesman said today. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jalezke </PERSON>, spokesman for the Hesse state <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said the alert was linked to the sentencing of hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, was convicted of murder and air piracy and sentenced to life imprisonment on May 17 for hijacking a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner in June 1985. During the hijacking, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was shot and killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. Less than a week after <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s sentencing, authorities ordered all airports in the country to tighten security. <PERSON> Jalezke </PERSON> said the latest alert came after authorities received indications that a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> terrorist group he did not identify may be planning a retaliatory attack for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s sentencing. He said the information received by authorities focused on a terrorist action against air traffic. The information lacked specifics but had to be taken seriously, <PERSON> Jalezke </PERSON> said. The spokesman declined to give details about the security measures taken at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, except to say that the number of policemen guarding continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s busiest airport has been increased. Some British news reports have questioned security at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where they say the bomb that destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 was planted. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and switched to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Investigators say a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette recorder stored in luggage in the hold destroyed the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-bound </LOCATION> plane as it flew over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on Dec. 21. The crash killed all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground. West German authorities have repeatedly insisted there is no evidence the bomb was planted in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> said today that if <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> wants to regain international recognition it must admit that the communists rule mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s statement was the first public acknowledgment by a Taiwanese leader that the communists control the mainland. He made it at the opening session of a three-day congress of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> since the Nationalists lost the mainland to the communists in a 1949 civil war. `` We should have the courage to face the situation that for the time being we are unable to exert effective rule over the mainland,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> told delegates, who included aged Nationalist officials who fought in the war. However, he refused to relinquish the Nationalist claim to the mainland. `` There is only one <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the country will be reunified eventually. The ultimate goal of our foreign policy is to keep the nation's sovereignty intact,'' he said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> also reiterated what is popularly known as <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s `` Three No'' policy toward the communists _ no official contacts, no compromise and no talks. His address was considered a veiled criticism of the party's conservative Old Guard, whose refusal to acknowledge communist rule of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been blamed for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s diplomatic isolation Only 23 countries recognize the Nationalists, compared to 136 that have diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said he believes a more flexible and pragmatic foreign policy will encourage many countries to `` readjust their short-sighted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> policy'' and recognize his Nationalist government. The Nationalists, he said, continue to support a student-led democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because the protesters `` are linked to us by blood, in their fight for freedom, democracy and survival.'' Also today, the party's newly appointed Secretary-General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Soong </PERSON> told delegates <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> never will use force to reunify <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` The reunified <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> we are seeking shall be guided by the free will of all the Chinese and the principles of democracy,'' said <PERSON> Soong </PERSON>.

 An Egyptian naval ship opened fire on an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> fishing boat today as it drew close to Egyptian territory, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The captain of the fishing vessel was reported wounded. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Allon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> demanded Egyptian authorities explain their actions. `` We do n't know exactly what happened in this case, and we are asking the Egyptians for details,'' he said. The radio said the confrontation occurred this morning near <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a popular spot for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> divers, off the coast of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION> and near the Egyptian beach resort of <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>. The radio said the Israeli fishing vessel was one mile from shore when an Egyptian naval craft approached and opened fire. The captain of the Israeli vessel was hit in the legs and stomach, but he managed to pilot his craft back to an Israeli-held area of the beach. He was rushed to a hospital in the southern resort city of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION>, the radio said. <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s territorial limits vary in different areas near <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION> but added that Israeli boats may not anchor or loiter in Egyptian waters. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> returned <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, a 250-acre resort to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in March, after seven years of bitter squabbling over the beach resort.

 Hundreds of people ate hot dogs and listened to music today at a party thrown for the city where <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 tumbled to earth, but relatives of crash victims said the good time was in bad taste. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaus </PERSON>, a 14-year-old from <LOCATION> Sicklerville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who suggested the idea for the party to lift the city's spirits, said he was surprised to learn the party had been dubbed `` Ed's Party.'' `` I just want all the kids to come here and enjoy themselves because they missed Christmas and everyone should have a Christmas,'' he said. A bomb on board Flight 103 exploded over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> four days before Christmas, killing all 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground. Burning wreckage from the New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 destroyed several <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> homes. Relatives of some victims said the party was in poor taste. `` I have been talking with a number of those people bereaved by this outrage and, without exception, they are saying that holding this party is repugnant and abhorrent,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Swire </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> Families-Flight 103 group, said today. Swire's daughter died in the explosion. <PERSON> Blaus </PERSON>, who read about the bombing in the newspapers and in letters from <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> pen pal <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, said he first wanted to send presents to <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, but his idea just grew. `` I wrote to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> because I thought that everyone should have a Christmas, no matter what. I just wanted them to send presents over and they said they would help me,'' he said. `` But it just got bigger and bigger.

Pan Am flew <PERSON> Blaus </PERSON>, his parents and three brothers to <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has said it was not organizing the party. Community leader <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> said the party was supported by most local people, `` not to cause distress or anguish, but to prove to themselves and the world that whereas we mourn those who died, they are determined to repair their town, rebuild shattered lives and ensure a special and sacred place in their hearts for the 270 people from 24 nations who died.'' Complaints from relatives of the victims led the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to cancel plans to send <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> to the party, and the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> company decided against supplying hot dogs.

 Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> said today he will fight to oust President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo unless his government takes steps to bring full democracy to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, head of the largest opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, also said his talks with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, scheduled for later this month, could be their last meeting. `` Let's give the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government six more months to solve the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> issue and implement full democracy. If it still fails to fulfill the mission, our party will be all out to terminate it,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told a rally of 100,000 people at a <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> college. Dissidents are demanding that the government divulge details of police suppression of a 1980 uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> in which, by government count, at least 200 people were killed. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> demanded that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, and other government officials be held responsible for `` the unpardonable massacre'' in the city. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s remarks were his strongest challenge to the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government since <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s party emerged as the No. 1 opposition party in the 1988 general elections <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government is backing away from promised democratic reforms. His speech was interrupted twice as dozens of radical students protested his party's moderate policies. Supporters threw cans and bottles and drove out protesting students. After the two-hour rally, 10,000 people began a march through downtown streets, shouting slogans for the ouster of the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> govenrment. Groups of up to 1,000, hurling rocks, fought police in the city center for several hours. Some people were injured, but police had no overall figures. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> has long been a popular in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, the capital city of his home province, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cholla </LOCATION>, but his visit today was marred by protests over his party's comparatively moderate policies. `` No compromise with murderers,'' protesters, mostly students, shouted as <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> arrived at a cemetery where the bodies of the 1980 <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> victims are buried. Some protesters threw eggs, water and sand at <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and party officials as they arrived at a hospital morgue to pay homage to the body of a dissident student found dead at a reservoir last month. The opposition leader was not hit. Authorities announced early this week that the student, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol-kyu </PERSON>, 24, died by drowning, but dissidents claim that he was tortured to death by police. In central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, 1,000 radical students and dissidents held a rally today at <ORGANIZATION> Myungdong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, demanding that authorities reinvestigate the student's death. They shouted slogans such as `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> regime.

 A previously unknown Moslem group today claimed it planted a small bomb that exploded in front of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The homemade bomb, which caused no injuries, apparently was intended for the neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Police said it was hurled from a moving vehicle Friday after riot police fired tear gas and bullets to disperse 500 Moslem demonstrators trying to march to the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Moslems accuse Indian peacekeeping troops of failing to prevent clashes between Tamils and Moslems in which at least 13 people were killed last month. Most Tamils are Hindu, and both groups are ethnic minorities among the majority Sinhalese Buddhists. Newspaper offices today received statements from the <ORGANIZATION> Noorul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claiming responsibility for the bomb. Police said they have not heard of the group. Indian troops were sent to northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in 1987 to enforce a peace accord to end a Tamil separatist revolt. Moslems accuse the Tamils of trying to force them, as well as the Sinhalese, out of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>.

 The once-bustling Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> is a ghost town. Daily shelling by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> forces has driven most residents underground and sapped the life from the region once known as the <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The barrages have eased since the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> called for a cease-fire May 11, but a gas shortage has paralyzed the region, adding to the problems of a Christian population outnumbered and outgunned by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its allies. `` If it's not shelling, it's gas, and if it's not gas it's something else,'' said <PERSON> Samira </PERSON> <PERSON> Khater </PERSON>, a secretary An air of stupor hangs over the 310-square-mile enclave, home to about 1 million Christians. There is hardly any traffic. Business is slow. Factories that survived 11 weeks of ferocious shelling limp along with skeleton staffs and whatever fuel they can scrounge. Restaurants are lucky if they get 10 customers a day. Half the shops, hidden behind sandbags and earth-filled oildrums, are shuttered. The night life that once throbbed in the clubs, bars and restaurants along the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coastline is dead. The famous Casino du Liban, where oil-rich sheiks and high rollers from around the world gambled, is closed. It was a regular target for Syrian gunners who have battled the forces of Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> since March 8 in some of the most savage battles of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. Some 360 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded, mostly civilians. The Christians are tired and dispirited, struggling to cope with a grim fatalism. The Syrians maintain their blockade of the Christian enclave, ringed on its landward sides by hostile Moslem forces. Small cargo ships run the gauntlet of shellfire to bring in food and ammunition for the Christians, so there is no shortage of those items. But the blockade runners do n't try bringing in gas. `` It only takes one hit to blow up a ship loaded with fuel,'' a police spokesman said. Supermarkets bulge with imported goods _ pink chamapagne, passion fruit tea, 10 brands of whisky, cookies, chocolates, hams, cheeses. Fruit and vegetables are in short supply, but available for a price. Before the fighting, most produce came from Syrian-controlled areas. Now they are smuggled in at night by mule train from the north. The enclave's fuel reserves went up in flames when a Syrian barrage blew up the seaside <LOCATION> Dora </LOCATION> depot in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> two months ago. The French, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s colonial rulers until 1943 and the Christians' traditional protector, shipped in 4,000 tons of fuel to reactivate closed power plants a few weeks ago. But there's precious little gasoline around. Only about one-fifth of filling stations bother to open. Police said two people have been killed and 10 wounded in gunfights over gas. A worker at one filling station, who did not want to be identified, said it opens `` only when the army can send a tank to maintain order.'' `` That's why people have to wait for days in front of the stations, and all they get in the end is 10 liters,'' a little more than two gallons, he said. Gas costs about $ 3.50 for 5 -LCB- gallons, but on the black market the same amount is going for $ 50 _ a month's wages for many Lebanese. `` Filling station owners pump out the gas from their tanks and sell it on the black market for 10 times the price,'' said one motorist. Long lines of cars, some extending for a mile, sit outside many stations. `` At first, everyone used to wait for days in their cars, even during the shelling,'' grocer <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON> said. `` Now we take turns to wait for a station to open. `` When it does, whoever's keeping vigil telephones everyone else and they all rush to the station.'' The casualties and damage wrought by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s `` war of liberation'' to drive the Syrians out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has turned many Christians against the man many hail as their hero. `` <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has used the Christian people,'' said one young man who declined to be identified. `` He's led them into a dark tunnel of hunger, death and siege because of his personal ambition to become president.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s breakneck timetable for wrapping up a conventional arms agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may be too optimistic given the complexity of the negotiations, analysts say. But they say the president's sweeping proposals for slashing troops and weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will broaden East-West bargaining at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> arms talks and ensure that an eventual accord will be wide-ranging. `` It will be a more comprehensive set of negotiations and a more comprehensive agreement,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fieldhouse </PERSON>, a research fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` That also means,'' he said, `` it will be more difficult.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants the talks brought to `` an early and satisfactory conclusion'' within six to 12 months and their results implemented no later than 1993. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, deputy director of the London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initiative `` produces better prospects than hitherto for striking an arms control bargain.'' But he cautioned it will be `` impossibly hard without an enormous amount of good will'' between the East and West negotiators to bring the talks to an end a year from now. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s unveiling of the plan at a summit of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was an attempt by the West to seize the arms control initiative from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It also let the leaders of the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations emerge from their 40th anniversary celebration united. `` They got their act together and confirmed they have very much more in common on what really matters,'' said Cross. The president's bargaining offer calls for sharp cuts in Soviet and American troops stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and in tanks, artillery and other conventional, or non-nuclear, arms. Moreover, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in a turnabout, would be willing to negotiate reductions in combat aircraft and helicopters. The inclusion of aircraft, analysts say, will expand the discussions to an important area of concern. But it also will make the talks tougher because of the difficulty in defining attack planes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also urged that the two sides agree to destroy all weapons that are singled out for reductions and that the troops be disbanded. His proposal was unanimously adopted by the other 15 delegates at the meeting at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. They agreed to let experts take a look at the plan and draw up a detailed offer to put on the bargaining table when talks resume in September. The Conventional Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> negotiations began last March between the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations and the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. They cover the region spanning the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Analysts had predicted the discussions would last several years at least. Previous negotiations dragged on 15 years with no agreement. <PERSON> Fieldhouse </PERSON> said, `` It's clear enough that the two alliances have similar enough objectives and enough common ground to reach an accord.'' Such an agreement, said <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, would reduce substantially the military threat in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but not erase the military might. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said, will remain a powerful force and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will have enough strength to mount a defense if needed. Under the American plan, troop densities would be thinned. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed that both sides reduce their troop strength in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to 275,000 on each side. That would mean a cut, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates, of 350,000 for the Soviets and 30,000 for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s opening position would require the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> to big massive cuts in main battle tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers, considered key forces in an invasion or surprise attack. The West would make smaller trims of 5 percent to 10 percent in those categories. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies want the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nations to clip their forces to a level equal with the West _ and below <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s current holdings. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arms control offer helped solve a bitter alliance dispute over the future role of short-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had demanded that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> enter early talks with the Soviets on reducing tactical nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> argued attention should first be placed on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s enormous superiority in non-nuclear weapons. The leaders' final statement said they would be prepared to discuss a partial reduction in battlefield nuclear missiles but only after implementation of a conventional arms accord was under way. By underscoring the word `` partial,'' the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> were able to halt, at least temporarily, a German push for elimination of all those weapons. Bowing to German pleas, the allies also agreed to put off key decisions on introducing and deploying a more powerful generation of short-range nuclear missiles until 1992.

<TEXT>
 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is the most popular foreign leader <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has known and rates much higher than Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, according to poll results released Saturday. The Der Spiegel newsmagazine, which conducted the poll, said the only West German politician more popular than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>. It augurs well for the Soviet leader's June 12-15 visit to this country but could be ominous for <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who faces federal elections in 1990. The magazine asked 2,000 West German voters to rate <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and West German politicians on a popularity scale from minus five to plus five. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> received 2.2, while <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was rated at minus 0.6. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who paid a 25-hour visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last week, received 0.7, while French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> also lagged behind <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with 1.7. `` Even <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> at their peaks were not as popular as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said. Only <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> fared better than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the magazine said, but it did say what rating he received. The presidency is a mostly ceremonial post in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, who has been leading West German calls for closer ties to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and more disarmament talks, received a 1.4 rating. <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said even West Germans who usually vote for <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> rated <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> nearly as high as the chancellor, giving <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> 2.0 and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> 1.9 Among those voters, 95 percent find <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> farsighted, 94 percent think he is full of ideas and 95 percent say he is hard-working, the magazine said. A parallel survey was conducted for the magazine by the <ORGANIZATION> Sociology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, which polled 1,000 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> citizens. Only 59 percent of those polled in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said they are convinced <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies will succeed, the magazine said. In the West German poll, 82 percent said they believe <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will succeed. According to <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, 76 percent of Muscovites queried replied that `` perestroika will not be supported by the population any more if the supply situation does not improve.'' It said 61 percent of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> residents polled think the Soviet economy is in `` bad or very bad'' shape. <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> released a summary of the survey results in advance of the magazine's publication Monday.

 South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> says his government is eliminating racial discrimination and is ready to share power with the black majority, <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Saturday. `` Apartheid has to be removed. The supremacy of whites must be ended,'' the conservative newspaper quoted <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as saying in an interview. But <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said this must done slowly to avoid chaos, it said. `` We are in agreement among us on this. We find ourselves in a reform process and we accept that the supremacy of the whites has to come to an end. Our government is in the process of removing apartheid,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> reportedly said. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said his government must examine closely laws governing racially separate residential areas and the registration of people by race. `` The racial discrimination that the blacks see in these laws has to be removed. `` I am not saying that this can be achieved simply from one day to another. If we lift these laws, a state of chaos would result. As far as the lifting of discriminating laws is concerned, the South African government has to make sure that the new situation is not worse than the one we are trying to remove,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was quoted as saying Western countries should give <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> the time and chance to build and consolidate a system reflecting its specific situation. <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> also quoted <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as saying his government constantly considers freeing jailed black nationalist leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. `` We would be glad to release him, if it could happen in such a way that it would not cause renewed violence and conflicts,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was quoted as saying. He also rejected talks with the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement or any other groups that use violence. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader, many times has refused <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s offers of freedom because they are tied to a renunciation of violence.

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE pope arriving in Iceland, pleading for

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> pleaded for the reconciliation of all Christians on his arrival today in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, which has 1,800 Roman Catholics among its mainly Lutheran population of 244,000. Starting the second leg of a five-nation Scandinavian tour in one of the most unpolluted countries of the world, the pope also noted that people everywhere are beginning to recognize that the pursuit of materialism is threatening the environment. He also said people throughout the world are increasingly aware that peace among nations `` can only be the fruit of a just economic and social order.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Steingrimur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermannsson </PERSON> welcomed him at <LOCATION> Keflavik </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on a gray and chilly day, saying the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was received `` as a true servant of the God in whom we believe, regardless of the church to which we may belong.'' Christianity was established as the official church in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> 1,000 years ago, but <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholicism </ORGANIZATION> was vanquished by the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformation </ORGANIZATION> in the 16th century. The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said part of this 24-hour visit to <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> would `` seek to encourage the good relations which have developed between <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> Catholics and the members of other ecclesial communities.'' `` Despite the tragic divisions which have long separated Christians, all of us must try to live in fidelity to the lord's will, to be instruments of his reconciliation, to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. At the airport, the pope kissed the ground as soon as he stepped off his plane _ a gesture he makes in every country he visits for the first time. A crowd of youngsters waved Icelandic flags, and the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> kissed two young girls who presented him with flowers in the red, blue and white colors of <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s flag. The pope flew to this northernmost capital in the world, just below the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Tromsoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, where he extolled marriage and strong family values in a country where many couples live together without getting married. Police took into custody four people as the pope celebrated Mass in the market square of <ORGANIZATION> Tromsoe </ORGANIZATION>, which is 200 miles north of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>. Two women were detained for protesting closer relations with the Catholic church, and two men criticized the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s human rights record. Police estimated fewer than 1,000 people attended in one of the smallest crowds at an open-air Mass on the pope's 42 foreign trips. Speaking from a wooden altar, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> touched on an issue of concern to the churches in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, where about 50 percent of the couples never marry and most children today are born out of wedlock. `` The love of a married couple unites them, but it also enables them to become cooperators with God in giving life to a new person,'' he said, speaking in English. `` Thus they establish the most basic of human communities, the family,'' which he said was `` a fundamental gift.'' Catholic officials have complained of the difficulty of encouraging traditional values in a secular atmosphere. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> also is visiting <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> on his 10-day tour. Only about 1 percent of Scandanavians are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. Lutheran churches are tax-financed and part of the state bureaucracy.

<TEXT>
 One congressman compares the atmosphere in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> these days to the bloody battlefields of World War I `` where sticking your head out of the trench might get it shot at.'' Another calls up the memory of dirty tricks used by the <ORGANIZATION> Nixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to wage political warfare. An `` evil wind'' is blowing, says a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A Republican, <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, talks of the outbreak of `` ethics war.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, in shedding the speakership, said `` mindless cannibalism'' had been let loose. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members found that the political ground rules seemed to be shifting. The underlying habits of accommodation and accord were giving way to a cut-throat partisanship so intense it worried some. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, a former ethics committee chairman, said if the new mood persists `` the end result will be to destroy this institution as we know it today.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., said the Republicans should `` stop the war, if it's that, because the major concern we ought all to have at this point is the institution. What was new was the prospect of a siege of retribution in the House: the use of ethics charges as a political tool. That's not the tradition. In the past, when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> censured members for violating the rules, it did so as an institution acting as a whole against the transgressions of an individual. Democrats say they see the hand of newly installed Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s tormentor, behind the events which put them in disarray last week. Some suspected they were witness to, and victims of, a campaign that had its inspiration outside the House. `` The fear is that it is in the hands of the Lee Atwaters of the world,'' said <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` That's the concern. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, an aggressive political infighter, was a key strategist in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign last year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> installed him as Republican national chairman and <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> has set out to end 35 years of Democratic domination of the House. Republicans scoff at the cries of foul play. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> said in an interview that if there is poison in the air its source was the heavy-handed tactics by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as speaker _ stacking committees, restricting debate, maneuvering the minority into defeats. `` <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would use the rules in any way he could to manipulate the outcome of a vote,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. `` Republicans, and many Democrats, felt that it was n't just a matter of getting outvoted, it was a matter of not even having a fair shot.'' When <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said last week he was sorry if he had contributed to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s bitterness, `` that was ludicrous,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` He was responsible for it more than any human being.'' But <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> added that his fellow Republicans may be off on a dangerous game: `` Republicans have not cornered the market on morality.'' And Republican <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said his party has no appetite for escalation. `` There is a strong sense that we do n't want to start ethics wars,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't expect any Republicans to file charges against Democrats.'' On the other hand, Republican <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said ethics is a legitimate political issue. After all, he said, `` You've had two of the top three Democrats here resign.'' `` If the Democrats want to stop what <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called the ` mindless cannibalism,' the place to begin is to call off their vendetta against <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Democrats believe this is a concerted, planned, coordinated effort,'' said <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md., of the Republican hardball `` It is a continuation of the 1988 campaign.'' The reference, of course, was to events which caused <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to renounce the speakership and his seat after a long ethics investigation, led the ambitious Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the No. 3 Democrat, to resign from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rather than face an ethics investigation and led <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents to question <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., during the Memorial Day weekend about allegations of financial impropriety The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s visit occurred at an awkward time for Gray; seeking to move up in the Democratic hierarchy, he is a candidate for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s old job of whip <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said it all brought to mind tactics of the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> era: `` The <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> years showed us the ability to use executive apparatus in political campaigns.'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> called up the image of World War I trench warfare. He said he saw `` a World War I mentality'' at play in the use of ethics charges to savage the Democrats. If the get-even mood prevails, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> stands out as the Democrats' tempting target. A Democratic irritant in the best of times, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> is facing an investigation by the ethics committee on complaints much like those that brought <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> down. Members of both sides who want a truce look to the sure-to-be next speaker, Democrat <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He was universally praised as a conciliator, an intellectual, fair-minded and evenhanded. If he wants to add peacemaker to those accolades, opportunity awaits his elevation Tuesday to speaker.

<TEXT>
 The smells of the land and hard-working men filled the room as farmers took time off from the fields to hear Solidarity's election pitch. The trio of candidates faced a stern crowd in this village 42 miles west of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, where cows graze almost to the edge of the pavement and horse-drawn wagons rumble down the narrow roads. Like some other rural areas, <PERSON> Ojrzen </PERSON> remains a pocket of support for the communist party. There are fewer than a half-dozen Solidarity posters, with their flowing red script that has become a trademark for the trade union born in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> nine years ago. In his campaign stop, Solidarity candidate <PERSON> Benedykt </PERSON> <PERSON> Pszczolkowski </PERSON> called for reforms ranging from better treatment of farmers to reductions in the bloated communist-led government. But, facing more than 70 farmers in the community center Friday, he was careful to avoid raising too many expectations in advance of Sunday's elections for the parliament and a new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are n't making promises that the economy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will suddenly start to thrive,'' said the thin, bearded candidate, dressed in a natty sport coat at the end of a frenzied, two-month campaign. `` The people who control the farms do n't know the problems. For example, they're still buying machines that are too big for small operations,'' said the candidate, himself a farmer with 60 acres in the town of <LOCATION> Pszczolki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorne </LOCATION>, 18 miles away. <PERSON> Pszczolkowski </PERSON>, 38, is hitting emotional issues in a country where most farms remain in private hands, despite the communist system. He is well aware that party officials also have been making the rounds of hundreds of villages nationwide, promising to cure chronic shortages if they're given another chance to govern. Shortages in this country of 38 million people are a daily curse of life. They range from spare parts for tractors to food and vital parts for dental care. `` They are telling fairy tales,'' the Solidarity candidate said of the communist party candidates. Speaking from a makeshift podium of two tables pushed together and covered by an aging green satin cloth, <PERSON> Pszczolkowski </PERSON> said police should spend more time fighting crime than hunting down unauthorized newspapers. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Weglowski </PERSON>, 51, one of two other Solidarity candidates appearing at the campaign stop, called for legal and economic reforms. `` The factories are running at about 60 percent of their capacity, because there is a shortage of raw materials,'' said <PERSON> Weglowski </PERSON>, a parliament candidate. He also called for more housing, better education and public access to the state-dominated mass media. The candidates are bound to find that demanding sweeping reforms in virtually all aspects of public life is easier than implementing them. Solidarity chief <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has reminded his supporters that plenty of `` hard work'' remains after Sunday's voting and the run-off elections on June 18. When <PERSON> Pszczolkowski </PERSON> and the other candidates finished their presentations, they opened the floor to questions. One farmer wanted to know whether it was true, as state-run radio reported, that only `` criminals and communist party rejects'' joined Solidarity. Another testily asked whether Solidarity is a union or a political party. A third man asked why the candidates failed to mention `` the working class.''

About 150 farmers crowded into the community center to listen to the same speeches and pose many of the same questions as the farmers in <LOCATION> Ojrzen </LOCATION>. Communist party candidates have been keeping a much lower profile. `` Most people are for Solidarity,'' said retired farmer <PERSON> Sabina </PERSON> <PERSON> Walczewska </PERSON> as she sat in a wooden cart drawn by a tractor. `` Everyone here says with Solidarity things are going to change for the better _ maybe. Whether things really will be better, no one knows.'' The 73-year-old woman, her hands calloused from years on the land without modern machines, said she plans to vote for Solidarity.

<HEAD>Drought May Be in Remission, But Food Prices Still Headed Higher</HEAD>

 May rains have eased farmers' worries about another drought and have lowered grain prices, but consumers can probably still expect the biggest rise in food prices in eight years, economists say. `` It's 200 percent better. Last year was grim,'' says <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who farms 350 acres in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in north-central <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Generous spring rains provided a breather from drought in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and sent grain prices tumbling on commodity markets, but they have n't come close to replenishing parched soil deep down or washing out predictions for a food price increase of up to 7 percent. The drought of'88 reduced corn yields 30 percent nationwide and soybean production 20 percent. Then, a dry winter, coupled with dust storms and sub-arctic freezes, devastated winter wheat production, with 39 percent of that crop now deemed either in poor or very poor shape as the harvest approaches. Then came the rainy spring. Conditions have been so wet that planting has been delayed in such 1988 drought battlegrounds as <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. And the rain ensured that seeds that had been planted got the chance to germinate. `` We're not desperate,'' says agronomist <PERSON> Garren </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The pressure is off for the time being.'' Drought still plagues some parts of the country, `` but with the rain we've had in the Corn Belt, we know it certainly is n't going to be like last year,'' says economist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. The rains also have taken the edge off a drought-inspired rally in grain markets, where prices rise when a scarce supply is forecast and fall with each bit of good news from the fields. The rising dollar also has been a factor in depressing grain prices. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, contracts calling for September delivery of this summer's crop fell 9 percent for corn and almost 12 percent for soybeans between May 5 and Friday. At the height of the 1988 drought, corn for September 1988 delivery reached $ 3.64 a bushel. On Friday, the September 1989 contract closed at $ 2.42 -RCB-. Soybeans peaked at $ 10.70 a bushel nearly a year ago, but wound up last week at $ 6.50 \ But while the drought scare has diminished and commodity prices are retreating, economists are not rushing to rein in forecasts of rising prices at supermarkets and restaurants. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> recently revised upward its forecast for the consumer price index for food to a climb of 4 percent to 7 percent in 1989. In November, it had predicted a 3 percent to 5 percent increase in 1989 food prices. If inflation for food surpasses the 4.1 percent level of each of the past two years, it will hit the highest mark since the 7.8 percent level of 1981. <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> says drought aftereffects from 1988 are partly to blame. With rising costs for feed grain, egg production was cut back, pushing prices higher. Processed vegetable supplies also are tight because of the drought. The drought's lingering effects on pastures in cattle country also are taking their toll on food prices, by boosting feed costs and forcing ranchers and farmers to reduce herds. The 99.5 million head of cattle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the year began was the lowest since 1961. To help beef producers, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday announced steps to make some erosion-prone land available for grazing and hay cutting. Factors unrelated to the drought that are contributing to higher food prices include strong consumer demand and rising energy costs, which increase processing and transportation expenses. Sung Won Song, chief economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said May rains have not changed his inflation outlook. `` The drought outlook for this year is yet to be seen,'' Song said. Many regions are still powder dry below the top inches of soil, he noted. Subsoil moisture is rated inadequate in at least 80 percent of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, more than 90 percent of northern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, and virtually all of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. For corn and soybeans, June is a crucial month because it normally is one of the wettest times of the growing season. A dry June spells trouble in July and August, when such row crops are developing quickly and need plenty of moisture. `` We had a lot of rain in the spring. Now it's so dry, I keep planting, hoping it's going to rain,'' said former major league pitcher <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> `` Catfish'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, now a soybean farmer at <LOCATION> Hertford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` We do n't need 4 or 5 inches. We just need a little bit.'' And in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, rains were too little and too late to save much of the winter wheat crop. Central, north central and northeast parts of the state still are plagued with drought. `` A lot of people are thinking the drought is over,'' says <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, meteorologist in charge of the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` In May we had normal precipitation, and one month of normal precipitation does not a drought break.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is sending an agent to the site of the August plane crash that killed Pakistani President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>, an agency official confirmed. The agent will be sent within a week, nearly 10 months after the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was initially shut out of the investigation, said <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, executive assistant director for investigations. The aim will be to seek evidence at the site where the plane went down Aug. 17, killing the two officials and 27 others, including Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wassom </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense representative to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s official report on the crash has been under review by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> since October. It concludes that sabotage was the cause but does not pinpoint those responsible. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has completed its review of the report. `` We have conducted all of our interviews of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participants and witnesses and we are dispatching an agent to go on-scene to conduct an on-scene evaluation and we will go from there,'' he said. He said the decision to keep the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> out of the investigation appears to have come from within the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Pakistanis as we understand would have agreed for us to be there, but it was never presented to them,'' he said. `` I personally believe that this was a very unique situation, a very sensitive location with a U.s. ally teetering on the brink,'' <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said. `` People who did not know the requirements of the -LRB- anti-terrorism -RRB- law made a decision without understanding the ramifications of the decision.'' In more recent terrorist incidents, there has been cooperation between the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, has been critical of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s exclusion from the investigation, saying it is the only agency with the expertise to determine whether <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> were victims of terrorism `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is one of the key diplomatic posts,'' said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` Everybody said right away we could n't rule out sabotage. A proper criminal investigation was not carried out, whether for national security reasons, a turf battle, an understanding with the Pakistanis or an absolute blunder.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> had known <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and highly respected member of the diplomatic corps. `` I met <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> before he went to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` He was probably one of the rising stars.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' crime subcommittee has been trying to determine why the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 21 at first granted and then denied the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> permission to investigate the crash. `` It's not the first time I've seen potential criminal investigations thwarted,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` It's obvious somebody bungled the job.'' `` In this instance, nobody brought in any criminal investigators, no forensics experts, no autopsies were done on the pilots,'' he said. `` They did find foreign substances on the plane _ components suitable for a medium-size incendiary device which are not explained away.''

<HEAD>12,000 Gather for Biggest AIDS Conference Ever</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When 12,000 people gather Sunday for the biggest AIDS conference ever, they will hear grim reports on the social and economic toll of the epidemic but little encouragement about the medical race to stop it. The Fifth International Conference on AIDS is a gathering of all of the big-name researchers and physicians, as well as their supporting casts, who this decade have made AIDS a profession and livelihood as well as a tragedy. The obvious and easy discoveries have been made, so the product of the conference will be thousands of updates on the painstakingly tiny steps necessary for science to learn to thwart the AIDS virus and repair its destruction. No clearly superior successor to AZT, the only approved AIDS drug, is expected to emerge from the 4,500 planned presentations, nor is there likely to be an effective vaccine to protect people from catching HIV, the AIDS virus. `` I am not expecting any big announcements out of this conference, unfortunately, in terms of new drugs capable of making a real difference over the next two years,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wainberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we will see a lot of leads for the future, but I do n't think it likely we will have major cures or vaccines announced.'' In 1985, 3,200 people gathered in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for the first big AIDS meeting. At the time, 9,000 cases of AIDS had been reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Expected at the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> meeting, which runs through Friday, are 10,000 AIDS experts, 1,000 reporters and 1,000 exhibitors. The total of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AIDS cases is nearing 100,000. With the growing numbers has come a realization that acquired immune deficiency syndrome is far more than a medical problem. Although 65 percent of the presentations will concern the biological and medical intricacies of AIDS, this year's conference is the first to put a major emphasis on other aspects of the epidemic, including its psychological impact, costs, ethical dilemmas, education and legal questions. `` We encourage this marrying of disciplines,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Alastair </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>, director general of the federal center for AIDS in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. `` We are trying in this conference to keep the behavioral and biomedical sciences working together. We all want to control the spread of HIV infection in our society and use every means we can.'' Among other things, the meeting will hold sessions on AIDS legislation around the world, the hospital costs of the disease, the role of churches, how companies deal with the disease, whether HIV-infected people should be allowed to adopt children, and whether such people's infections should be kept confidential if they are sexually irresponsible. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON>, the conference chairman, said the decision to open the gathering to non-medical subjects was made even before last year's annual meeting in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, at the urging of its co-sponsor, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was a recognition that at the present pace of scientific research, there is likely to be considerable delay until we can come to terms with the virus in a scientific fashion,'' said <PERSON> Head </PERSON>, who is chairman of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the interim, we have to recognize these societal concerns.'' However, some researchers are uneasy about the vast scope of the meeting and the blurring of its focus on science. <PERSON> Wainberg </PERSON>, who is coordinating the meeting's research presentations, said that scientists undoubtedly will learn more about the ethics and economics of AIDS and its impact on Third World countries. But he added, `` I am afraid we may reach the conclusion that we tried to do too much. This meeting has tried to be all things to all people. There is a part of me that feels uneasy about it, but we'll see.'' Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Morisset </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hotel-Dieu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, the program chairman, agreed this is a familiar complaint. But he added, `` There will be more papers and posters in biomedicine than at any other meeting. I think the criticism is unimportant.''

<TEXT>
 The Soviet people have long thrived on so-called black humor, biting satire that make light of some of the more onerous aspects of a life characterized by shortages and corruption. Now the editors of the leading Soviet humor magazine, `` Krokodil,'' have published an English-language collection of satirical cartoons the magazine's editor, <PERSON> Aleksey </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyanov </PERSON> says he hopes will help `` destroy the myth that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people are gloomy, withdrawn and stern.'' The weekly `` Krokodil'' reaches an enormous audience in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with a circulation of 5.3 million. By comparison, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> has a circulation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sates </LOCATION> of 4.7 million and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> 3.3 million. The wide-ranging collection of 185 cartoons from `` Krokodil'' _ covering topics from marital humor to environmental problems _ is being made available to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> readers in the book, `` Soviet Humor.'' The most poignant sketches, ones that may surprise Western readers, are those depicting social problems, such as alcoholism or prostitution, the housing shortage, lethargic bureaucrats and workers. All are topics that `` Krokodil'' embraced satirically before it was politically safe to tackle them directly in official Soviet newspapers. Several selections reflect the terror of Stalinism, when a midnight knock at the door could mean a one-way ticket to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. In one, a wife consoles her husband that a noise from the next room is `` not the police. It's just burglars.'' In another, three road workers idle beneath a sign alerting motorists to beware of roadwork. In the final frame, the laborer depicted in the sign climbs down and bends his back to work, to the amazement of the idlers. Americans with memories of a bad restaurant meal might identify with the `` Krokodil'' cartoon of a slovenly chef handing a plate to a waitress with the comment: `` Palm this off on somebody _ I am afraid to taste it.'' Another cartoon helps explain shortages in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> restaurants. As the manager leaves, loaded down with fish, ham and other goodies, the chef calls to the waitress: `` Klava, the boss has left for the day. Take all the meat and fish items off the menu.'' A number of cartoons are more tragic than funny. A woman walks down the street, carrying groceries in one hand and leading a child with the other. The child's far hand is raised, grasping a shadow of a man, who with his other hand clutches a half-empty bottle of vodka.

<HEAD>Judge Lifts Jail Term for `Exorcist' Who Plucked Out Boy's Eye</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman who plucked out a teen-ager's eye during an exorcism wo n't have to go to jail after all, says the judge who sentenced her last year to a six-month term District Judge <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>, who was convicted in June 1988 of cruelty to a juvenile, to buy an $ 850 artificial eye for the boy. Mrs. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> was pregnant when <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> sentenced her in October 1988, and he said she would not have to go to jail until after she gave birth. In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> said Friday, the prosecutor urged him not to send Mrs. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> to jail. She has expressed remorse and her probation officer describes her as an ideal candidate for probation, the judge said. Mrs. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison on the cruelty charge. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said he originally ordered Mrs. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> to serve jail time, as well as doing 300 hours of community service and paying nearly $ 4,000 in restitution, to punish her for committing a crime in the name of Christianity. `` In this day of the various scandals which have been widely publicized, the last thing the Christian cause needs is this type of additional adverse publicity,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said at the time.

 Chinese troops fired on protesters and smashed through barricades with tanks to reach Tiananmen Square early Sunday. At least 13 people were reported killed and scores injured. A doctor at a small hospital near where the clashes occurred said about 100 people were treated for injuries and that 12 had died. A soldier was killed in another part of the city when he was run over by a tank racing to the square. Thousands of troops armed with rifles marched up the east side of the vast square, which has been occupied by pro-democracy protesters for three weeks. Until Saturday, the tense standoff had been generally peaceful, even though the students were repeatedly ordered to leave the square and end the protest. Students threw bottles and other objects at soldiers who advanced Saturday night, while troops beat those who obstructed their path with sticks. Another group of more than 1,000 troops gained a foothold on the southwest corner of the vast square, while throngs of students and supporters tried to block their movement. A tank pulled up next to the Great Hall of the People, on the western side of the square, but it was besieged by crowds pelting it with rocks. Another tank roared down <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the main street, from the east, followed by thousands of shouting people on bicycles. Other tanks crashed through barricades in the west. The street where the gunfire took place was speckled with blood. Crowds broke up the pavement to throw stones at the troops and set one military bus on fire. Late Saturday, a convoy of at least 40 trucks with several thousand troops broke through the barricades set up by people and began moving slowly down <ORGANIZATION> Changan </ORGANIZATION> Avenue toward the square. Shortly after 1 a.m. Sunday -LRB- noon EDT Saturday -RRB- troops broke through a flaming barricade at the Xidan intersection, about one mile west of the square. A man at the intersection about a mile west of the square received a gunshot wound in the chest as truckloads of troops rammed through barricades set up by citizens. A medical student on the scene said the man's heart had stopped beating and there was little hope for his survival. About 6,000 people trying to block the path of the troops were beaten by riot police and troops and attacked with tear gas. Citizens had set fire to public buses parked across the road, but the army trucks slammed through. At least five people were taken away after being hit by the fire in the initial incident. More than a dozen others were bleeding from wounds suffered when troops beat people in the crowd. One 28-year-old worker hit by a bullet in the leg said, `` the government is fascist. How can they do this to me? How can they do this to the people?'' The attack on protesters first began about 8 p.m. Saturday when thousands of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> citizens trying to push the troops back began hurling stones. Police retaliated by attacking people with truncheons and electric cattle prods, firing tear gas and finally opening fire. About 5,000 troops made a dash for the square from the east earlier in the evening, but they were turned back and headed up a side street. One student speaking in a cracked voice over a loudspeaker on the square urged students not to leave and said, `` We Chinese will persist to the end. If we die at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, then so be it.'' About 200,000 people were gathered on the square to protect the thousands of students who have staged a pro-democracy sit-in there since May 13. The pro-democracy protests began on April 15 with a simple call by students for talks on increasing social freedoms and ending official corruption. They peaked during the week of May 15, when Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visited the country and up to 1 million poured into the streets. The government declared martial law on May 20 and troops attempted to advance on the square, but they were driven back by masses of average citizens sympathetic to the protesters. The protest led to a power struggle in the government, with hardliners such as senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> apparently winning control. The shooting Saturday night came after an earlier attempt to quell the protests failed earlier in the day. Hundreds of police had fired tear gas on crowds for the first time in seven weeks of pro-democracy protests. Witnesses said riot troops beat at least 30 people east of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. But hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protect the students. A detachment of 5,000 troops, surrounded by taunting crowds one block off the square, began hitting people with belts. During the short fracas, people burst into tears and the crowd shouted `` You ca n't hit the people!'' Security forces made pre-dawn and afternoon advances on the square but failed to dislodge the students, who have occupied the 100-acre plaza since May 13. Riot police also beat students and others with nightsticks in afternoon attacks both to the east and west of the square, the symbolic center of power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Some protesters tossed rocks at the police. At least 13 people were seen with bloodied heads and bodies. Witnesses said two truckloads of riot police with shields and sticks began beating people outside the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> east of the square, injuring 30 people. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, a reformer who advocated concessions to the students, has reportedly lost his post and is under house arrest. But Chinese and diplomatic sources said it was unclear whether hard-liners had enough support among the rest of the party leadership to purge <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> from the government.

<HEAD>Accountant's Arrest Helps Exorcise Town's 18-Year-Old Crime</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Eighteen years after authorities say <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> List </PERSON> methodically shot his family to death, people here see an end to the tale that has haunted this quiet, wealthy suburb. The former Sunday school teacher was arrested in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, last Thursday, where he had been living with a second wife of four years and working as an accountant. Nearly two decades of lead-chasing in every state, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> were terminated by a simple anonymous tip following a broadcast of the case on the television show `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted.'' Police Chief <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Scutti </PERSON> said the murders left a black mark on the town of 32,000, 25 miles from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The arrest helped fade that mark. `` If they had a giant microphone in town, you would have heard a giant sigh of relief,'' <PERSON> Scutti </PERSON> said. When the chief went to an awards dinner the night of the arrest, he was greeted with a spontaneous standing ovation. `` I think that reflected the feeling of all of us,'' he said. On Dec. 7, 1971, police who had been alerted by worried neighbors found the bodies of List's wife and three children lying on sleeping bags on the ballroom floor of the family's 18-room mansion. Cloths covered the faces of <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, 45; <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, 16; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> 15; and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, 13. The body of List's 85-year-old mother, <PERSON> Alma </PERSON>, was found in an upstairs closet. All five had been shot in the head. They apparently had been dead nearly a month. List, who had held jobs as an accountant and insurance salesman and was apparently beset by financial and family problems, had vanished. In many ways, the List case worked its way into the town's consciousness Teen-agers seeking excitement would cruise by the house, until it mysteriously burned down a year after the deaths. Almost every year, newspapers would run articles on the crime's anniversary And people remembered. <PERSON> Scutti </PERSON>, then a sergeant, recalled bringing <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> List </PERSON> to the stationhouse late one night several months before her death. She had slipped out the window and was going to meet a friend. `` Lo and behold, he comes in at 2:30 in the morning dressed in a business suit to pick up his daughter,'' <PERSON> Scutti </PERSON> said. List, <PERSON> Scutti </PERSON> said, sometimes dressed the same way to mow his lawn. <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Haller </PERSON> remembered being interviewed by List for a teaching job at the primary school connected with the Redeemer Lutheran Church. The red-brick, slate-roofed church, where List taught Sunday school, was just about the only community tie he had. Church was a constant: He used pastors as references for jobs and a gun permit three weeks before the crime. List met his second wife at a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> church function in 1977, authorities said. `` I felt that he was a very intellectual man. He was just very calm and collected. You could see he was a very religious man, too,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Haller </PERSON> said. He was also a private man, given to eating lunch alone at work, said <ORGANIZATION> Westfield </ORGANIZATION> detective Lt. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>. Now that one mystery _ List's whereabouts _ has been solved, another remains: why. List left letters, as yet undisclosed, to his pastor and others explaining his actions. List reportedly believed his family was falling away from their religion and had to be killed for their own good. A newspaper at the time included quotations from <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> List </PERSON>'s daughter by a previous husband who had died in the Korean War. Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the marriage with List was filled with tension because her mother was psychologically unstable and had a drinking problem. List's Lutheran pastor in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, during the early 1960s said more tension was created by Mrs. List's comparison of the meek List with her first husband, `` a strong military man.'' Toward the end, Mrs. List was bedridden for months and List's financial problems were mounting He was upset with his daughter's desire to become an actress and attachment to a young man considered in the `` wrong crowd,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, police chief at the time The young man for several years left flowers at the family's grave in <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>, where a single headstone records List's wife and `` I hope it ends for him more than it does for us,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Pletscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fanwood </LOCATION>, who was two years behind <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in school. `` I hope he comes to grips with this whole thing.''

 Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, recovering from surgery for bleeding in his digestive system, has developed a `` complication,'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported Saturday. The radio gave no details of the deterioration in the 86-year-old spiritual leader's condition but urged the nation to pray for his recovery. The broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, contained a statement from <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s office that said: `` At 3:00 p.m. -LRB- 7:30 a.m. EDT -RRB- on Saturday a complication arose in the Imam's condition, which the doctors are trying to control. We urge the nation to pray for the Imam's health and hope that their prayers will be answered.'' The deterioration in <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s condition followed reports over the past five days that he was making a normal recovery. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> underwent surgery 11 days ago to control intestinal bleeding. A few days after the operation, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said a `` slight cardiac complication'' had arisen, but that it had been relieved the next day. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is referred to by Iranians as the Imam, or spiritual leader. On Thursday, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was allowed out of bed in a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hospital and visited with friends and relatives outside the building, the television said. It showed film of the revolutionary patriarch sitting outside performing his prayers. The report quoted doctors as saying <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s condition was `` very satisfactory'' and that he was expected to make a complete recovery. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement earlier this week that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> suffered a heart attack last Saturday The statement said the heart attack came five days after he underwent surgery on the duodenum, part of the small intestine close to the stomach. The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>'s claim could not be independently confirmed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> reportedly has been ailing since he had a heart attack in 1986. Since then he has rarely been seen outside his home in the north <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Jamaran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the son of a religious leader from a village southwest of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, taught for years at <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, the center of Shiite teaching in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He attracted attention for his independent-mindedness and stern moral example and soon became a focus for opposition to the monarchy in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He was sent into exile in November 1964, first to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, where he settled in the Shiite shrine city of <LOCATION> Najaf </LOCATION>. He later moved to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> emerged in 1978 as the moral leader of a burgeoning revolution against the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> that was organized through <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Shiite clergymen and their followers. He returned to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in February 1979 after the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> fled the country and became the supreme head of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic revolution for life. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> developed into a skilled politician balancing the different Iranian factions against each other but never losing his power as leader of the theocratic state. When <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s eight year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> ended in a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in August, there was speculation <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> would back more moderate members of the Iranian regime in their efforts to rebuild the war-ravaged country. But his radicalism re-emerged in February with a purge of those members of the hierarchy and a call for the death of British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for his irreverant portrayal of Islam in his novel, `` The Satanic Verses.''

 Syrian gunners blasted the Christian enclave with 400 howitzer shells at dawn Saturday, and five artillery rounds crashed in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in the most serious violations of a 3-week-old cease-fire. A spokesman for Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> denied that his mainly Christian army troops fired on west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It was the first attack on west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> called the May 11 cease-fire. But the spokesman warned: `` We wo n't remain idle if the cease-fire violations persist.'' No casualties were reported. Police said they could not determine who fired on the Moslem sector, but Moslem-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> radio blamed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army. An aide to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> accused the Syrians of `` shelling both sectors of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> so that our citizens in the western sector would have the impression that we are shelling them.'' The barrage on the Christians focused on the coastal stretch north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the presidential palace and nearby districts. In west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, shells exploded along the seaside Raouche boulevard. Two shells crashed close to the American University campus. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Arab League talks on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> being held Sunday in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> will be decisive. `` Peace will prevail if the leaders adopt a clear decision on consolidating the cease-fire and lifting the blockades,'' he said. `` If they fail to stop Syrian violation of the cease-fire, then we will have to fire back,'' he added. <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> will host the talks with King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>. An Arab League summit gave the three men six months to stabilize the May 11 truce and find a political settlement to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year civil war. The daily <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the three plan to set up an office in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It said their foreign ministers will hold talks in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to help consolidate the cease-fire. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> supports <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s `` war of liberation'' to drive out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> some 40,000 Syrian troops deployed under a 1976 Arab League peace-keeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and his supporters accuse the Syrians of betraying the mandate by siding with the Moslems. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are ruled by rival wings of the Arab socialist Baath party. At least 360 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 have been wounded since the latest fighting erupted March 8, two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> ports run by Syrian-backed militias. The illegal harbors deprive the state treasury of $ 100 million in customs dues annually. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s Syrian-backed militia retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian heartland northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Syrian gunners later joined in the shelling and enforced a siege of the enclave where 1 million Christians live.

<HEAD>Soviets Charge Britain With Bugging Soviet Building, Apartments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Saturday accused <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of bugging its trade delegation building in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the apartments of Soviet diplomats. The Foreign Office denied the allegation, which further strained relations between the countries. Two weeks ago, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> accused eight Soviet diplomats and three journalists of spying and expelled them. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> responded with identical charges and expulsions. Soviet diplomats said at a news conference at their embassy on Saturday that construction work on the trade delegation building revealed that it was `` honeycombed'' with bugging devices planted in the concrete walls and even deep underground. Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamyatin </PERSON> went to the Foreign Office in the afternoon to deliver `` a vigorous protest,'' the diplomats said. The Soviets claimed the electronic devices were so powerful that they would harm the health of Soviet citizens and Britons living nearby. He did not explain how. First Secretary <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Smaguin </PERSON> said some of the alleged bugs `` were discovered very recently.'' `` They were discovered during maintenance and repair work carried out over some period of time by Soviet construction workers,'' he said. `` Obviously these devices could only be installed during the contruction of the building about 15 years ago,'' said <PERSON> Nickolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Kossov </PERSON>, another first secretary. The Soviets displayed photographs of the alleged eavesdropping devices, graphics of where they were found and examples of the devices themselves. Reporters and photographers later were taken by bus to one of the diplomat's flats where the devices were allegedly found. A statement issued by Soviet Counselor <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Karasin </PERSON> said: `` Facts show that in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> there remain active forces, keen on bringing our relations back to the times of the Cold War, reanimating the ` enemy image' of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' He said the surveillance amounted to `` rude intrusion in private lives of Soviet citizens working in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' `` By expert opinion, the mode of operation of many of the discovered devices involved the use of high-powered directional radio emissions damaging to the health of both Soviet personnel and British people living locally,'' <PERSON> Karasin </PERSON> said. After <PERSON> Zamyatin </PERSON>'s 10-minute meeting with Sir <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, permanent secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the department issued a statement that said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was certain the British government had nothing to do with any bugging devices found on Soviet property. `` Devices of this sort are widely available both in this country and, indeed, in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' the statement said.

 <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> graduates in their black academic robes gathered among the university's ancient spires on Saturday and elected Irish poet <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> to the prestigious post of professor of poetry. <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON>, an award-winning poet and favorite of the university's arts establishment, was born in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and lives in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he is a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> He is 50.

It requires three lectures for each of its five years. <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. Telephone calls to his office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> went unanswered, and his home telephone number was not listed. The highly regarded and popular poet was nominated by <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> novelist <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, by three previous holders of the professorship and by <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION>'s most influential English literature specialists. In addition to his poetry, <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> has published books of literary criticsm and has long experience teaching. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letters </ORGANIZATION>, he became Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, in 1985. Competition for the professorship, though dignified, has been intense. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisson </PERSON>, a 75-year-old poet, author and translator was a notable contender and garnered 96 votes. An attention-getting outsider was 30-year-old Rastafarian reggae poet <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zephaniah </PERSON>, who was a candidate for the post of writer in residence at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and only narrowly missed. He had the backing of younger graduates but, as columnist <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> wrote in The Independent newspaper: `` Dialect is notoriously difficult to transliterate in English ... -LRB- so -RRB- his work looks no more than silly on paper, but that is not how he is to be judged.'' `` He is said to be very impressive in live performance,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Zephaniah </PERSON> won 60 votes. He was followed by <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, with nine votes. <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> lost to current professor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> five years ago. <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> was so indignant at being referred to as `` the barroom poet'' because of his nomination by friends from The King's Arms in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> that some papers took to calling him `` not the barroom poet.'' In addition to the three lectures the poetry professor gives each year, he must judge three English poetry and essay competitions for students and give a public oration every other year. From the establishment of the professorship in 1708 until 1972, the oration had to be delivered in Latin _ a task which alone might merit the professor's annual stipend of $ 4,960. But in 1972 <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> got away with delivering his in English and successors have followed suit. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> delivered his last oration in verse. Previous sitters in the illustrious poetry chair have included W.H. <PERSON> Auden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunden </PERSON>.

 A mahogany desk and bookcase made in the 1760s sold at auction Saturday for $ 12.1 million, setting a world record for a piece of furniture, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house said. The Chippendale secretary was bought by <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Sack </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dealer, after a three-way bidding contest that lasted about a minute, said <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Micucci </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s. `` It was a very dynamic event. People rushed up to Sack. And basically the sale stopped while they applauded him,'' she said. The desk, made for <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, is attributed to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>, a renowned cabinetmaker from <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> Nine known <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> six-shell secretaries are known to exist. The desk soars to a dramatic 113 inches. The upper section is divided into three blocked cupboard doors, each carved with a shell. The lower case has a slant lid blocked and carved with three shells. `` This particular piece is probably the consummate example of 18th century American furniture,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Failey </PERSON>, head of <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s American decorative arts department. `` It is perhaps <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s finest contribution in the history of furniture making.'' The auction house had predicted that the desk would sell for $ 3 million to $ 5 million. The $ 12.1 million includes <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s 10 percent commission. The previous record for a piece of furniture was held by <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON>'s console table, which sold for $ 2.97 million last November in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The $ 12.1 million is the highest price paid for any art object other than a painting, according to the auction house. <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> made the desk for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and his wife, whom he married in 1762, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> family correspondence indicates. The family made its fortune in shipping and commerce in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, R.I. The desk remained in the <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> family until December 1988, when a descendant and namesake of the original owner, retired Capt. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, donated it to the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Center </PERSON> for the Study of American Civilization in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>. The center sold the piece of furniture because it needed funds to repair its headquarters, the <LOCATION> Nightingale-Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, where the family lived until 1983, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emlen </PERSON>, executive director of the center.

<HEAD>Ousted Sudanese Leader Still Plots to Seize Back Power</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four years after he was ousted in a palace coup, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s former president, <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>, spends his time in large, slightly decrepit villa, plotting to seize power again. He has aged visibly and put on weight during the years as a political outcast in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. The villa and the guards patrolling it with automatic weapons are courtesy of the Egyptian government, which granted <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> political asylum after he was stranded in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> by his defense minister's coup. <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> had just returned from an aid-seeking visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on April 6, 1985 when Gen. <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Swareddahab </PERSON> sided with civil disobedience campaigners to oust him. <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> had been in power 16 years. During a rare interview Friday, the former strongman wore a white suit instead of the military uniform or traditional flowing white robes he favored as president of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest country. He spoke of his anger at his defense minister's betrayal, his life as an exile, the `` government of thieves'' ruling his country and his advice to Sudanese supporters: `` Take over the power.'' The 59-year-old <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> said he socializes mostly with Sudanese who live in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> or visit <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and has little contact with his Egyptian benefactors other than requesting renovations for the villa. His kinky hair has turned almost totally white behind his receding hairline. His waistline has expanded into a pot belly. <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> claimed overwhelming support in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and urged his countrymen to overthrow Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>, elected in 1986 in balloting overseen by <PERSON> Swareddahab </PERSON>'s transitional military government. `` I have felt hurt by the news I get from <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and about the suffering of the Sudanese people,'' <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> said. `` Those who were deceived now call for the regime of <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>. ... I have received numerous letters and people, all asking me to save <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> after it has fallen in a deep abyss as they put it.'' <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> was near bankruptcy when <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> was overthrown, and little has changed. Experts blame a succession of weak coalitions' reticence to undertake reforms and work decisively to end a civil war that began in 1983 Sudanese appear disillusioned by <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s lack of progress, and some have been heard to speak wistfully of the <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> era, but there is no visible support for the ousted president on the streets. <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> insisted in the interview that the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> he ruled was among the world's most democratic and prosperous countries. But in 1985, thousands of Sudanese danced in the streets after demonstrations against high prices, <PERSON> Islamic </PERSON> law and <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>'s iron-fisted security policies led to the coup Similar demonstrations have rocked the country this year and, under pressure from the military, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> was forced to form a broader-based coalition and prepare to negotiate with the rebels. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s government has convicted several members of <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>'s military regime for corruption and has a standing request that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> return the field marshal for trial President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has refused, invoking <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s long tradition of providing political asylum. <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>'s presence in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> has strained <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s relations with its southern neighbor. Twice the former leader has broken his hosts' ban on political activity. In 1985, he sent recorded messages to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> urging people to restore his power. This year, he has given a handful of interviews and admitted sending tapes and written speeches to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> to mark the 20th anniversary of his seizure of power. <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> has expressed displeasure, `` but the pressure on me from the Sudanese people does not allow me to keep my word to the Egyptian government. `` I am not urging the people to overthrow the government. I am urging them to take over the power.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> convened a full-time legislature Saturday after eight days of raucous parliamentary debate, which President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said showed how his reforms activate people. At its first session, the 271-member Soviet of the Union, one of two chambers of the Supreme Soviet legislature, chose economist <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON> as chairman and proposed creating four commissions and 14 committees, including one to oversee the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police. <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON> said the committees are modeled in part on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting, broadcast to the nation, brought the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the second phase of its adventure in democracy. The larger <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, the parliament, adjourned until Monday after boisterous debate that brought up a catalogue of problems with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika, or restructuring, of Soviet economy and society. `` During the days of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' work, I became sure that perestroika changes people fast,'' the 58-year-old Soviet leader told legislators Saturday. He said the 2,250 deputies, most elected in competitive balloting for the first time in 70 years, are `` wonderful people, different people, dissimilar people very interested in things starting to change in the country for the better.'' `` How these perestroika processes bring out, crystallize these new cadres!'' he said. The Soviet of the Union met for just one day. The other chamber, the Soviet of Nationalities, meets Monday, and a joint session is scheduled Tuesday to consider the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s nomination of Politburo member <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> to continue as premier. The two chambers replace a larger parliament that automatically approved government decisions. <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON> urged the new Supreme Soviet to `` exercise real control over executive organs.'' Vice President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON> said the committee on defense and state security, which will oversee the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, will meet less frequently and have fewer members than others. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a legislator and historian who has written extensively about dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s secret police and mass terror, said the committee can demand explanations of any <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> official and recommend changing <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> decisions. But he said it was too soon to tell if it can exercise true control over the secretive agency. `` Everything depends on its composition. If it is made up of people who are ... not independent, who are timid people, people who do n't have enough will or intellectual abilities, then of course it will be a committee that ca n't completely carry out its functions,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said in an interview. <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> said Thursday he supports legislative authority over his agency. Some parliamentarians have expressed concern that few progressive-minded people have been elected to the Supreme Soviet. Saturday's session was much tamer than the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but dissent was evident. <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristin </PERSON>, from the grassroots <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estonia </ORGANIZATION>, joined two Lithuanians in abstaining in the <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON> vote, because, she said, he did not reject description of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an empire or power. Baltic activists want a degree of sovereignty for the 15 Soviet republics. There were no votes against <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>. He was the only candidate.

 They met on the bus and became friends on the bus. So when it came to getting married Saturday, it seemed only natural that <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Methot </PERSON> and Jan Cole should board the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> to take their vows. The couple left a wake of smiles and horn-honking motorists as their wedding bus cruised to a luncheon after the onboard ceremony. The bus was decked out with crepe paper, paper bells and strings of tin cans tied to the bumper. And, of course, a `` Just Married'' sign. `` Both of us are bus people,'' said <PERSON> Methot </PERSON>, 40, a paper company employee who lives in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Methot </PERSON> said he and his bride became close friends a few months after they met while riding the bus to work together. `` There are some very nice people on the bus, but I never thought I'd meet anyone, and never thought I'd get married, on a bus,'' said the 41-year-old bride, who works as a salesperson. `` It's one of the craziest things I've done in my life.'' Metro General Manager <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> deDoes </PERSON> said she was for the ceremony from the start. `` Being a romantic myself, when they asked me, I thought it was just great,'' she said. Asked about the couple's honeymoon plans, <PERSON> Methot </PERSON> said, `` It wo n't be Greyhound, that's for sure. We're going to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> in the fall _ they have a good bus system there.''

 Hundreds of people turned out to labor with shovels and bare hands for their moment of fame _ as builders of the world's longest sand sculpture. After crews worked much of the day under a hot June sun, a surveying company certified Friday that the sand castle measured 15,063 feet, giving the crew a good shot at getting into the next <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. The centerpiece of the project, a 15-foot-high castle with the logos of corporate sponsors, had been built earlier in the week by two leading sand sculptors, <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander-Pluym </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamar </PERSON>. Then, volunteers made two long, long wings on the building Friday, following guide lines painted on the beach and taking care to sculpt the sand and not just pile it up. Festival chairman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Snipes-Phillips </PERSON> said the surveyors' findings, along with videotape, photographs, and volunteers' signatures, will be sent to the Guinness Book of World The castle would appear to easily beat the 10,760-foot-long sand millipede built along <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, in March 1987, which is listed in the 1989 Guinness book. Estimates of the number of folks manning the shovel brigades or otherwise helping on the project ranged up to 2,000. `` It's tough, but I think we'll make it,'' said one volunteer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>. The castle was called `` The Neverending Fantasy'' and included sculptings of a jet plane, a `` Jungle Lagoon Golf Course,'' a shark and a castle turret topped with a tiny cocktail umbrella. The project was part of the city's six-day Sun Fun Festival which opened on Friday. By Saturday, much of the castle remained, but the tide had already begun to wash away parts of it.

The 76-year-old Polish native left this <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> seashore community Friday to return home the same way he came, bound for <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> aboard the 24-foot Tawny Pipit. He has no radio transmitter and plans to navigate by sun and stars.

<TEXT>
 On a lava field where Christianity was proclaimed in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> nearly a thousand years ago, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> appealed Saturday for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> unity and primacy of moral values. The pope focused on the weakening of family life and reconciliation among Christians in this country where 2,300 of the 244,000 people are <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, and where more people play than worship on Sundays. <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> was the second stop on the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s five-nation visit to <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, a Lutheran stronghold where the 16th century Protesant Reformation swept away Catholicism and the current affluent lifestyle has eroded traditional values of the church. He chose an ecumenical service at <LOCATION> Thingvellir </LOCATION> _ where the world's oldest parliament was founded in 930 and Christianity was proclaimed the national religion over paganism in 1000 _ to urge all Christians to `` heal the wounds of division and re-establish unity.'' He spoke in English peppered with a few words of Icelandic to the congregation of several hundred seated against a backdrop of spectacular snow-covered mountains: `` It is essential to recover an awareness of the primacy of moral values, to reflect on the ultimate meaning of life and its transcendent destiny ... `` The fact is that families are facing new and serious pressures which can only be met by a renewed and deeper respect for life and love.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigurgeirsson </PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and leader of the Lutheran church, said he did n't want `` to belittle'' issues dividing the Christian churches. `` But in actual fact, the importance of the things that separate dwindles when viewed in the light of that which unites. It is the faith in Christ which unites us,'' he said. Some of <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s 17 women Lutheran ministers boycotted the service. The Rev. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Petursdottir </PERSON> said they were protesting the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to allow women into the priesthood. By Icelandic standards, security was tight for the papal visit. The communist newspaper <PERSON> Thjodviljinn </PERSON> noted he had six bodyguards and that the entire <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> police force was mobilized. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Tromsoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, where he extolled marriage and strong family values before fewer than 1,000 people. It was one of the smallest open-air Masses of his 42 foreign trips. Like Icelanders, many people live together in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> without getting married. Police at <LOCATION> Tromsoe </LOCATION> detained four people _ two fundamentalist women protesting ecumenism and two men criticizing the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s human rights record When the pontiff arrived at <LOCATION> Keflavik </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for the 24-hour stop in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Steingrimur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermannsson </PERSON> welcomed him `` as a true servant of the God in whom we believe, regardless of the church to which we may belong.''

<TEXT>
 New Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> promises to reform the scandal-tainted government, but he faces the task of fixing a factious political system that not only helped cause his country's crisis but also put him in power Soon after <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was chosen by the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to replace outgoing Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> as party president, the former foreign minister promised `` to carry forward political reforms with all my loyalty and strength.'' He said the reforms include abolishing the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' rival factions, which create formidable power blocs but force leaders to raise huge sums of money to support their followers' political That need for money is believed to have led the party leadership into seeking the quick profits and large donations offered by companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The publishing conglomerate sold stock at cut-rate prices to politicians and bureaucrats it hoped to influence. They made handsome profits after the stock went public, and the scandal forced <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> out of office. `` I agree with those who say these are not times to be forever building factions,'' Uno told reporters Friday. But analysts say that exorcizing the party of its blocs would be a monumental task and perhaps an impossible one for Uno, the first president in the 34-year history of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to have no faction of his own to fall back on. Nearly all legislators from the party are divided into six major factions _ the largest headed by <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> _ that have typically been allotted power in the party and Cabinet roughly equal to their number of seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Faction loyalty usually decides how individual lawmakers will vote on important issues. Leading the second - and third-strongest factions are outgoing party Secretary General <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> and former Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, who have both been implicated in the Recruit scandal Though <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> stressed that he did not ask each faction to submit a `` wish list'' for posts in his Cabinet, an accepted party practice, the factional balance of power clearly figured in his appointments. Joining Uno at the helm of the governing party are <PERSON> Keijiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Murata </PERSON>, of the Abe faction; <PERSON> Kiyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizuno </PERSON>, of the <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> faction; and <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>, of the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> faction. The new 21-member Cabinet, including Uno, has six members from <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s faction, five from <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>'s, four each from <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>'s and former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s and one each from smaller factions. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> resigned from the faction that was until Wednesday headed by <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, whose 1982-87 tenure covered the period when the Recruit scandal developed. Deeply embroiled in the affair, <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> has given up leadership of his faction, the Liberal Democrats' fourth largest, and resigned from the party. The faction is expected to remain intact under new leadership. Concern remains over whether <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> will be independent of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, who will retain his seat in the lower house. `` He will be a <LOCATION> Takeshita </LOCATION> puppet, because that is where he will get his support,'' said political analyst and author <PERSON> Asao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> said that without a faction of his own, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> has no clear power base and will be forced to rely heavily on those who do. `` There has been no change at all in the basics, or the Liberal Democrats' attitude,'' <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> said. `` The -LRB- party -RRB- is now and always will be a coalition of factions. They like it that way.'' To end a rift in 1987, <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> handpicked <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> as his successor, and it was widely believed that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, in turn, promised to pass the reins on to <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, his close friend. <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, too tainted by Recruit money to replace <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> now, reportedly hopes to succeed Uno when the Recruit dust settles. At a news conference on Saturday, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> denied his government was only an interim one. `` It is not an interim Cabinet, and I can tell you that it will be a Cabinet which will be highly appraised,'' he said. The most pressing task for Uno will be to reverse low public approval ratings for his party before next month's elections for the upper house of parliament. The Liberal Democrats have controlled both houses of parliament since 1955, but political observers say the party could lose its hold on government as a result of the Recruit scandal. Of the 17 politicians or aides involved in purchases of cut-rate stock offered by Recruit, 13 were Liberal Democrats.

 Moslem guerrillas killed five people and wounded six in a rocket attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Saturday, and 100 more people were killed in fighting in the cities of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, the government said. It urged Prime Ministr <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to use her trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week to persuade the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to cut off arms supplies to the guerrillas and help negotiate an end to the 11-year-old Afghan war. The attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> started early Saturday, with one rocket hitting near a kindergarten, then continued through the night in one of the most intense attacks in more than a month. Military observers said the rockets were fired from the surrounding hills and appeared to be within close range, but they could not give the distance. The armed forces responded by firing artillery and machine guns into the hills. The 12 rockets that fell Saturday raised to 23 the number that have hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> since Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. Twelve people were killed and 13 wounded in the earlier attacks, ministry spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. He said fighting between the guerrillas and forces of the Soviet-backed government occurred in the besieged eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and the southern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and that at least 100 people died and 36 were injured. The report could not be independently verified. Before Saturday, the insurgents, who are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, had said an attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was imminent. But <ORGANIZATION> Amni </ORGANIZATION> scoffed at their claims, saying the fractious resistance was incapable of mounting a real offensive on the city. `` Some time ago, they said they would carry out an extensive attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. But they have been unable to carry this out. A rocket fired from 25 miles away can not be considerd an attack,'' he said. The guerrilla's rockets, with a range of 15-35 miles, are generally fired by remote control from the mountains that ring the city. They often land in residential areas rather than hitting military or government intallations. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said four civilians were killed and six wounded in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, a city 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that has been under a guerrilla siege March 7. Afghan soldiers killed 72 guerrillas and injured 21 in an operation to clear the insurgents from the city and the areas near the airport, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, once <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, one civlian was killed and two injured by rockets, he said Government troops retaliated by attacking rebel positions 20 miles from the city and killing 23 guerrillas and wounding seven, he said. Elsewhere, five rockets slammed into the southern garrison town of <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said, but there were no casualties. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to reconsider its policy toward <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and cut off the flow of weapons to the guerrillas. `` The Afghan government hopes a policy change will be made during Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> has called for a political settlement to the Afghan war but also has said peace talks should not include members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> recently has stepped up his call for peace talks and offered to negtotiate with the opposition and its Western backers without conditions. `` Why does the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> not help restore peace instead of supplying more arms to the enemy,'' <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. `` Is a country that calls itself an advocate of human rights to act like this? We consider this irresponsible.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it will continue to supply weapons to the guerrillas as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continues to aid <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government

 Police detained 21 people as leftist demonstrators hurled eggs, tomatoes, stink bombs and paint at about 1,000 supporters of an extreme right party. The protest occurred during an election rally of the <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, whose views often are compared to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Party candidates for June 18 elections to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> are calling for foreigners to be driven out of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The party also opposes most European Community policies. About 1,000 leftists tried to disrupt the rally and 2,000 police, fearing large-scale clashes, separated the two groups. Authorities said there were no major incidents. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, police said they arrested nine neo-Nazi skinheads after about 150 battled police with bottles and stones following a soccer match late Friday. The skinheads shouted Nazi slogans during the match and later fought police in a street near the stadium. Police said they suspect the same group vandalized two subway stations after the match.

<HEAD>Former First Lady Reports On Life After Washington</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reported Saturday that life after the White House has its drawbacks. `` In the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, when you needed a plumber, you could always get one. In private life, you have to wait a little longer,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> observed, with a rueful smile. The former first lady, speaking publicly in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the first time since she and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> more than four months ago, offered a few insights into her old and new lives at a Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> forum on first ladies. Looking back, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the audience that although the position of first lady offers a tremendous platform, `` ironically, in some ways, a first lady loses her freedom of speech. `` There were things I longed to say over those eight years,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, evoking a laugh from the crowd. `` But I could n't. At times it was n't appropriate, and at other times it would have further complicated by husband's life.'' The former actress recalled that in her first stage role, she played a young woman that had been kidnapped and held in an attic, with only a chance to utter one line. `` There were times -LRB- in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- when I felt I was in the attic again,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` It was very frustrating.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is wrapping up her memoirs, which will be published by <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the fall. While in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the former first lady was also scheduled to appear at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Booksellers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to help tout her book. Entitled, `` My Turn,'' the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resident promised it would deal with the major controversies of her eight-year tenure, such as the renovation of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the new `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> red'' china, her use of astrology, her battles with chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> and her stormy relationship with Soviet first lady <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Asked if there were any scoops in the volume, she replied with a smile, `` The title says it all.'' The first lady said that while there is `` a certain dignity'' to holding silent, she has turned to writing a book for her own peace of mind, that of her children, and in order to help set the record straight. `` I felt I could start rebuilding a private life by writing about some things,'' she said. But when asked if she'd ever offer her original, personal diaries to be donated to her husband's presidential library, a horrified look crossed Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s face. `` I certainly hope not! I mean, there are some things'' to be kept private, she responded, as the crowd erupted in chuckles and applause.

 An Egyptian naval patrol shot and seriously wounded an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> man Saturday when he refused orders to stop his motorboat in Egyptian waters, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police said. Eyptian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials gave differing accounts of the incident. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for a `` clarification'' of the incident, which occurred in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> beach. An <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> official told the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> the boat violated Egyptian territory and that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> had protested to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The report said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials fired warning shots, but it did not mention any casualties. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Himo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yisraeli </PERSON>, 42, a resident of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION>, was fishing in his motor boat when an Egyptian patrol demanded he stop for identification. `` He continued to move,'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Himo </PERSON> said. `` The Egyptians shot a few warning shots in the air and he was struck by a bullet in the leg.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Yisraeli </PERSON> was on the boat with his two children and a guest. He refused to stop because he was in Egyptian waters and his guest did not have a passport, the radio reported. It said <PERSON> Yisraeli </PERSON> was shot in the leg and stomach and began losing large amounts of blood. He was treated on the spot by an Egyptian medic. The patrol then let the boat dock at <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Yisraeli </PERSON> was transfered to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> hospital, where he was in serious condition, the radio reported. The Egyptian <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> official said a patrol vessel was obliged to fire warning shots when an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> fishing boat came within 20 yards of the Egyptian coast and ignored a radio warning to clear the area. He said the Israeli boat fled toward <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION> after getting rid of some of its catch. The report gave no further details. Egyptian patrols have chased away several boatloads of Israelis who have tried in recent months to visit popular Egyptian fishing and diving waters without the necessary visas. The last major shooting incident between Egyptian troops and Israelis was in October 1985, when a paramilitary Egyptian police officer went berserk and killed seven Israeli tourists at the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Ras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Burka </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the 250-acre resort of <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, along with the rest of the Sinai desert, in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The area is adjacent to the Israeli town of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> returned <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in March after a bitter seven-year border dispute.

 A sailor who went absent without leave during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War 20 years ago is a `` dinosaur'' from a different era, and should not be court-martialed, his attorney argued. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who walked away from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> base and his wife and child in 1969, was tracked down by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> last month. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 40, is charged with desertion and using marijuana. The drug charge was added because <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> tested positive for marijuana when he surrendered May 4, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said. If court-martialed and convicted, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> faces up to seven years in prison. At a Friday hearing to determine whether <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> should be court-martialed or simply discharged, his attorney, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Nike </PERSON>, said, `` The man you see before you is sort of ... a dinosaur, someone from a different era.'' When <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> went AWOL from the base near here, he was 19, naive and angry that his wife had been unfaithful, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Nike </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> remarried, fathered five children and became a respected foreman at a paint company. `` Basically, we do n't have the same person today that we had then,'' De <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> said, arguing that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> should be granted the same discharge AWOL servicemen received under amnesty programs during the 1970s. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s prosecutor, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, argued that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s long absence without leave warranted strict punishment because it was `` aggravating.''

 Chinese troops stormed Tiananmen Square early Sunday, shooting and beating their way through crowds of pro-democracy protesters in clashes that witnesses and doctors said killed at least 32 people. Hundreds were wounded. The troops cut a violent swath through the heart of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to get to the the square, rolling through barricades and surging masses on the surrounding streets. By 3:30 a.m., soldiers and riot police had surrounded Tiananmen, boxing off several thousand students and supporters concentrated around a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center. A half hour later, lights were turned out. The square was in darkness. `` You have to give up all hope,'' students said over their loudspeaker at the monument. `` You have to give your life to the movement.'' Students sang the `` Internationale,'' the communist anthem. At 4:30 a.m., armored personnel carriers entered the square and troops began moving slowly toward several thousand students clustered around a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center. Sporadic gunfire could still be heard on the outskirts of the square as troops shot at crowds of thousands. The death and casualty toll was believed to be mounting rapidly. Ambulances and bicycle pedicabs went back and forth hauling away the wounded. One man was seen shot in the back, another in the head. An official loudspeaker on the square announced that the troops were moving in to clear the area as soldiers prepared to advance from all four sides. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Te-chien </PERSON>, a Taiwanese singer who defected to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1983 and has been active in the student movement, urged the students to leave. `` We're not afraid to die, but we've already lost too much blood,'' he said over a student loudspeaker. A 33-foot-high replica of the <ORGANIZATION> Statue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>, set up by students last week, remained standing. The main streets leading to the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s symbolic political center, were sealed. Thousands fled from the square, where hundreds of thousands of people had gathered to support students in the third week of a sit-in. The assault came two weeks after Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> declared martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and sent troops to the city. Hundreds of thousands of residents responded by blocking roads with trucks and their bodies. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Saturday the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had become `` ugly and chaotic. `` This will disturb the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government, and will disturb the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, considerably,'' he said. The secretary hinted that there could be repercussions to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's use of violence. The standoff between troops and protesters had been tense but largely peaceful for weeks, with soldiers seemingly reluctant or unable to move against the crowds until the first widespread violence broke out Saturday afternoon. A doctor from the <LOCATION> Fuxing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where troops began firing on street people, said the hospital had taken in 15 dead and so many wounded they had to be put in garages. A doctor from another hospital said 12 people died there. One soldier was killed when he was run over by an armored personnel carrier rushing toward the square, and another man was reported shot to death in a street clash elsewhere. A Swedish visitor, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansson </PERSON>, said he saw three people shot to death in clashes south of the square. `` The government is fascist! How can they do this to me? How can they do this to the people?'' cried a 28-year-old man who was shot in the leg. Most of those shot on the square were hurling rocks at the troops and people close to their front lines. A government loudspeaker on the square charged the students with `` counterrevolutionary turmoil'' and said the military was taking necessary means to end their rebellion. Sporadic clashes and dozens of injuries were reported on Saturday as soldiers made several attempts to reach the square. They retreated momentarily under barrages of rocks, shoes and other objects, then resumed their most violent push at about 8 p.m. Saturday, firing weapons and using tear gas and clubs as they moved toward <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. Thousands of troops armed with rifles marched up the east side of the square, beating people who got in their way. Students threw Molotov cocktails and other objects at them. One armored personnel carrier rammed into a burning bus on <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the main street running along the square, and was torched by students. Two people inside were dragged out by the crowds and beaten severely. Other armored personnel carriers drove up and down the avenue smashing down lane dividers and other barriers set up by citizens to block the army's way.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday he deeply deplored the decision by the government of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to use force `` against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of life.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, spending the weekend at his oceanside home before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after a week-long trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, issued a statement which condemned the Chinese tactics. `` It is clear that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government has chosen to use force against <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> citizens who were making a peaceful statement in favor of democracy. I deeply deplore the decision to use force against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of life,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had issued no formal reaction to the violence in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides had said the administration's comments would be made by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was also sharply critical of the Chinese action. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office later issued a statement in the president's own words `` We have been urging and continue to urge nonviolence, restraint and dialogue. Tragically, another course has been chosen. Again, I urge a return to non-violent means for dealing with the current situation.'' The president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had built a `` constructive relationship'' during the past 20 years through `` great efforts by both sides.'' The president added that the relationship had been beneficial to both nations. `` I hope that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will rapidly return to the path of political and economic reform and conditions of stability so that this relationship, so important to both our peoples can continue its growth.'' After returning from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> spent the day at their seaside estate with their daughter <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> and her children, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s deputy national security adviser and former deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, was at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s compound, providing updates of the developments in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. After an early morning jog, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent a quiet day with no public appearances. He had endured a night of fitful sleep because of jetlag. He arranged a private afternoon meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> to brief him on the European trip, but neither planned any remarks afterward. The <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat has criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as being too cautious and timid in dealing with initiatives from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but that was before the president won widespread praise for a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to reduce <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. European leaders hailed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as seizing the initiative from the Soviet leader. At a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting that concluded last Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also helped engineer a compromise to a dispute over <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> negotiations on short-range nuclear missiles. The agreement stipulates that no negotiations will be held until the signing of an agreement to reduce conventional forces and the reductions are already underway. Also planning to attend the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, and the state's governor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>. During his morning jog, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked whether he had heard from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` No phone calls yet,'' he replied. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from a week-long <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> trip, awoke at 3 a.m. EDT and finally got up a 4:45 a.m. Usually he arises between 6 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. His dog, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, accompanied him on the 20-minute run. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has been hit by its worst mosquito attack in 30 years, and the bugs were out in force during his run. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents and reporters who watched <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent much of their time swatting the bugs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not appear to be troubled by them. After breakfast, the president went fishing for several hours on his speedboat, `` Fidelity.'' He briefly climbed aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrol boat and put on a cap they gave him. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he also planned to play tennis during the day. The president will return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Sunday evening.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appealed Saturday for a return to the path of reform and nonviolence while the `` ugly and chaotic'' crackdown on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy demonstrators was called `` extremely deplorable'' by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued a late-afternoon statement from his oceanside home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, saying it was `` clear that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government has chosen to use force against <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> citizens who were making a peaceful statement in favor of democracy.'' `` I deeply deplore the decision to use force against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of life,'' the president said. `` We have been urging and continue to urge nonviolence, restraint and dialogue,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Tragically, another course has been chosen.

White House aides had said administration comment would come from <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> appeared on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Saturday'' and said that `` excessive force'' should not be used by the Chinese government. His appearance was interrupted by live telephone updates from reportrs on the scene observing violence in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. As the reporters relayed information that troops had opened fire on the demonstrators and that `` many people'' had been wounded, the secretary could hear the sound of ambulances echoing in the background. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, responding to the reports, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believed `` it would be unfortunate indeed if the army of the people were used to suppress the people.'' `` It's very important ... that excessive force not be used. That would unfortunately appear to be the case,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` This will disturb the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government, and will disturb the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, considerably. The secretary hinted that there could be repercussions to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's use of violence. `` It's important that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people not lose the social and economic progress, the developments they've made socially and economically, over the past decade,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be sharing military and scientific technology with a government that shoots its own people, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> responded: `` Let's see how this most recent and extremely deplorable development unfolds. Let's see what happens over the course of the next few days before we start hypothesizing about what we might or might not do in the future,'' he said. However, Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R.-N.C. </LOCATION>, said he would `` begin working with my colleagues to ensure that, as a first response against this brutality, all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military cooperation and sharing of technology with the Communist government of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> be terminated immediately.'' It was the first violence to mar the weeks-long pro-democracy demonstrations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who appeared on the television show at midday, said he had been in touch with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> during the previous hour. But the official said he could not confirm the reports of deaths in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. `` Unfortunately, the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is turning ugly and chaotic,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> noted that shooting has occurred in the square, and that the embassy had asked its personnel to leave the are. `` It is a situation that is not a happy one. ... It is indeed turning quite ugly,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The police contingent guarding the Chinese embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> appeared to be a little larger than usual Saturday afternoon, but there was no sign of activity outside. Chinese students studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had demonstrated outside the embassy last month in support of their colleagues in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The secretary said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has expressed its concern to the Chinese government that the utmost restraint be used.'' He took care to note that the Chinese have exercised `` a significant amount of restraint'' during the past month that the demonstrations have gone on. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added that there have also been reports that `` Molotov cocktails'' have been used in the most recent outbreak of violence, and he indicated that restraint also should be observed by the demonstrators. `` Both sides have exercised a significant degree of restraint. ... It is our hope that they will return to restraint,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The secretary observed that a `` power struggle'' was going on in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but refused to offer any administration evaluation of the events. `` I'd rather not go into any details of who's up and down,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He said that while the administration `` had some opinions'' on it, such comments would be interpreted as interfering in the internal affairs of another nation. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the administration could only wait and `` see how it develops.'' `` I do n't think we should sit here today, within hours of the first significant use of force ... against peaceful demonstrations ... and try to hypothesize about what that will mean,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` We will have to see what will happen ... let's see what happens now as we move forward. We're not sure what course this will take, even now,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says He Most Regrets Letting Bush Bash His State</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Saturday his greatest regret in losing the presidential race was allowing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to malign <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and swore to `` give the Republicans a dose of their own medicine.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stopped just short of apologizing to the 4,000 Democrats gathered for the state party's annual convention. Though he has been under attack since coming home in defeat to face a mounting budget deficit, many of the delegates said no apology was needed. `` Fiorello LaGuardia, the late, great mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, used to say, ` When I make a mistake, it's a beaut,' `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the crowd. `` And I made some beauts in the course of the campaign. `` But what I regret most of all is that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't only succeed in painting a distorted picture of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and what I stood for. He also managed to put you down in the process,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` He put down this great commonwealth and its people,'' he added. `` And I let him get away with it _ and I should n't have.'' During the presidential race, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' environmental record by drawing attention to the pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, and sought to discredit the economic `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Miracle.'' Delegates interrupted the speech repeatedly with applause. Some waved signs that read `` Proud of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> then lambasted the Republicans with caustic wit that supporters might have wished he'd inflicted on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` There's a party whose idea of public safety is <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>! ... A party whose environmental hero is <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> and whose program for cleaning up <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> was one boat ride last fall,'' he said. `` They'd probably make <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> secretary of labor,'' he added, earning a big laugh from labor delegates sporting hats and pins attacking the besieged <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> owner. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he will not run for re-election for governor next year, but has n't ruled out another bid for the presidency in 1992. He promised to keep <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democratic in 1990. `` Let's shake off the doubts and the disclaimers,'' he said. `` Let's give the Republicans a dose of their own medicine.'' Reaction to the speech was divided, with some saying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should have offered more than a tepid apology, and others maintaining an apology would only give `` Duke-bashing'' critics more ammunition. `` I think it was an important apology,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said the governor's decision to `` own up to the mistakes that have been made'' was the first step to restoring credibility. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> acknowledged mistakes in his campaign, he did not take responsiblity for the deficit that mushroomed while he was away on the campaign trail. `` I think it would have been better to acknowledge error on the financial situation as well,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was at the podium, however, some delegates were sizing up the floor, where three potential Democratic candidates for governor were trying to drum up support. `` I think the bashing's over,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, D-Andover. `` He's on his way out and people recognize that. The emphasis is on who's going to replace him.''

 Federal prosecutors declined to charge Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., with sexual assault because the young woman involved acknowledged that she pursued a meeting with him that night and did not leave after he made sexual advances, according to a newly released letter The prosecutors also cited a lack of physical evidence or corroborating testimony for her account. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office released a copy a Sept. 1, 1987 letter explaining the outcome to <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskir </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Kari </PERSON> <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON>. The letter was signed by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roistacher </PERSON>, executive assistant to then-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGenova </PERSON>. A former legislative aide and the daughter of longtime <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> family friends, Ms. <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON>, now 27, said in September of last year that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, now 62, had drugged and fondled her March 27, 1987 in his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, home while his wife was away. Ms. <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON> said she had accepted an invitation to go to a restaurant with <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> after determining to tell the senator to stop propositioning her. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has denied all her allegations but said he made a mistake letting her spend the night at his house. <PERSON> Roistacher </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Baskir </PERSON>: `` She told the police that she has known Senator <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> for many years as a family friend. She said that Senator <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> made sexual overtures toward her for several weeks, if not longer. Nevertheless, she arranged to have dinner alone with him. When he did not appear, she drove alone to his house, arriving after dark. `` There she had several drinks, and by her account, remained in his house and had another drink even after his conversation became explicitly sexual. She went to the bathroom and recalls wondering whether ... -LRB- name deleted by the government to protect privacy of third party -RRB- would learn that she had been there. She recalls little else, except that she awoke the following morning to find that someone had removed her clothing ... Senator <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, she said, was lying by her side, fondling her.'' <PERSON> Roistacher </PERSON> added that she did not report the incident to police for three days, declined to identify her assailant until June and gave differing statements to police. Of the drugging allegation, <PERSON> Roistacher </PERSON> said, `` No objective evidence supports your supposition about the drugging except Ms. <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON>'s symptoms the morning after, which seem equally consistent with excess consumption of alcohol over the course of an evening.'' A hospital test the day after showed no evidence of drugging. Although <PERSON> Baskir </PERSON> had claimed her account was corroborated, <PERSON> Roistacher </PERSON> replied, `` This ` abundant' evidence does not consist of eyewitness testimony about the crime, nor of physical, scientific or medical evidence, but the subsequent repetition of her story to close friends and relatives.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday he deeply deplored the military crackdown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that resulted in the deaths of peaceful demonstrators and he urged <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s government to return to non-violent tactics in dealing with pro-democracy protestors `` We have been urging and continue to urge non-violence, restraint,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Tragically another course has been chosen.'' `` Again, I urge a return to non-violent means for dealing with the current situation,'' the president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his remarks in a written statement issued from his vacation home here. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who arrived here Friday from a week-long <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> trip, did not make any public appearance but was kept abreast of developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, his deputy national security adviser. He also consulted by telephone with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It is clear that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government has chosen to use force against <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> citizens who were making a peaceful statement in favor of democracy. I deeply deplore the decision to use force against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of life,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had built a `` constructive relationship'' during the past 20 years through `` great efforts by both sides.'' The president added that the relationship had been beneficial to both nations. `` I hope that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will rapidly return to the path of political and economic reform and conditions of stability so that this relationship, so important to both our peoples can continue its growth.'' After returning from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> spent the day at their seaside estate with their daughter <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> and her children, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellie </PERSON>. After an early morning jog, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent a quiet day with no public appearances. He had endured a night of fitful sleep because of jetlag. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met at his seaside home with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>. They were accompainied by <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> and his wife, Rep. <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>. Stopping by a cluster of reporters at a checkpoint near <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s compound, the two senators praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, saying they supported him Asked if there was anything more the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could do, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said `` I think ` deplore' and coming from the president is pretty strong language.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, `` I do believe that there can be no justification for the actions by the Chinese government and the use of force against its own citizens peacefully demonstrating for the most basic freedoms and I support _ I strongly support _ the president's deploring of that violence. `` We ought to make it very clear the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government stands with, and in support of, those who seek freedom and democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and throughout the world,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who had criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in recent weeks for moving too slowly in responding to initiatives from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, also praised the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal to cut American and Soviet combat troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Asked if he regretted his earlier criticism, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said there was nothing to regret. `` We're pleased he took our advice and is now moving fast,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. European leaders hailed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as seizing the initiative from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. At a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting that concluded last Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also helped engineer a compromise to a dispute over <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> negotiations on short-range nuclear missiles. The agreement stipulates that no negotiations will be held until the signing of an agreement to reduce conventional forces and the reductions are already underway. During his morning jog, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked whether he had heard from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` No phone calls yet,'' he replied. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from a week-long <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> trip, awoke at 3 a.m. EDT and finally got up a 4:45 a.m. Usually he arises between 6 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. His dog, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, accompanied him on the 20-minute run. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has been hit by its worst mosquito attack in 30 years, and the bugs were out in force during his run. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents and reporters who watched <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent much of their time swatting the bugs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not appear to be troubled by them. After breakfast, the president went fishing for several hours on his speedboat, `` Fidelity.''

<HEAD>Jurors Must Decide What Congressman Knew About Money Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For jurors in the two-week-old perjury trial of former Republican Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a familiar question is taking shape: What did he know, and when did he know it? At issue is what <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> knew about money broker `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'' _ actually undercover <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> _ and where <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> claimed he got his money. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> negotiated with the agent for $ 850,000 for home construction over one month in 1987. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is accused in the 10-count indictment of lying to a federal grand jury in February 1988. Under the cloud of the indictment, he lost his bid for a third term to Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, onetime star of the `` Dukes of Hazzard'' television show, last November in a district in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s suburbs. If convicted, he faces 10 months to five years in prison on each count. The jury in the case has heard audio tapes and seen videotapes in which <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, at various times, acknowledged that drugs were the likely source of the money `` Martinez'' had. In those conversations, <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> that the deal involved `` washing'' of cash, and the congressman proposed receiving the money through a mortgage company created for the purpose by <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> associate <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> emigre who has since been convicted of money laundering. The tapes are the backbone of the government's case, as prosecutors try to prove that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> lied when he testified he did not recall discussing the illegal nature of the money handling and that he did n't recall being told the money was narcotics money, among other allegations. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s lead attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, says he will prove that <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> was `` psychotic liar'' who deceived <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> into thinking the deal for $ 850,000 from <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> was all right, while deceiving the agent into thinking <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was a crook. In cross-examination over three days last week, <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> hammered at <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> over statements the agent himself made in the tapes. <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> told <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> at one point the money was `` flight capital,'' then said at another point that it was not and `` could be anything.'' Flight capital is money sent out of troubled areas by wealthy people seeking to invest or store it in a stable country like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And more than two dozen times, <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> forced <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> to concede that he did not know what kind of tale LeChasney was telling <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>, the government's first witness in the case, was on the stand more than six days, going one-by-one over tapes of 16 conversations he had with LeChasney about the <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> deal, plus five with the congressman himself and two meetings with both men. Tapes the jury saw or heard include one of a meeting between the three on Sept. 13, 1987, at a posh <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> resort, `` Martinez'' told <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> `` clearly, I violate some currency laws,'' and `` my gut feeling is there has to be narcotics dollars in there. ... It is not flight capital.'' `` Anything you tell me is told in total confidence,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> replied. Later, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said, `` I am basically using <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> as my buffer. ... What I have to say is, I borrowed money from <LOCATION> Gulfstates </LOCATION>,'' LeChasney's company. On Sept. 23, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> indicated he knew LeChasney would handle the cash in circumvention of bank reporting laws. `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> is going to ensure that basically the money is funneled in a way so that there are no reports filed,'' <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> said. `` Yeah. I'm protected that way,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> replied. Finally, as the deal collapsed on Sept. 26, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> told the agent he would `` acknowledge'' an `` assignment'' of assets through LeChasney to <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, but he could not accept the cash directly, because `` I would then be laundering y' all's money. But <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, in cross-examination, repeatedly asked <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> why he had misled the congressman when he told him flatly the money `` is flight capital.'' `` As opposed to being laundered out of some drug scheme,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said. `` I would assume so,'' the agent replied. <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> testified that he was portraying a drug-money launderer, and such a person would fudge details of the deal when talking on the telephone.

 Thousands of smiling, flag-waving Poles gathered at their nation's consulates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Saturday to vote in the freest elections behind the Iron Curtain in 42 years. `` For the first time, we're voting with pleasure,'' <PERSON> Ada </PERSON> <PERSON> Cichy </PERSON> said as she stood in the entry hall of the consulate here. Polish diplomatic and contract workers and immigrants who remain Polish citizens also flocked to consulates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to vote a day in advance of Sunday's elections in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The elections are the result of an agreement between the communist government and the Solidarity trade union, in which Solidarity was given legal status after a seven-year ban. Ballots from about 600,000 Poles abroad will be counted in a single district in the middle of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, which has only 140,000 eligible voters. `` Ninety percent of the people are going to vote for Solidarity,'' <PERSON> Cichy </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The party does n't stand a chance.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> results are not expected to be known until Sunday morning at the earliest. Hundreds of people here greeted each other in Polish on Saturday as they waited in long lines under gray skies and frequent heavy rains. A nearby bus shelter was plastered with posters for Solidarity candidates. `` These are our history's first really democratic elections,'' said Vice Consul <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michniewicz </PERSON>. `` The voters are excited and really happy. I've seen a lot of smiles on their faces.'' About 4,000 people had turned out by early evening, a sharp contrast to previous elections that typically drew only about 200 people, <PERSON> Michniewicz </PERSON> said. Balloting was slowed by the small number of poll workers and a shortage of voting booths. Crowds of people sat in stairways and around coffee tables to mark paper ballots. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, hundreds of people crowded into the ornate consulate on Madison Avenue in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` This is pure satisfaction,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Piotrowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Butler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> who emigrated from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> six years ago. `` If it was the old kind of voting, I would n't be here.'' By early evening, 5,000 people had voted, said <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorajewski </PERSON>, an official poll watcher there. Busloads of people arrived from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and hundreds came by subway. A group of about 50 from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> marched up a Madison Avenue with a Solidarity flag. `` It is amazing _ a Polish miracle,'' said <PERSON> Tomasz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalewski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, an official poll watcher for Solidarity. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where few Poles live, about 175 people had turned up by noon, said an embassy official who declined to give his name. Not everybody supported the balloting. Outside the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> consulate, <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Losiak </PERSON> handed out pamphlets urging a boycott. `` These are not truly democratic elections,'' <PERSON> Losiak </PERSON> said. `` For the first time, the Communist government is going to have a moral legitimacy in the eyes of the people. We only want 100 percent free elections.'' Under the pact between the opposition and the government, 65 percent of the seats in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 460-member lower house, or Sejm, are reserved for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies. Balloting for the new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is wide open. Others in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged fellow Poles to vote. <PERSON> Wojtek </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawa </PERSON>, the host of a Polish-language radio program in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, handed out lists of the names of Solidarity-backed candidates. <PERSON> Sawa </PERSON> called a boycott `` ridiculous.'' `` For the first time in 45 years, the people have a chance to gain some ground,'' he said. `` By not taking advantage of that, we would n't gain anything.''

 `` Ed's Party,'' planned as a step toward getting on with life, brought some unwelcome notoriety Saturday to the town where <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 crashed. `` Let's party!'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaus </PERSON>, 14, of <LOCATION> Sicklerville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, for whom the event was named. To some relatives of the 270 people killed by the terrorist bomb that felled the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 on Dec. 21, a party seemed inappropriate, especially because of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> called it `` a bizarre attempt to make up for the airliner disaster,'' leaving the town's leaders defensive Saturday. `` Given the circumstances of this town, the party is unusual, but it is being supported by the vast majority of the local people, not to cause distress or anguish but to prove to themselves and the world that whereas we mourn those who died, they are determined to repair their town, rebuild shattered lives and ensure a special and sacred place in their hearts for 270 people from 24 nations,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, chairman the local Community Support agency. Response was enthusiastic, with families and groups of children heading toward the football ground as early as 9 a.m. for a day of hamburgers, hot dogs, bagpipes and rock bands in the sun. All wore red `` Ed's Party'' badges to distinguish townspeople from reporters. `` This is their town and their party,'' <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> told a news conference. Pan Am was not represented. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaus </PERSON> said he had written asking the airline to send Christmas presents to the children of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. The first he heard of a party, he said, was when <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> invited him, his parents and three brothers. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Kungu </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> pharmacist and regional councilor, said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> raised the idea of a summer Christmas, but townspeople suggested the party instead. `` The idea is not <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s. It is from the community,'' <PERSON> Kungu </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 103 group, was quoted by The <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> <PERSON> Standard </PERSON> as saying, `` It is good for them to have a party, but <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement is despicable We see this purely as a public relations exercise on their part.'' About 20 relatives and friends of victims gathered outside <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters Saturday to protest the airline's role in the party. `` I'm outraged,'' said a tearful <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissett </PERSON>, whose 21-year-old son, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON>, was killed in the bombing. `` How can they do something like that _ picnic where bodies were found?'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jervis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said: `` We feel <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> should be putting its money into security, not parties.'' Scottish police say they believe the plane was blown apart by a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player in the hold. Complaints from relatives led the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to cancel plans to send <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> to the party, and the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> company decided against supplying hot dogs. `` The party does n't mean that we are going to forget what happened on Dec. 21, but everyone must remember that -LRB- it -RRB- is primarily for the children,'' said <PERSON> Elma </PERSON> <PERSON> Brockbank </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. `` There is a feeling that perhaps the Americans have n't thought enough about our children _ after all, they were looking forward to meeting <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>,'' she said. <PERSON> Kungu </PERSON> said children between 8 and 14 were affected most by the tragedy, especially in the <LOCATION> Rosebank </LOCATION> neighborhood where the plane's engines jammed into the ground `` Bodies were scattered all over the place. Children have seen that,'' he said. Among special guests was <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> football coach <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, invited because several <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students died in the bombing. `` Why am I here? People are telling me that we can help,'' said <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, who brought helmets and other American football equipment to show the children. `` If they ask you to do something, if you do n't you're damned, and if you do perhaps you're damned as well,'' he said. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicol </PERSON>, who brought his two children, said the party was `` a day for the children to remember and a day when everyone has got together on a happy occasion, when we can begin to put the past behind us.''

<HEAD>Swiss Socialists: No Farewell to Arms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Swiss <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> decided Saturday not to back a movement to dismantle the country's army, averting a crisis for the 30-year coalition government. After intense debate at a Socialist congress in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, delegates voted 583 to 370 against taking any stand on a Nov. 26 national referendum on the proposal to disband <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s 625,000-member army. <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubacher </PERSON> had called the proposal `` a rotten egg'' and urged the party to take a clear stand against it. The proposal has drawn a fierce reaction from the Socialists' three center-right partners in a governing alliance which is cited as a prime factor in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s political stability A leader of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Blocher </PERSON>, had said an anti-army decision by the Socialists should spell the end of the government coalition. After the vote, however, <PERSON> Blocher </PERSON> said the Socialists should remain in the alliance. The strongest reaction to the vote came from the Free Radical Democrats, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s largest party, which called for talks between the four parties on the Socialists' role in the government. Its official statement said the vote called into question the Socialists' commitment to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s `` armed neutrality.'' The third partner, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, also criticized the Socialists. They said the Socialists had lost credibility in deciding to take no stand. Saturday's special congress revealed deep divisions among the Socialists themselves. Right-wing members and trade union leaders oppose the disarmament plan, while young party members are particularly important in a pacifist groundswell. Even though delegates at the congress in the Swiss capital decided by a majority of 213 against making a recommendation on referendum, a surprising majority of 641 to 259 said they personally backed the no-army proposal. The anti-army proposal was put forward by socialists and religious pacifists who collected 113,000 signatures, forcing the referendum. The proposed amendment to the federal constitution says `` <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> has no army'' and deletes all references to defense needs. Recent public opinion polls suggest that about one in four Swiss voters might sympathize with the `` zero option.'' Protests have grown against low-flying combat planes and noise from militia target practice at the country's shooting ranges. But most Swiss seem to oppose a farewell to arms in this country where the military has a long tradition, even though the army has not fought a foreign war for five centuries.

<TEXT>
 A car believed to have plunged into the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> when a temporary bridge collapsed was pulled from the river Saturday with a body inside. The body was the second found in the river since the May 26 collapse of the one-lane, temporary <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 52 bridge. The body of <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorn </PERSON>, 52, of the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, was found floating in debris Tuesday about five miles downriver from the bridge. <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities said this week that Mrs. <PERSON> Zorn </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Siemon </PERSON>, 27, was believed to have been with Mrs. <PERSON> Zorn </PERSON> when the bridge collapsed Sheriff's officers, however, could not immediately confirm that the body recovered Saturday was that of Ms. <PERSON> Siemon </PERSON>, even though the car was identified as the one occupied by the mother and daughter, said sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weikel </PERSON>. The body was taken to the <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's office in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> for identification, <PERSON> Weikel </PERSON> said. Professional divers working with a crane operator about 75 yards down river from the collapsed bridge located the submerged car. The crane then dragged it out of the water. Later in the day, heavy rain began falling on the site 12 miles west of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, and the search for more victims was called off for several days until the river level drops back down, <PERSON> Weikel </PERSON> said. Strong underwater currents during the past week have frustrated recovery efforts, which prompted Sheriff <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Leis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to hire divers who have experience in underwater investigation at accident sites. Searchers using a sonar imaging device have been unable to find a second vehicle, either a van or pickup truck, that two witnesses reported seeing fall from the bridge. `` There are no missing-person reports that came in on the van that supposedly went down, so we're beginning to think there was no van,'' <PERSON> Weikel </PERSON> said.

 The big guns in electronic fun tried to stake claims on young hearts Saturday, displaying such gadgets as portable, hand-held video games and a microphone that lets you sound like <PERSON> Darth </PERSON> <PERSON> Vader </PERSON> or <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>. The collection of goodies was at the four-day Consumer Electronics Show, which runs here through Tuesday. The toys are n't just for kids. A number of electronics manufacturers are marketing telephones that look like bowling pins, hamburgers and fish _ with your choice of large-mouth bass, chinook salmon or walleye pike. For car buffs, <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> representatives are showing systems that project a map on the windshield to keep drivers eyes on the road. They also display camera-relayed rear and side vision on a screen in the dashboard. `` You can even see videotapes, like one that shows you how to change a tire,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffis </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION>. A microphone changes voice patterns to any of 16 octaves _ making it easy to mimic film characters including the deep-voiced <PERSON> Darth </PERSON> <PERSON> Vader </PERSON> or a squeaky <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>. The device was developed by <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, creators of Etch A Sketch, and should be in retail stores by the Christmas season with a $ 48 price tag. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON>, president of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> ESP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, hopes to cash in on what he calls the `` world's first computer sport.'' The game, called Battletech Center, is a mix of Disney-like environmental fantasy and flight simulator technology, he said. Players sit in four cockpits, and must act as a team in a strategic video game simulating ground or air battles. `` The desire to be <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> in Top Gun or <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Skywalker </PERSON> in Star Wars, to not have to live that experience vicariously, I think that's a very common fantasy,'' <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> said. `` I wanted to create something that kids think about and use some strategy instead of just their trigger finger.'' It took him eight years to develop the game, and he is negotiating for lease space to open a Battletech Center in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> by the end of the year. Players would pay $ 6 for a half-hour game. `` It got us hooked in two minutes,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayley </PERSON> as he stepped out of the cockpit along with colleague <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleckert </PERSON>. The two show attendees from a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION> Gusdorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, predicted the game would `` definitely catch on.'' Only retailers, buyers, manufacturers and media representatives are allowed in the annual show at <ORGANIZATION> McCormick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Place </ORGANIZATION>. Among the new items offered by video game giants <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> are hand-held games that, unlike their predecessors, have more advanced television-like screens. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s Game Boy, which has liquid crystal display, will retail for Christmas at $ 89.95. The <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advantage </ORGANIZATION>, which has a color screen, will sell for $ 140. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> is also offering new for 1989 a Soviet-developed game called Tetris, which asks a player to build a horizontal line with a series of uneven lines and shapes. The company is spending about $ 4 million to market the game to an older crowd, `` from 2 to 92,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> advertising manager.

 Combining pep rally spirit and a serious message, a global telecast aimed at more than 1 billion people brought celebrities and world leaders together Saturday to push for a new age of environmental consciousness. Called `` Our Common Future,'' the five-hour telecast originated from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and picked up satellite feeds from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and elsewhere. Organizers said it was beamed to 100 countries, making it potentially available to 90 percent of the world's television sets. Norwegian Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> was host of the collage of music and messages calling for the world to adopt `` sustainable development,'' to reach a happy medium between improving living standards and protecting resources and the environment for the future. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> chaired a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> commission that developed a report, also called `` Our Common Future,'' on the same topic. `` We need more people to be aware,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> said as she opened the broadcast. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, rock musician <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> as he urged viewers to adopt the program's message. `` Everything has changed but the way we think,'' <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON> said. `` The first thing we have to change is the way we think.'' Organizers say the spectacle was not a fund-raiser but a consciousness-raiser, designed to take advantage of growing concern over ozone depletion, global warming, tropical rain forest destruction and other issues. `` It's a kind of wake-up call,'' said singer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denver </PERSON>, one of the participants. Among the other musicians to perform were <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, Sting, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Uplinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Verna </PERSON>, who produced and directed the Live Aid benefit for African relief in 1985, teamed up again for the telecast. The Swiss-based Centre for Our Common Future and Washington-based Uplinger Enterprises put it together. `` To hold this kind of event lays the foundation of public awareness,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindner </PERSON>, executive director of the center. `` You know and I know that political change comes not in and of itself but is greatly facilitated by an informed and motivated public.'' The budget was just under $ 2 million, which is being covered by corporate sponsors, <PERSON> Lindner </PERSON> said. All the entertainers donated their talents, as did many other professionals and technicians involved. Setting up the satellite links and other organizational tasks were similar to the Live Aid program, which was held in two outdoor sports stadiums in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, he said. The difference is in the participants. Live Aid was virtually all music and had Irish rock musician <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON> as its host. `` It's been a very, very difficult situation,'' <PERSON> Uplinger </PERSON> said. `` You have heads of state involved. You ca n't do the same things with Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> as you can do with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> chaired a U.N.-appointed commission that spent three years gathering testimony and information to compile a report on the world's environment and development. The report was also called `` Our Common Future.'' She received the 1988 Third World Prize from the London-based Third World Foundation for her work of the commission.

<TEXT>
 Retiring Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said Saturday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health care system is unfair to millions of Americans, and he called for the appointment of a presidential commission to draft a plan for change. In a commencement address to 2,200 graduates of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> catalogued the ills of the medical delivery and insurance system, laying particular emphasis on inequities. `` Our current system of health care is not fair, it's not just, and it's not the morally strong system this country deserves,'' he said. The 72-year-old <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, who is retiring this year after eight years as surgeon general, cited estimates that 37 million Americans _ about 15 percent of the population _ have no health insurance, while millions of others have only partial coverage. He said health care costs have been rising at two to three times the rate of inflation as a whole, and public expectations of medical care are `` fast outracing our ability to pay for them.'' The former pediatric surgeon also was critical of both doctors and hospitals, saying he did not foresee `` the medical profession achieving any success in self-regulation.'' He noted that many hospitals have tried to cut the number of indigent patients they treat. `` I say there's something terribly wrong with a system of health care that spends more and more money to serve fewer and fewer people,'' he said. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> provided no specific recommendations for reform, however, beyond suggesting the appointment of a presidential commission. He did not call for national health insurance, even though he was introduced by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., a strong supporter of that concept He also steered clear of the term socialized medicine, saying he favored a `` laissez-faire marketplace and a competitive economy.'' One of the problems of the current health care system, he said, is that it is `` distinguished by a lack of competition in price, quality or service.'' `` We need a presidential commission, the bluest of blue-ribbon panels, to consider the future of health care in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> suggested that the panel include health care professionals, insurance industry representatives and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. While the creation of a more equitable health care system will be `` a major task for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said, it is something `` we need to prove to ourselves and the world'' if the nation is to retain its moral strength.

 More than 4,000 anti-nuclear activists Saturday staged the biggest rally against the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant in 11 years, a prelude to a civil disobedience protest planned for Sunday. Traffic lined a highway that runs by the seaside plant, and many of the cars sported anti-Seabrook signs. At <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, less than two miles from the plant, protesters heard speakers denounce <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> and promise to continue fighting to prevent it from operating commercially. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> opponent <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Comley </PERSON> drew cheers when he told the gathering he had hired planes pulling anti-nuclear banners to fly over the beach Saturday and about 40 miles up the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> coast to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, on Sunday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was spending the weekend there. `` The nuclear industry and some of the people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> believe this fight is over,'' <PERSON> Comley </PERSON> said. `` I'll tell you, we're just starting. The anti-nuclear <ORGANIZATION> Clamshell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> is organizing the protests, which it hopes will be the biggest since May 1977, when 1,414 people were arrested at the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> site. About 2,500 arrests have been made in protests at the plant since construction began in 1976. Saturday's rally had the largest turnout since a 1978 protest that drew an estimated 18,000 people. Officials in neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> also have sought to block the plant by refusing to cooperate with emergency evacuation planning. Despite the opposition, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> won its low-power testing license from federal regulators on May 26, nearly three years after the $ 6 billion reactor was completed. Plant officials have begun preparing for the first atomic chain reaction by Tuesday or Wednesday, plant spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, who stopped by the rally, said the protesters represented a `` vocal minority.'' `` But the majority of people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the rest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> recognize that nuclear power is a viable energy alternative and <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> ... is ready to produce electricity and it can make an important contribution,'' <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. The plant first must win federal approval for evacuation plans for crowded summer beaches and communities up to 10 miles away. `` The truth is you can not evacuate <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and the other beaches and protect the people,'' attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Backus </PERSON>, who has represented anti-Seabrook groups since 1972, told the crowd. `` The truth is we do n't know what to do with nuclear waste,'' <PERSON> Backus </PERSON> said. `` The truth is that the plant is uneconomic.'' Before the weekend, at least 300 to 500 people went through training sessions on non-violent civil disobedience, <PERSON> Clamshell </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> said. The sessions continued Saturday. On Sunday, some activists planned to climb fences surrounding the 715-acre plant site and others planned to sit down outside gates. Some protesters also planned to go to a railroad siding at the plant to re-create an August 1976 protest in which 18 people were arrested _ the first group civil disobedience against a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear power plant. Earlier in the week, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> let the town charge the organizers a $ 300 fee and $ 3,600 bond for an assembly permit. Clamshell members said they could n't and would n't pay Since a town ordinance bars gatherings of more than 25 people without a permit, the activists said they planned to march to the plant on Sunday in groups of fewer than 20.

 Tens of thousands of Israelis, some carrying signs saying `` Thou shalt not kill!'' on Saturday protested attacks by Jewish settlers on Arab communities in the occupied territories. Also Saturday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops wounded 13 Palestinians in clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s Kings of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, about 30,000 supporters of a leftist peace coalition held the protest rally against violence by Jewish settlers. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said rally organizers were distributing petitions, already signed by 32 of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s 120 members, calling on police and the army to arrest settler vigilantes. `` If <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> does not get up and stop them now, maybe some day not far from now, they -LRB- the settlers -RRB- will arrest us,'' said Israeli author <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Oz </PERSON>. The Israeli news media said Saturday the army is considering restricting the movement of settlers suspected of involvement in vigilante acts against Palestinians. About 70,000 Jews live in 131 settlements in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> that have an Arab population of 1.7 million. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded eight Palestinians, including an 11-year-old boy who was hit in the leg, Arab hospital officials reported. They said that in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> troopers shot and wounded five Palestinians and one of the victims was a 7-year-old boy. The army announced an indefinite curfew on <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> beginning Sunday morning, restricting the seaside strip's 700,000 residents to their homes. Palestinian militants launched an uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation in December 1987 and since then at least 504 Arabs have been killed in the violence. Twenty-two Israelis have been killed.

 Many Americans think the current focus on ethics is paralyzing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, but about half said Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was treated fairly by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, according to a poll released Saturday. Fifty-four percent of the people interviewed said the attention to ethics was preventing the government from focusing on the budget deficit, education, crime, drugs and the homeless, according to the poll, which will be published in this week's Newsweek magazine. But 41 percent said it was necessary to restore integrity and confidence in government. On the controversial issue of congressional pay raises, 56 percent of Americans oppose any pay increase, the poll found. Fifteen percent said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should get a raise and 26 percent said members should get a raise only if they give up speaking fees, the poll said. Asked to describe <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' greatest problem, 53 percent said members were not dealing with the nation's real problems; 20 percent said they were too tied to special interests through campaign contributions; and 18 percent pointed to the sexual misconduct, excessive drinking and unethical financial dealings of members. Forty-nine percent said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gave fair treatment to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who announced his resignation last week after being cited for ethics violations. Twenty-eight percent said he was n't treated fairly and 23 percent said they did not know, according to the poll. Although 53 percent of the people surveyed said most or many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> take unethical advantage of their positions to make outside income, 47 percent said their own representatives take no such an advantage. Thirty-one percent said they did and 22 percent did not know. The poll, conducted for <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, interviewed 750 adults by telephone Thursday and Friday.

 Leftist rebels on Saturday spurned the new rightist president's proposal for dialogue, dismissing it as a call to capitulate. The rejection came in a communique from the rebels' <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> broadcast on local radio stations. There was no immediate reaction from the government. Despite their rejection of the offer to talk, the guerrillas also said Saturday that they lifted a ban on road travel called to protest the inauguration Thursday of the President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> on Friday called for more regional efforts to end <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s civil war. He said bringing peace to this country was just as important as dismantling the U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels. He has pledged not to negotiate changes in the political system with the rebels but has offered talks instead on integrating them into civilian life. In their statement, the rebels said they stood ready to negotiate a political solution to their nine-year war against the U.S.-backed government. But they said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s proposal did not offer them a chance to do so and that it was an `` invitation to surrender.'' The rebel communique instead invited <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s political parties to sponsor a peace dialogue. The rebels said the new president had been trying to project `` an image acceptable to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the European community, but the content of his speech was predominantly confrontation, strictly faithful to the politics and economics of Arena.'' Arena is <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. The party takes a hard line on the war, and many observers expect the fighting to intensify under the Arena government. About 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have already died in the civil war. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> assumed power from President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> is suffering from cancer and has left the country for more chemotherapy. The rebels' traffic ban had paralyzed nationwide traffic since Wednesday. `` All highways are reopened to the free circulation of vehicles,'' said the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION> in Saturday's broadcast It said the rebels also ordered all guerrilla units `` to suspend any further action'' against motorists. Guerrillas damaged or destroyed five vehicles and dynamited power transformers and electrical transmission towers, but no injuries were reported. The country's 245 gas stations were also forced to remain closed for fear of rebel reprisals. Speaking at his news conference Friday, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> reiterated accusations made by <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ruling leftist Sandinista regime was helping the Salvadoran guerrillas. The Sandinistas have often denied such charges, claiming they provide only moral support. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> praised a Central American initiative aimed at negotiating peaceful solutions to conflicts in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The accords call for demobilizing the Nicaraguan rebels, who now live in border camps in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> broke Sunday over a battle-scarred Tiananmen Square with tanks and rifle-toting troops ruling the vast expanse occupied the day before by students seeking a freer society from their communist rulers. A low cloud of smoke covered much of the 100-acre square as bonfires set during the night's confrontation continued to smolder. Hundreds of helmeted troops were deployed on the monument to revolutionary heroes in the square's center and thousands more at important intersections nearby. Tanks moved into place on what had hours earlier been a rag-tag squatter's camp of tents for the pro-democracy students. The battle for <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> was primarily fought in the streets leading to the square, where scores of people fell trying to prevent columns of troops and armored military vehicles from moving on the students. Gunfire could be heard from several sides, and tracers zipped through the sky above <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s mausoleum, one of the main monuments to Chinese communism in the square. Torched buses and army vehicles on the streets around <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> billowed acrid smoke. Troops first entered the square from the south, when a column trotted toward the student encampment about 1 a.m. -LRB- noon EDT Saturday -RRB-. They took up positions to the east after a brief skirmish involving clubs and sticks with students. More soldiers were deployed in front of the Great Hall of the People to the west, and a huge convoy with armored vehicles rolled down <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> to the north side. The few thousand students remaining in the square stayed calm as they quietly gathered on the steps of the heroes' monument. `` I'm not afraid,'' several said as the heavily armed troops encircled Hundreds of supporters continued to mill around the square, many dressed more for a summer outing than a military battle. Loudspeakers blaring government and student announcements engaged in a noisy propaganda battle throughout the night. `` The government is corrupt, you've been tricked,'' the students roared. The state-run speaker warned that troops would use every means at their disposal to clear the square and that remaining students would bear responsibility for the consequences. At 4 a.m., the lamposts that dot the square went ominously dark, and the student loudspeaker played the <LOCATION> Internationale </LOCATION>, the socialist anthem. A <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> singer staging a hunger strike for democracy took the microphone and proclaimed: `` We've achieved a big victory. ... We're not afraid to die, but we've already lost too much blood.'' After the lights went back on a half hour later, a voice vote by the students showed most wanted to leave the square to avoid further bloodshed. They quickly filed out under the banners of their schools, carrying the quilts and padded jackets that offered warmth during the 22-day sit-in. Neither the students nor the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents who arrived to show support could control their tears. `` Go with us,'' they told their supporters, who applauded the students as they retreated. As they sobbed, many students defiantly shouted: `` We shall return!'' and flashed V-for-victory signs.

 Socialists pelted the daughter of a conservative leader with garbage and rabbit skins as she arrived for her wedding, setting off gun battles that injured at least 29 people, officials said Saturday. The wedding was attended by Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> and Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Guido </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON>, both of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. They were not injured. The clashes occurred Friday night in the village of <LOCATION> Zejtun </LOCATION>, a Socialist stronghold seven miles from <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION> on this Mediterranean island off <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdilla </PERSON>, daughter of the local <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> president, arrived at the church in a two-horse open carriage, <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> backers threw garbage and rabbit skins at her. She rushed into the church, protected by police, while the onlookers insulted her and her father, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdilla </PERSON>. Police called in reinforcements when the prime minister and deputy prime minister arrived. At one point, the crowd tried to surge into the church, and police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of Socialists who had massed by then. Gun battles broke out between police and people in the crowd. Some of them shouted anti-government slogans. Officials said 26 police officers were injured, 10 by gunfire. Three other people were injured. The crowd gathered after a newspaper reported that the prime minister would be acting as a witness at the wedding. Although his party has preached reconciliation since defeating the Socialists in general elections two years ago, <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> remains politically polarized. Since the election, <PERSON> Zejtun </PERSON> has earned the nickname `` the Republic of Zejtun'' for forbidding the Nationalists from holding a meeting in the village. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> told a news conference that arrests had been made. He gave no number. Despite the clashes, the wedding went on as planned.

 Explosions leveled three buildings at a gunpowder plant Saturday, injuring at least 18 people, blowing out windows in nearby towns and shaking houses up to 13 miles away. The 5 a.m. explosions at the <ORGANIZATION> Hercules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Powder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plant knocked down trees, tore off doors and damaged many homes and about 80 percent of the businesses in this north-central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> township, about 40 miles west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, officials said. The plant makes gunpowder for military and commercial uses. `` There's absolutely nothing there but dirt and it does n't even look that there was a building there,'' said <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzucca </PERSON>, a witness who flew over the site in a helicopter several hours after the blast. `` All of the trees are blown over on the sides. It looks like <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION>. Helens.'' Three of about 40 buildings at the 6-square-mile complex were destroyed, four others had fire damage and several others were partly damaged, plant manager <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said. He said he did not know the cause of the blast. `` It was a chain reaction,'' he said. `` I do n't know how and why.'' About 30,000 <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Light customers in a 10-mile radius of the blast site lost power for two minutes after the blast, said <PERSON> Eunice </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON>, a company spokesman. <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappa </PERSON> said he was working inside the finishing area of the plant when he heard an explosion. `` All I know is that the lights flickered on and off throughout the whole building and in about 15 seconds there was the first explosion,'' <PERSON> Rappa </PERSON> said. `` Everyone hit the deck and there was a major panic.'' About 50 employees were working on the overnight shift, <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> said. There apparently were no life-threatening injuries. A supervisor for <ORGANIZATION> Dover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said 12 Hercules employees had been brought in. Nine of them and about half a dozen townspeople were treated and released and three employees were admitted, with injuries ranging from back pains to a concussion. All were in stable condition, said supervisor <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Treverrow </PERSON>. An explosion on Feb. 22, 1985, at the company's <LOCATION> Sayerville </LOCATION> plant, about 20 miles to the southwest, killed an employee and injured four other people. <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said the material that exploded Sunday was a smokeless propellant used in shotgun shells. He said that to limit damage, the plant is divided into compartments that each contain no more than 1,000 pounds of gunpowder. The gunpowder plant is located in a somewhat isolated area near several small towns. `` There are windows blown out throughout the area,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hass </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Randolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, about three miles from <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>. Police said they received about 200 damage reports. `` We're assisting, standing by at the businesses in terms of looting that may occur,'' <PERSON> Hass </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said a fire caused by the blast was put out by 8 a.m.. A resident of <LOCATION> Flanders </LOCATION>, about five miles away from the plant, said he was awakened by four loud explosions `` It blew me right out of bed,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>. `` At 5:05 one went off, then three more went off. The blinds blew right out from the window.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who lives half a mile from the plant, said: `` We saw the flames go up and then we heard an explosion. The first one felt like an earthquake. The second one blew out the windows of my house and busted the garage door right off the frame.'' <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spagnola </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> agent with an office in a shopping center about a mile from the plant, said the explosion shook the blinds at his house in <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION> 13 miles away. `` I'm definitely upset. Who needs this?'' <PERSON> Spagnola </PERSON> said. `` It's lucky it was n't a weekday.

 Smoke from burning vehicles cast a pall over Tiananmen Square Sunday morning after violence that will leave a permanent scar on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The numbers of dead and wounded from military attacks on demonstrators were estimated in the hundreds. Massive arrests are inevitable along with purges in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership. The military action made it clear the government was willing to use brutal force against mainly unarmed and peaceful demonstrators to ensure the privileges and power of an aging leadership and to perpetuate the political system. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 84-year-old senior leader, may have forfeited his place as one of the 20th century's great statesmen _ his 10 years of economic reforms tarnished by his willingness to have blood shed rather than relinquish political power. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, who refused to meet with students and discuss their pleas for greater democracy and instead declared martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 20, has won the odium of millions. Other elder leaders who dredged up their hard-line ideologies rather than listen to the pulse of the nation also will be known as men who sanctioned the killings of young idealists. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> betrayed the chants of the students that `` the people's army loves the people'' _ reflecting the respect many Chinese had for the army until Sunday morning. The crushing of the protests reaffirmed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s philosophy that political stability is crucial for economic modernization and social unrest is intolerable. But his quest for stability may be in jeopardy. Military force will not quiet the resentment of official corruption expressed by the students at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. Troops in the streets may drive anti-government and anti-party expressions underground for a while but they can not eradicate them. Student leaders, referring to government suppression, spoke of a `` long winter'' coming that will affect the nation's faltering economic plans. With the government divided and weakened by strife, problems of inflation, unemployment and labor unrest will be unattended. If the conservatives push through their purge of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and other moderates who opposed the crackdown, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> could be deprived of a generation of creative and progressive thinkers. The flow of desperately needed foreign investments will suffer because of the political crisis. Tourism will decline. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, long at odds over human rights issues, could be heading for cooler relations that will involve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness to provide technology and economic assistance. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Saturday he deeply deplored the decision to use force `` against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of life.'' Chinese leaders often note <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 4,000-year history and say the Chinese have the wisdom and patience to outlast crises of the moment. But Chinese observing the rapid changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will not be satisfied with reciting catechisms of communism and the evils of bourgeois liberalization. Chinese need only look back at the last Tiananmen Incident on April 5, 1976, to note that violence can destroy those who initiate it. On that date a radical clique seeking to cement its power ordered out military units that killed about 100 people who had gone to the square to mourn the late Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>. Horror and anger at the killings led to events that brought about the downfall of the radicals six months later and the emergence of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>.

 Chinese PremierLi Peng, in a statement taped before Sunday's bloody crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, pledged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to work to improve the world environment and concluded that the prospects for people are `` bright.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, dressed in a Western-style suit, recorded the statement for a global television broadcast from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> called `` Our Common Future,'' which was intended to raise environmental consciousness. `` Human beings are now facing challenges from the gradual warming of the climate on the global scale,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said in Chinese. `` To curb the development of the tendency requires common efforts by many countries and the whole world as well.'' `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, as a member of the international community, will steadfastly honor its commitments,'' he said. `` I believe that advanced countries should take more responsibility for environmental problems and should make a higher commitment.'' `` The prospects for human beings is bright,'' he concluded in the recorded translation. The celebrity-filled broadcast Saturday, aimed at more than 1 billion people, was picked up satellite feeds from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and elsewhere. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> recorded the statement before Chinese troops stormed Tiananmen Square on Sunday to remove pro-democracy demonstrators occupying it.

<TEXT>
 A ruptured pipeline spilled about 13,200 gallons of crude oil into the <LOCATION> Yampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, home to two endangered species of fish, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> line near here broke open early Friday, said <LOCATION> Moffat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Corriveau </PERSON>. It was discovered when an oil slick was spotted on the <LOCATION> Yampa </LOCATION> three miles below the point where the pipe crosses the northwestern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> river. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> officials immediately turned off the pumps to the 6-inch diameter line, stopping the flow of oil within a few hours, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, the company's area manager in Casper, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> officials estimated that about 300 barrels, or about 13,200 gallons, spilled into the river. Crews were immediately dispatched to throw oil-collection booms across the river. `` The spill is in the No. 1 area for the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> squawfish,'' which is endangered, said state Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> biologist <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyus </PERSON>. `` In the next few weeks, the squawfish will be in the peak of their spawning season.'' The endangered humpback chub also swims in the <LOCATION> Yampa </LOCATION>, as do game fish such as pike, trout and catfish. The 106-mile pipeline links an oilfield near <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> with storage tanks near <LOCATION> Wamsutter </LOCATION> in south central <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. It was built 45 years ago, and rebuilt in 1986, and is pipeline is buried 3 feet underground. `` I do n't think there's any suggestion of sabotage, but we're investigating and cleaning up at the same time,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said The oil, traveling downstream at about 4 mph, is expected to reach the <LOCATION> Yampa </LOCATION>'s confluence with the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> late Saturday or early Sunday, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Knoy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> office said Saturday. The oil will have to pass through rapids, which will help break it up, <PERSON> Knoy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Knoy </PERSON> said that if <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of the spill's size was correct, no long-term cleanup will be needed. The cause of the rupture was being investigated, officials said.

 Chinese students and Chinese-Americans around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reacted with anguish and anger Saturday to bloodshed in their homeland and called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to condemn the military assault on protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` Oh my God! Oh my God!'' cried <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Soon </PERSON>, 32, breaking into sobs as she listened to radio reports in a park across from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>. `` How can the government kill? Those are my brothers and sisters in the square and they are being murdered.'' About 300 protesters gathered at the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Chinese and Chinese-Americans also took their fear and anger to the streets in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, N.Y. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> held a silent tribute. `` It's so horrible,'' <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> said during a rally at the Chinese consulate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by more than 300 chanting, screaming and weeping protesters. `` I ca n't believe they used the army _ the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> _ on the people,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Liang </PERSON>, a Chinese-American. `` This hurts very much.'' A smaller demonstration, attended by Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, was held in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> within sight of the Statue of Liberty. `` All of us here must say no to the government of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and to the military suppression in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' organizer <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lui </PERSON> told the crowd. `` Down with a government that kills students,'' said a sign carried by accountant Ivy Ng. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, about 50 people staged a sit-in on the steps of Chinese consulate, weeping as the protesters played a recording of what they said were telephone conversations with relatives and friends in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as they witnessed the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sweep of Tiananmen Square. `` We are very disappointed and angry with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leung </PERSON>, a protest organizer and student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>. `` We urge the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities to make every effort to support human rights and stop the bloodshed.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement from <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, Saturday, `` I deeply deplore the decision to use force against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of life.'' He called for `` nonviolence, restraint and dialogue.'' It was early Sunday in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, 13 hours ahead of the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, when Chinese troops stormed through masses of pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, shooting and beating hundreds of people. At least 500 were reported killed. In <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, about 250 Chinese students marched around the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION>. Wearing black armbands and green and white ribbons, a Chinese symbol of mourning, they bowed their heads in memory of the slain. At a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Xia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ge </ORGANIZATION>, a 31-year-old graduate student, said, `` I'm worried about my brother. The army is just shooting people. He may be dead.'' `` I'd like to be there with them, but I think we can also do something here in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Lam </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> demonstration organizer. `` I hope we get people outside of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to support this movement, which is not for or against any political party, but just for democracy.'' About a dozen organizers, most of them students and professionals from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, distributed blue ribbons to passers-by at the Sun Yat Sen Memorial Statue in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> `` The ribbons stand for freedom, dignity and hope for the students in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Leung </PERSON>. An <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> state senator who returned Friday from a three-week exchange program in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said that when his group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politicians met with the protesters they seemed to be bracing for confrontation. `` You could sense that there was an uneasiness,'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pate </PERSON> said. `` They said they knew that there was a crackdown coming.'' <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, a scholar who met husband <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the 1970s and wrote two books about that country with him, said the violence created a serious potential for civil war. `` I think that until today many students and intellectuals believed that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was genuinely trying to reform itself from within,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. `` But with the results of today's actions, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> party has lost any semblance of legitimacy for these people. These people feel deeply betrayed; they're deeply angry,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, who works for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a think tank in <LOCATION> Elkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. The crackdown could badly damage <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ability to attract needed dollars through tourism, exports and investments, a professor said. `` It's not hard to imagine that a lot of people are going to be reluctant to put money into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now for obvious reasons,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political science professor <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. He noted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is second only to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in providing tourists to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which he said netted $ 2 billion from that industry last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> interrupted a debate on a prison overcrowding bill to stand in silence as a salute to the Chinese students.

 A CBS News correspondent and cameraman were detained by the Chinese army while an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> crew had to dodge police and bullets during the bloody suppression of the protest in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> early Sunday. It was not immediately clear whether any of the journalists were formally arrested or were being detained to prevent coverage of Chinese troops that stormed <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, killing and wounding scores of people. `` It's been very intense and tragic. They're seeing acts of heroism that I do n't think anyone expects to see in a lifetime,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON>, senior vice president of news for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, said of journalists at the scene. `` I've never heard the kind of strain in people's voices I've heard today A lot of fear is coming through on the phone lines,'' he said. <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> cameraman and sound man were unable to contact the network for more than four hours after they got caught in the chaos while recording events on the southern end of the square. `` They got trapped on one side of the square,'' <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON> said. `` They literally had to go block by block taking cover in houses as they went along because police kept clearing the streets. They were shot at twice by police before they could get a couple of miles to the hotel.'' CBS News Correspondent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> and cameraman <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> were apparently taken away by the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> shortly after 4 p.m. as they described the assault on the square, said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>. `` We're making every effort to locate them but it's very difficult,'' he said. When <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> last heard from <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, he was describing the scene at the square. `` OK, we've got to get out of here,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said in an increasingly shaky voice. `` They -LRB- the army -RRB- are going after <PERSON> Derek </PERSON>. They're ripping away his camara. They are coming for us. We are trying to get away.'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said the sound of gunfire was then heard in the background and <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> could be heard over his cellular telephone, which was left on, saying either `` Oh no, oh no'' or `` I'll go, I'll go.'' Two Chinese-Americans in <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>'s crew _ <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Leong </PERSON>, a soundman, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lum </PERSON>, an assistant _ were able to blend in with the crowd and returned to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leong </PERSON> reported that none of the four were injured and another CBS correspondent later said he believed <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> were taken into the Great Hall by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leong </PERSON> later said: `` We were filming the event. Suddenly, army soldiers appeared five feet behind us. They just grabbed the camera, yanked it down. About five seconds after they grabbed they camera they began to shoot'' into the crowd. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Wessner </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said all their broadcast crew members were safe. `` Everything is fine. All our crews are fine,'' she said. She said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities have not taken action to prevent the crews from doing their jobs. A <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> producer, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, was carrying videotapes through Tiananmen Square Sunday as the troops moved in when she was approached by military officials who demanded that she turn the tapes over. `` Her tapes were taken away and she slipped away before she could get into any trouble with the authorities,'' said <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, assistant foreign editor at <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> headquarters. The cable news program has two correspondents and three crews in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> said the correspondents have been working out of their hotel room while the crews were out in the square during the massacre. To make up for the lack of video footage, <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> has been using still photographs taken by one of the crew, <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> said. `` It's probably one of the most emotional days any of our people have been through over there,'' <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, considered a potential candidate for mayor of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Saturday night that he intends to move into a home he owns in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> once renovations are completed. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that he had not made any decision on whether he make the capital his legal voting residence _ a move he would be required to make by November if he is to become a candiate for mayor in the city's 1990 elections. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will probably move into the house in August or September, said a source close to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a long-time <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> resident, purchased a home in the district four years ago, but it has remained vacant and in need of substantial repairs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> began renovation work on the home this year. Asked if he intends to move into the home when the work is finished, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` Of course, yes.'' Asked if he intends to make it his legal residence and to register to vote in the city, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> answered, `` we have not made such a decision.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said repeatedly that he is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> several times a week and he wants to live in the house rather than stay at a hotel. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has the object of criminal investigations involving drugs and has been beset by a series of embarrassing disclosures about his personal life. A federal grand jury is investigating <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s repeated visits to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel room of a man, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who was later convicted on drug charges in the <LOCATION> Virgins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> faces more charges here. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> is completing his third term and is considering seeking another term. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> are long-time friends from the civil rights battles of the 1960s, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said he would not run against <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> for the mayoral position. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has declined to say what he will do if <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> declines to run for a fourth term, as some <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> advisers have urged. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> organization plans to expand its <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices and establish most of its political and lobbying operations in the city, a source in the organization said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has n't decided whether to make <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> the principal headquarters of the organization, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Cracks Discovered in Nuclear Repository Test Rooms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT MYGATT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cracks found in the ceilings and floors of two test rooms in an underground nuclear waste repository could cause problems with worker safety and waste retrieval, a technical oversight expert said Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, however, had anticipated the cracks in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant test rooms in southeastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and is still aiming for a September opening date, said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON>, an agency spokesman. <ORGANIZATION> WIPP </ORGANIZATION> is a DOE project designed to store plutonium-contaminated waste related to defense 2,150 feet below the surface in ancient salt beds 26 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lokesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which is helping to monitor the project, said the cracks pose two potential problems _ worker safety and the ease with which waste can be retrieved from the site if there are problems. Four test rooms _ each 300 feet long, 33 feet wide and 13 feet high _ were excavated in March and April 1983. Researchers are using the rooms to study the the behavior of salt collapsing around 55-gallon drums of nuclear waste, <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON> said. `` Soon after the rooms were excavated, it was found that the rate of -LRB- collapse -RRB- was three to four times higher than predicted,'' he said. That was a good sign, because the faster the rooms close, the faster the waste will become entombed, <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON> said. The drums are expected to corrode away in 20 years, he said. But in 1985, a 4-inch-wide crack appeared wall-to-wall in the floor of one of the rooms when 3-foot-diameter holes were being drilled, <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON> said. `` That was of concern because it showed salt moved in fast but it was cracking because of impurities in the salt,'' he said. Then, in 1987, the DOE found two continuous fractures above the roofs of two other test rooms _ one about 3 -LCB- feet above the ceiling and another about 7 -LCB- feet above, <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON> said. `` It posed dangers to workers who had equipment in the room, so the <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> decided to clear out the rooms ... or have limited-access rooms,'' said <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON>, who learned about the cracks May 2. <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said the rooms are supposed to come down. `` It's just an experiment,'' he said. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weart </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> WIPP </ORGANIZATION> scientist for <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, said the anticipated, desirable effects of so-called salt creep `` have been considered and retrieval is still assured.'' <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said analysis of the cracking was not included in a supplemental Environmental Impact Statement because there are established mining procedures to prevent problems from the cracks. The procedures includied reinforcing the two rooms with the most recent cracks with rock bolts. No waste will be placed in the unbolted rooms, <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weart </PERSON> said the rock bolts will assure that no loose slabs of salt could fall and breach a waste drum, assuring `` adequate stability through the retrieval period.'' <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON>, however, contended that if <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> officials `` put thousands of drums ... in the rooms to be taken out, there might be a problem in retrieving the waste because one can not be absolutely be certain that rock-bolting will keep the ceiling as well as the floor from buckling.'' The DOE has a five-year experimental and operational phase in which to put waste in the rooms and take it out. `` The whole thing lies on the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> plan _ do they want to place waste temporarily instead of permanently? If they were simply to make the decision permanently, then we would not have to worry about these questions,'' he said. <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON> said his group `` would simply like the DOE not to put a large quantity of waste underground without first making certain that they need to leave it there.'' His group, funded by the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>, is charged with technical evaluation of WIPP for the health and safety of the public and the environment.

<HEAD>$20 Million Con Man Receives Stiff Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man convicted of bilking hundreds of people of $ 20 million through a pyramid scheme received a 15-year prison sentence with an unusual 10-year probation, but promised investors they'd get their money back. Authorities, however, said the reimbursement plan that <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> proposed Friday was just another attempt to mislead investors in his SH Oil and Gas Exploration company. Circuit Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bartow </LOCATION> sentenced <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> on Wednesday to 15 years in prison, and banned him from owning an expensive home, driving an exotic automobile or doing consulting work for 10 years after his release. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 38, will also be prohibited from making more than $ 30,000 a year during the probation, and must give lectures on the evils of white-collar crime at colleges and high schools. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who has also been sentenced to 10 years behind bars on federal bank fraud violations, could be released from prison after four years. His attorney, <PERSON> Montjoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Trimble </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said he would appeal <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON>'s probation sentence. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> pleaded guilty in March to 98 state felony charges. He was accused of cheating about 700 investors out of $ 20 million between 1979 and 1987 through a $ 125 million pyramid scheme. A creditors meeting at bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> on Friday marked the first time that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> answered questions from both investors and investigators since the state closed SH Oil in December 1987. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> promised 50 investors who attended that he would provide a reimbursement plan to `` handle any and all alleged shortfalls you've had since SH Oil was closed.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> did n't elaborate on the plan during the meeting, but said it was designed to refund lost investments within 10 to 15 years. He said the plan would pay investors $ 1 to $ 1.5 million annually for nine to 14 years, then pay them a lump sum of $ 11.5 million to $ 18 million in 10th or 15th year. Attorney <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, hired to help <ORGANIZATION> SH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>'s federal trustee, called <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s plan `` Ouija board'' economics. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the trustee administering $ 10 million to $ 15 million worth of seized SH Oil assets, said the reimbursement plan is `` taking assets and playing investment games with them.'' `` I say just give the money back to creditors and let them manage their own money,'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy Feb. 24. He claimed assets of about $ 15 million and liabilities of about $ 250 million. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who remains free on $ 350,000 in state and federal bonds, is scheduled to report to <LOCATION> Saufley </LOCATION> federal prison near <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> on Wednesday, his attorney said.

<HEAD>Health Workers Say Prostitution and Prejudice Hindering AIDS Efforts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prostitution and prejudice against homosexuals are hindering efforts to control the spread of AIDS in developing countries, a group of international health workers said Saturday. They spoke in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS opens Sunday and 12,000 delegates are expected to attend. Prostitution has been a major factor in the `` wildfire-like spread of AIDS through <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouli </PERSON>, head of an AIDS education project in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. `` Because of high levels of unemployment ... young women often have no practical alternatives to prostitution.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has received reports of 23,000 cases of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but many cases are not reported and the figure is believed to be closer to 100,000. Poverty also has contributed to the large numbers of male prostitutes in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Natee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teerarojjanapongs </PERSON>, a Thai specialist. He said there have been few attempts to educate <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s homosexuals and test them for the presence of the virus of the deadly disease <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaminsky </PERSON>, a Costa Rican community health worker, said that in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries most AIDS victims have been homosexual men and hemophiliacs. Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries have reported 11,000 AIDS cases to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The number of AIDS victims in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is nearing 100,000. Ms. <PERSON> Kaminsky </PERSON> said poor relations between police and Latin American homosexual communities have hampered the detection and prevention of AIDS. `` Lack of trust in the authorities has been a major obstacle,'' she said. `` Homosexuality has been repressed by the police, gay bars have been closed and gays have been pursued.'' A government-sponsored television campaign in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> to educate the public about AIDS encountered strong social opposition, said <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrera </PERSON>, a Santiago-based health worker. When the messages were broadcast in March following long delays, they were aimed exclusively at the heterosexual population and contained no concrete information on prevention of AIDS, he said. African governments are struggling to control the AIDS epidemic, the health workers from that continent said. A study in the <LOCATION> Kagera </LOCATION> region of northwestern <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> found 4,000 orphans were AIDS carriers, said Dr. <PERSON> F.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owenya </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker. He said that in addition to prostitution in the region, the common practice of sharing of unsterilized instruments such as razor blades and safety pins to pierce ears has contributed to the spread of AIDS.

<HEAD>Man Hangs On to Raised Drawbridge as Wheelchair Rolls Away</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man in a wheelchair found himself caught in the middle of a drawbridge while it was raised, forcing him to hang by his fingertips as his chair plunged into the water, witnesses and authorities said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hisoire </PERSON>, 38, grabbed the edge of the bridge and hung over the Intracoastal Waterway for about two minutes before he was rescued by a man riding his bicycle home. `` I went running like crazy,'' said the rescuer, <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabrowski </PERSON>, 46, who added that at first he thought the man had fallen into the water. `` But when I got there, he was hanging on by his fingers. I grabbed his forearm, then lifted him out by the collar and belt before the bridge went back down.'' <PERSON> Hisoire </PERSON> said he heard the drawbridge bell ring but was distracted because he had been talking with a fisherman. He had almost made it to the center of the span when the tender began raising the middle bridge, a police report said. `` I started yelling and screaming and waving my hands so the man in the shed would see me,'' <PERSON> Hisoire </PERSON> said Friday. `` But he kept raising the bridge, and I kept on sliding down.'' The tender, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Goss </PERSON>, said he checked the bridge before raising it and did not see anyone. An 8-foot sign may have partially blocked his view, police said. `` I never saw that man before in my life until that bridge was closed,'' <PERSON> Goss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hisoire </PERSON>, who was paralyzed from the waist down in January after he fell from a wall onto a concrete walk, said he was thankful that <PERSON> Dabrowski </PERSON> happened along. Police agreed. `` If that bridge would have closed, it would have amputated his arms,'' said <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. `` He would have fallen into the -LRB- water -RRB- and we would have never found him.''

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s former secretary has told federal drug investigators that she was a `` weekend'' cocaine user during 1985-1987 while she was employed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and had access to sensitive government documents, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions that <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent of her cocaine use during the agency's investigation of drug use and sales at nightclubs in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, an exclusive area of the city. Hall, who testified at congressional hearings about her role in disposing of documents in the Iran-Contra affair, told the agent she was a `` weekend'' cocaine user during the three-year period and provided investigators with names of some alleged drug dealers, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted unnamed sources as saying. The former White House aide revealed her drug use to <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents during an interview in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of her attorney, <PERSON> Plato </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacheris </PERSON>, on Aug. 7, 1987, just two months after her Iran-Contra testimony, the sources told the newspaper. `` I am not confirming any part of the story,'' said <PERSON> Cacheris </PERSON>, reached at his home Saturday night. Hall is not a target of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> probe but said she is a potential grand jury witness in the ongoing investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. There were no allegations Hall sold drugs or ever used them at the White House, according to the sources. Hall now lives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> where she is pursuing an acting carrer, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s close friends were surprised to learn of her acknowledged drug use. `` I consider myself her best friend and I ca n't believe this,'' <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, who works at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> public relations firm, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, son of a former Nicaraguan Contra leader who dated <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> in 1986 said he never saw her use drugs on the occasions he accompanied her to several <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> nightspots.

<TEXT>
 The wife of hostage <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> continued a `` personal odyssey'' into her husband's past Friday to mark the end of his fourth year of captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` It's very, very special for me to be here,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> at an outdoor ceremony on the campus at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where she met and married <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> when both were students in the 1950s. Mrs. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> arrived in Ames from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, where she had visited the farm of her husband's family. On June 9, she will participate in a ceremony for her husband at <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, where the couple taught before leaving for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` We went as a team, and we are still there as a team, and we are still working together,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>. She has continued teaching at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> since her husband's abduction on June 9, 1985. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> was dean of agriculture at the school. `` I'm doing a personal odyssey for <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> _ to go to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s sources and gather a vitality and strength that I can take back to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 55, told a crowd of about 40 people gathered under the bell tower at the center of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> campus. After the ceremony, the school's bell tolled 48 times _ once for each month <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> has been held hostage. `` I will take this back to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and we will get it into the newspaper so that <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> will know he has this lifeline,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>. She spoke in front of a grove of trees tied with yellow ribbons. Beside her was a banner with her husband's picture and the words, `` We have not forgotten.'' She said she harbors no bitterness toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, which has been unable to obtain the release of Sutherland or eight other Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, also an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> graduate, was captured March 16, 1985. Mrs. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> said she hopes the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration can make progress that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was unable to accomplish as president. `` We have a chance to do something with the new administration,'' she said. `` We hope that <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> will be out before the next year elapses,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, interim director of university relations at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, presented Mrs. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> with a book containing signatures of <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> students, faculty and other Iowans urging the release of <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> and the other hostages. `` We hope that it can get to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> to show that there is solid and broad-based support for him and the others in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> told her. `` We pledge to continue these observances for as long as they're necessary.''

 Gunmen killed a Roman Catholic priest, two policemen and four civilians in separate attacks, and police said Friday they increased security for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s police chief after learning he is on a drug cartel's assassination list. Also Friday, leftist guerrillas freed four engineers of the Brazilian state oil company <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION> who were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and held 43 days in the tropical interior, a company official said. The Rev. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON> was killed Thursday by unidentified gunmen near <LOCATION> Tierralta </LOCATION>, about 280 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> in an area where guerrillas are active, authorities said. Police had no motive for the slaying. Late Thursday, in the western city of <LOCATION> Pereira </LOCATION>, armed men entered a restaurant and sprayed it with gunfire, killing two men and two women and wounding six people, police said. <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> is capital of the coffee-growing state of <LOCATION> Risarlda </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Risarlda </PERSON>'s governor, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Patino </PERSON>, and two aides left the restaurant minutes before the attack, but police said the attack apparently was not directed at them. Early Friday, two policemen were shot to death near <LOCATION> Anoril </LOCATION>, about 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, in an apparent guerrilla ambush. Meanwhile, authorities in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said they were strengthening security for the national police chief, Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, and Gen. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON>, chief of the police force's anti-narcotics division, after discovering they were on an assassination list of the feared <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel of cocaine traffickers. The existence of the list was disclosed by <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, who said it also listed the head of the security police, Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, who escaped a car-bomb assassination attempt Tuesday that left six dead and about 30 wounded. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has been plagued for years by violence carried out by drug traffickers, right-wing vigilantes and leftist guerrilla groups. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferndandez </PERSON>, manager of Colombian operations for <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview broadcast by the national radio network RCN that no ransom was paid for the kidnapped engineers' release Friday. He spoke in <LOCATION> Bucaramanaga </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said political issues were discussed in negotiations with the captors, the pro-Cuban <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The engineers _ three Brazilians and a <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> _ were handed over to <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> labor union officials who had been trying to obtain the men's freedom. Guerrillas seized the four during an April 20 attack on an oil drilling site near <LOCATION> Barancabermeja </LOCATION>, 170 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. It was part of a guerrilla campaign to pressure the governmment into nationalizing <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s petroleum industry. The group this year also has kidnapped mayors, congressmen, other politicians and oil company workers, all of them freed after the captors expounded on their opposition to private and foreign investment in oil. The guerrillas also have regularly bombed important oil pipelines.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate Friday ordered three environmental activists held without bail in an alleged conspiracy to sabotage nuclear plants in three Western states, but released the man described as their `` guru.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitver </PERSON> released <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, 42, the founder of the radical activist group <ORGANIZATION> Earth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ! </ORGANIZATION>, on a $ 50,000 unsecured bond after a 2 -LCB- - hour detention hearing <PERSON> Sitver </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 39, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 37, and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> `` Peggy'' <PERSON> Millett </PERSON>, 35, all of <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, held for trial. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> resident, is charged with conspiracy, while the other three face a count each of conspiracy and three types of property destruction. <PERSON> Sitver </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Millett </PERSON> were flight risks as well as dangers to the community and he called <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> dangerous. In arguing for <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s detention, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Dokken </PERSON> claimed the activist was the ringleader. `` Mr. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> is the worst of the group,'' <PERSON> Dokken </PERSON> said. `` He sneaks around in the background. He was the financier, the leader, sort of the guru to get all of this going. I do n't like to use the analogy of a Mafia boss, but they never do anything either. They just send their munchkins out to do it.'' Defense lawyers said the alleged conspirators always notified the public during what they called `` monkeywrenching'' operations, a reference to a book written by the late <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON> describing a fictional plot by `` eco-raiders'' to blow up a dam. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, said he was gratified by <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s release but added that all the defendants should have been treated with the same consideration. `` Apparently the magistrate felt they were a danger to society. I respectfully disagree,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Millett </PERSON> were committed to attacks on the <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> and Diablo Canyon nuclear complexes of <LOCATION> Wintersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, respectively, and the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> nuclear weapons center near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> testimony based on tape-recorded conversations. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Millett </PERSON> took an undercover agent to a spot near <LOCATION> Wenden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, about 75 miles west of here, late Tuesday to practice knocking down metal powerline towers. The tower they chose provides power for a pumping station of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, which carries water from the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s interior. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents on the ground and in a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> helicopter arrested <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> at the site, but Mrs. <PERSON> Millett </PERSON> slipped through and escaped, Miss <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> was arrested Wednesday morning in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Millett </PERSON> was arrested in Prescott Wednesday afternoon, Miss <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had been investigating the alleged conspiracy since a May 1986 attempt to short-circuit Palo Verde powerlines by throwing metal cables across high-tension wires, she said. Miss <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> testified that the undercover agent accompanied <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> several times and saw <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> give <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> $ 580 and later $ 100 to use in training two - or three-person groups for the strikes <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> opposed the idea of knocking out a CAP pumping station as a useless goad against public sentiment but was enthusiastic about hitting nuclear facilities, Miss <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. The magistrate set <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s surety bond for $ 50,000 but accepted his signature for release. <PERSON> Sitver </PERSON> also ordered <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, who has written a field manual called `` Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkeywrenching,'' to supply names and addresses of any of his publishers. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s book offers instructions on such actions as toppling power-line towersw, putting spikes into trees to discourage loggers with chain saws and knocking bulldozers and helicopters out of order by putting sand in engine oil. But the book carries a disclaimer of being `` for entertainment purposes only,'' saying, `` No one involved with the production of this book ... encourages anyone to do any of the stupid, illegal things contained herein.''

 With much fanfare, authorities Sunday are opening a seven-mile stretch of Interstate 90 that has the dubious distinction of being the most expensive segment of freeway ever built. It is part of a $ 1.46 billion highway project for the mushrooming <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> metropolis to build roads that probably will be badly congested by the time they are completed in 1994. For the time being, the new link between <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> brings welcome relief from the twice-daily creep across the lake's two existing four-lane spans that become jammed by fender-benders. Commuters also say goodbye to an infamous I-90 lane that switched direction depending on the commute. With no barrier to separate traffic, motorists tagged it the `` death lane.'' At about $ 200 million a mile, the freeway has set a record for costliness.

 When 12,000 people gather Sunday for the biggest AIDS conference ever, they will hear grim reports on the social and economic toll of the epidemic but little encouragement about the medical race to stop it. The Fifth International Conference on AIDS is a gathering of all of the big-name researchers and physicians, as well as their supporting casts, who this decade have made AIDS a profession and livelihood as well as a tragedy. The obvious and easy discoveries have been made, so the product of the conference will be thousands of updates on the painstakingly tiny steps necessary for science to learn to thwart the AIDS virus and repair its destruction. No clearly superior successor to AZT, the only approved AIDS drug, is expected to emerge from the 4,500 planned presentations, nor is there likely to be an effective vaccine to protect people from catching HIV, the AIDS virus.

The drought of'88 reduced corn yields 30 percent nationwide and soybean production 20 percent. Then, a dry winter, coupled with dust storms and sub-arctic freezes, devastated winter wheat production, with 39 percent of that crop now deemed either in poor or very poor shape as the harvest approaches.

 The Germans thought the diminutive horse soldiers with Oriental features were devils when they first invaded <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the 5th century with <PERSON> Attila </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> at their head. Nine centuries later, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> recoiled in horror as another Eurasian horde led by <LOCATION> Tamerlane </LOCATION> razed cities and stacked human skulls into towering pyramids. The Chinese even built The Great Wall of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the 3rd century to keep out the havoc-wreaking warriors. But scholars say the Eurasian nomads were not the simple barbarians history often has portrayed them as. Situated along key trade routes linking <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the nomadic tribes had a class system and customs, and invented saddles, the game of polo and bow-stringed instruments. `` They created their own culture in spite of being viewed as barbarians by the sedentary population,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Basilov </PERSON>, chief curator of the Soviet exhibit, `` NOMADS: Masters of the Eurasian Steppe,'' which opened June 4 at the Denver Museum of Natural History. `` We should n't think that they just rode with their animals _ dirty and joyful with their food. Again, they created their own culture.'' The exhibit, which covers a 3,000-year span of the nomadic culture, represents the largest cultural exchange in the field of natural history between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> Featuring nearly 1,400 artifacts, the exhibit began its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour in February at the Natural History Museum of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. It will remain in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> through Sept. 10, and will make its final stop at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The exhibit also has been shown in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The artifacts were collected from eight museums across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and include some that never have been displayed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, museum officials said. <PERSON> Basilov </PERSON>, who has worked on the project for about 10 years, said the three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sites were chosen because they were large enough to accommodate the exhibit's size. From mannequins modeling brilliantly colored clothing to a tiny bronze lock molded in the shape of a deer, the exhibit provides an unusual glimpse into the nomadic culture. Among the artifacts is a full-size suit of golden armor, complete with headdress that was uncovered in the tomb of a warrior. There are examples of weaponry; cooking and eating utensils carved from wood and gourds, and small wooden trunks. The yurt, a rounded tent-like structure with a wool covering to keep out the rain, provides a look at the nomadic home life. Inside, the tent is divided for men and women in the traditional setup. Delicate, carved jewelry and a silver-and-gilt saddle arch and other ornaments also are in the display. Roaming along the Eurasian Steppe, a grassland area ranging from northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the nomadic tribes thrived from 800 B.C. into the early 20th century. Some of the well-known leaders were <PERSON> Attila </PERSON> the Hun, and <PERSON> Kublai </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tamerlane </LOCATION>, descendants of <PERSON> Genghis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>. The tribes moved animal herds from pasture to pasture, and traveled along the <LOCATION> Silk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, a major trade route used to transport silk and other goods from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Museum officials said the nomads have been credited with helping develop economic trade, and sharing ideas on religion, art and technology. `` They invented their own dwellings that could be transported from one place to another,'' <PERSON> Basilov </PERSON> said. `` They thought about the possibility to make everything they possess light, not heavy, not breakable, so convenient to their way of life.'' Among their inventions were the trousers, saddles and harnesses for horses and bow-stringed instruments, the curator said. Although there still are nomads living in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Basilov </PERSON> said they have settled into a more sedentary lifestyle, such as sheepherders moving their flocks between permanent dwellings. But, the way of life still has `` the flavor of their own essence of culture. Some elders that live today remember that in their youth they had this way of life,'' he said. <PERSON> Basilov </PERSON> received his doctorate in anthropology from the <ORGANIZATION> Mikloukho-Maclay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethnography </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He has held several positions, including senior researcher and scientific secretary at the institute. Currently, he heads the institute's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> Research. He believes the exhibit is unique because its message is that the nomads were not just barbaric tribes. Although <PERSON> Basilov </PERSON> has worked on the project for more than a decade, it still fascinates him: `` The more you work, the more interest you have in different fields of this very interesting culture.''

<HEAD>Rumblings in Mount St. Takeover</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Like the bubbling lava burps and smoke plumes of a sleepy volcano, the dormant corporate takeover business is showing signs of pre-eruption life. The biggest belch came from financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who dumped his 17.3 percent stake of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> this past week for $ 2.07 billion cash in one behemoth trade. It took three big Wall Street brokerages to handle the record block of 42.32 million shares sold for $ 49 each. The deal riveted attention on <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and raised speculation he would use the money to buy, or threaten to buy, another big company. A flurry of speculative buying in <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock suggested that piggybacking investors reckoned <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> would chase the oil-steel giant, one of his old targets. He remains a significant stockholder in <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> news was all the more dramatic because it came against the background of a slump in the mergers & amp; acquisitions business this year after a frenzy in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a research concern that follows takeover activity, says the value of deals tumbled to $ 74.36 billion in the first quarter of this year from $ 137.17 billion a year earlier. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, of course, declined to disclose his takeover agenda. But the cunning investor has become known for bold and unpredictable moves that sometimes have stupefied followers and critics alike. More than three years ago he outfoxed <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Later he stunned the airline business by making a last-minute though unsuccessful run at <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Contrary to widespread expectations, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> not only has kept <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> but evidently turned it into a moneymaker. He even has ordered a fleet's worth of new <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> jetliners, contradicting some union claims that he would n't invest money in <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, which has some of the industry's oldest jetliners. At the same time, however, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has been using <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s assets to raise money for other adventurous investments _ including his much publicized stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> as it struggled out of bankruptcy a year ago. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> plans to raise an additional $ 300 million soon by selling <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> bonds backed by collateral that ranges from airport-landing slots to spare light bulbs. The Wall Street Journal calls the offering `` light bulb bonds.'' If <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> combined that money with the cash raised from the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock sale, he could borrow several times that amount to launch a takeover of a company worth at least $ 10 billion. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s maneuvering was n't the only rumble that stock speculators heard this past week. Unionists at two other airlines, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, were maneuvering to align themselves with financiers who expressed buying interest in those companies. Also, a Canadian company chasing <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donuts </ORGANIZATION> upped its stake in the chain. And in what some would call the morbid side of takeover speculation, toy giant <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock shot up on word that chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassenfeld </PERSON> was hospitalized in intensive care with pneumonia. Such speculation often accompanies serious illness or deaths of top executives. In other business news this past week: _ Government statistics suggested the economy has slowed, easing pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to keep interest rates up and rallying the stock and bond markets Though unemployment fell in April, new-job growth hit a three-year low. Other figures showed construction spending barely rose in April and productivity shrank in the first quarter. _ Retailers reported depressed sales for April, suggesting consumers are cutting back to save money and pay debts The figures also suggested <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 1 retailer, suffered from declining shopper interest in its revamped low-price strategy aimed at competing with fast-growing rivals. _ Next-century innovations were announced for two staples of many American homes, the television and the Bible <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said it was developing a `` passive people meter'' that would actually watch viewers to determine which ones were watching what shows and when they left the room. Franklin Computer, a Mt. <LOCATION> Holly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> company, unveiled an electronic version of the Scriptures delivered by a new hand-held computer.

<TEXT>
 Financial analysts and investors who proclaimed a couple of months ago that interest rates were peaking are feeling pretty good about themselves right now. Since late March, long-term interest rates in the government securities market have fallen from roughly 9.3 percent to 8.5 percent. As for short-term interest rates, yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills have dropped over the same period from 9.4 percent to 8.6 percent. The nation's major banks, which have raised their prime lending rates by stages from 8.5 percent to 11.5 percent since early 1988, now seem poised to lower them by at least half a percentage point. All they are awaiting, analysts say, is the slightest signal from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> that it is ready to begin relaxing its credit policy in response to evidence that the economy has slowed. The latest exhibit for that case came Friday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported employment growth of 101,000 in May, only about half of what private economists had forecast. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, said what expansion occurred during the month was `` very slow'' and limited to just a few industries. The news helped propel the stock market to new highs since the 1987 crash, extending a rally that began last November. `` The market is going up for the right reasons,'' declared <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeb </PERSON> in his investment advisory letter Indicator Digest. `` In the past two weeks evidence has begun to mount that the economy is decelerating in an orderly fashion, making a ` soft landing' an increasingly likely prospect.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> foresees this sort of `` soft landing'' script: Interest rates continue downward as the inflation rate settles back to an annual rate of about 4 percent in the second half of the year. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would certainly ease within the next month or so,'' he added, `` and the stock market would continue to rise, outperforming cash instruments, as investors appraised lower interest rates and a continued high level of corporate profits.'' Many investors evidently saw similar visions in the past week, bidding up stocks to new recovery highs after a brief round of selling following the Memorial Day holiday on Monday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at 2,517.83, up 23.06 from the week before. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index gained 2.18 to 181.49; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 6.42 to 451.63, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 4.46 at 360.47. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 194.15 million shares a day, up from 169.79 million the week before. Amid the growing number of enthusiasts talking up the possibility of record highs in the Dow before the year is out, there are still quite a few doubters. Just suppose, some ask, that lower interest rates encourage the pace of the economy to pick up again and inflation comes back to haunt the markets just when that demon was supposedly subdued? `` Recent euphoria has tended to overlook a few unpleasant details,'' says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We suspect that the anti-inflationary struggle in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is less of a complete victory than the current consensus believes.'' Before that battle is won, he says, rates may well climb back above their recent highs. And that is likely to lead, he maintains, to a `` hard landing'' _ in other words, a recession _ in 1990.

The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that civilian joblessness fell from April's rate of 5.3 percent, with a decline in the number of people looking for work offsetting an anemic expansion of non-farm payrolls.
