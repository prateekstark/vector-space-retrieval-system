<HEAD>Report: Soviets Pulling Back From Threat to Stop Destroying SS-23</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviets have pulled back from a recent threat to stop destroying a missile covered by last year's treaty covering medium-range nuclear missiles, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Thursday editions. The missile is the SS-23, one of the weapons that will be taken apart under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact that went into effect last year. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had told journalists in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> recently that Soviet destruction of the SS-23s might be halted if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> deployed a similar type of missile. The SS-23 has a range of slightly more than 300 miles, the minimum distance set by the INF treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its western allies are considering deployment of a new Lance missile with a range just under the limit set by the treaty. The Soviets have gone ahead and moved almost two dozen SS-23s from a storage site to an elimination site, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported, quoting unnamed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet sources. All the SS-23s must be destroyed by Dec. 31, but ample time remains to meet the deadline, the officials said. While the Soviets have n't yet destroyed any of the 239 SS-23s deployed before the pact took effect, they have destroyed training missiles and launchers, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators have found evidence to support the possibility that murder or suicide was involved in the explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard the battleship USS Iowa, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources as disclosing `` some disturbing facts'' about a surviving sailor who stands to collect $ 100,000 from the insurance policy of a gunner's mate killed in the explosion April 19. Investigators found gunpower and blasting caps in a search of the belongings of Gunner's Mate 3rd Class <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, 21, two years ago after he was arrested for stealing a car, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said. In a search of his home after the explosion, investigators found one of the burlap patches that gunners insert between bags of powder to clean the barrels of the battleship's huge guns during firing, the network said. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was quoted in published reports last week as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> created homicide or suicide scenarios involving him and <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, 25, to make them scapegoats for an explosion investigators can not otherwise explain. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> has denied any blame for the explosion, and has said that in response to investigators' questions, he denied a homosexual relationship with <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said that because the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has failed to find an accidental cause for the explosion, it believes it may have been caused deliberately through placement of a detonating device in one of the burlap patches, which normally would have been handled by <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. However, his sister, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON>, said Wednesday night that reports that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> helped load the fatal shell were inaccurate. `` My brother was n't on the duty roster that day,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` He was in the turret but he was not on duty that day.'' She said she has talked to a <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> investigator looking into the accident. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> that he was depressed when his friendship with <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> broke down last year. The family also said that at age 17, <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> threatened suicide when another relationship ended, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said other sources, which it did not identify, have learned that before the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> went on maneuvers off <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> wrote several letters that could be construed as farewell messages. Mrs. <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> said her brother was not a homosexual. `` He was a loner,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` He did a lot of reading. `` He wanted to be in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` My dad was a gunner's mate on destroyer in World War II.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> said earlier Wednesday that she is contesting the fairness of <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> collecting $ 100,000 from her brother's insurance policy. A <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent told Mrs. <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s insurance policy, which listed <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> as its beneficiary, would not be paid until the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> completes its investigation of the explosion. She said NIS agents have visited her and her family four times since the explosion to question them about <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> and his relationship with <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> said his son and <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> took out $ 50,000 policies from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> credit union just before their battleship left <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in 1987. The policies carried double indemnities for accidental death, making <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>'s payout $ 100,000. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> had dropped <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, however, as the beneficiary on his policy, said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> said a close friendship between the two men waned because <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was married last year and his wife did not care for <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. She said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> intended to change his beneficiary, too. `` I'm sure he had all intentions of changing it. I'm sure of it,'' she said. `` He had made comments to myself and my parents.'' The Hartwigs will receive a $ 50,000 payout on a separate government life insurance policy. <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, referred questions about the case to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Lt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> of the information office said the investigation of the blast was continuing and `` nothing is categorically rejected.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> would not provide information on how to contact <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, who has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the explosion. `` In my opinion, they have no idea what's going on, what caused it,'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Times-Herald </ORGANIZATION> in a story published Sunday. `` I think they're trying to find an easy way out.'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said he is used to being a scapegoat and that he and <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> often had been harrassed by fellow sailors `` because neither one of us drinks. ... They razz you if you're not out there with them getting trashed.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> said she did not intend to raise the possibility that the explosion was caused deliberately. `` I do n't wany anyone to think, including <PERSON> Ken </PERSON>, that I think he was a murderer,'' she said by phone from her home. `` I do n't think so. Truthfully, honestly, I do n't know the man.''

 <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Okuyama </PERSON> began his career with typical Japanese movie fare: gangster and cute animal movies. Now the ambitious young producer hopes to inspire jaded Japanese with the tragedy of an idealistic rebellion in 1936 which tried to install a military government under the late Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Okayama </LOCATION>'s problem in making the film, due for release June 17, has been that the attempted coup by 22 fervent young right-wing military officers was quashed under orders of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> himself, who was then revered as a living god. The emperor is n't portrayed in the film, but his order against the young rebels, whom <PERSON> Okuyama </PERSON> describes as martyrs, is depicted as a misjudgment that ultimately led <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> into World War II, the producer said. Reflections on the emperor's judgment and the question of his responsibility for the war are acutely sensitive here, although discussion of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s historical role has become freer since his death Jan. 7 at age 87. Historians generally agree <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was a figurehead, wielding little real power. His most famous decision was <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s World War II surrender in 1945, when the government was deadlocked over the issue. But <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> also ordered the 1936 leaders of the coup back to their barracks after two days of assassinations and political turmoil in the `` 2-26 Incident,'' so called because it was launched on Feb. 26. Several coup leaders committed suicide, and others were imprisoned. On July 12, 1936, two civilians and 13 of the rebel officers were executed by firing squad. <PERSON> Okuyama </PERSON>'s movie, `` 2-26'' tells the story of the young officers who led about 1,500 soldiers and nine civilians in a bloody attempt to overthrow the government and install a military regime under <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. The rebels claimed they sought to restore integrity to a nation they believed was corrupted by a political elite living in luxury while millions suffered Depression-era deprivation. Many of the rebels, historians say, were sons of poor farm families who had suffered hunger and seen their sisters sold into prostitution. But in the repressive atmosphere after the failed coup, an opposing faction in the military used the incident to build its own power, eventually establishing a militaristic regime that led <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> into World War II. `` There was an energy and an intensity alive then that has been forgotten in today's <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' the 35-year-old producer said. `` One main reason I wanted to produce this film is because we live in a similar era, when young women prostitute themselves and revelations of political corruption surface every day,'' said <PERSON> Okuyama </PERSON>. `` The only difference is that then we were poor and now we're rich.'' The film is coming out amid outrage over a scandal in which 14 prominent bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on suspicion of bribery and other illegalities, and more than 150 people embarrassed by disclosures that they accepted unlisted shares at discount prices from an employment information firm. `` I wanted to sound an alarm, to use the tragedy and drama of the 2-26 incident to tell people what they do n't want to hear about political corruption and decay,'' <PERSON> Okuyama </PERSON> said. `` Influential people are gathering dirty money. Like the martyrs of 2-26, people should care.'' The film depicts the deaths of the coup leaders as a tragic loss of courageous young men who died still true to their ideals. `` Even though the emperor does n't understand that we were right, history will answer for us,'' says one coup leader before putting a bullet in his head. <PERSON> Okuyama </PERSON> said in an interview that he knew a decade ago that there was material to make a good movie, but it just was n't possible because of a lack of funds, and sensitivities about the emperor The screenwriter did n't want to get involved, he said, but `` finally agreed on the condition we play down politics and aim the movie more toward young people.'' Corporate backers also feared a backlash from right-wing groups that vociferously protest anything they interpret as disrespectful toward the imperial family. `` When we get to the last print, just before distribution, we plan to show the film to some of the major right-wing groups to try to gain their understanding,'' <PERSON> Okuyama </PERSON> said. But he still expects some trouble. `` Actually, I'm very worried just now, very afraid. But even if there's controversy, I think I can explain what we're trying to do.'' The film ends on a note the rightists should appreciate: a clash of gongs and `` Tenno <PERSON> Heika </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzai </PERSON>,'' or `` Long Live the Emperor.''

<DATELINE>SIWA OASIS, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The temple of the Siwan Oracle, where the superstitious young conqueror <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Great </PERSON> was told he was a god, sits in ruin on its hillside perch. <LOCATION> Shali </LOCATION>, a majestic 13th-century fortress that protected Siwans from medieval Bedouin marauders, is a sandcastle of rubble, stripped of its glory by neglect and the oasis' infrequent but devastating desert rains. The village silversmith is gone, along with most of the elaborate jewelry he crafted _ gigantic bangles that jingled from the oasis' richly costumed women. Berber and Sudanese heritage have blended into Siwan life, along with other tongues and cultures carried over Saharan sands to form its roots and distinct language. So much made <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION>, only 85 miles from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, unique in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and much of that is gone. But much is left. As it has for a thousand years, life in <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION> begins before dawn with the muezzim calling Moslems to prayer from minarets of mosques scattered through the oasis' date palms and olive groves. Then a donkey serenade begins. Hundreds bray, echoing through the palms, followed by a chorus of roosters. Early-morning markets open to the cloppety-clop of donkeys pulling kerussahs, family carts driven by caftan-wearing men or boys. Wives and mothers covered head-to-toe in flowing blue embroidered shawls called milayah sit behind with smaller children. Covered kerussahs provide the local taxi service, sharing bumpy roadways with military trucks and, with increasing frequency, tourist buses from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Camels never made it big in <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION>. Donkeys are cheaper. Until the early 1980s, virtually all sounds and sights in <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION> would have been familiar to Siwans centuries earlier. But four years ago a highway became the oasis' umbilical cord to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the Arabic language. The three-hour, 190-mile drive from <ORGANIZATION> Mersa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matrouh </ORGANIZATION> on the western Egyptian coast covers generally the same desert route over which, 2,000 years ago, people from around the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> among them _ trekked for more than a week seeking the wisdom of the famed desert oracle. More recently, buyers for chic boutiques in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have traveled it, taking with them the best jewelry and handicrafts. Siwans have been put on parade for an ever-growing number of often scantily dressed visitors. Television invaded <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION> in 1986, and more than 1,000 sets were sold the first week. Like their fellow Egyptians, <PERSON> Siwans </PERSON> go to bed chatting about the latest plot twists of <LOCATION> Falcon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> or Knots Landing. Young Siwans, now heading in increasing numbers for higher education in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, have far fewer traditions to remember but many more influences to contemplate. But for <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION>'s 10,000 inhabitants, the infusion and confusion has n't been all bad. A year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid project gives them clean water for the first time. Extracted from salty subterranean pools, the desalinated water costs 5 piasters -LRB- just over 2 cents -RRB- a jerrycan, which even the poor can afford, instead of 75 piasters -LRB- 30 cents -RRB- when water was trucked from outside. Electricity supplies remain uncertain and sporadic, but Czechoslavakian generators are being installed that promise a constant power supply. One aid project is working to save <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION>'s soul. More than a year ago, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Perron </PERSON>, then <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, asked Siwan officials what his country could do for their changing oasis. Help us save our heritage, they said. `` Everybody talked for years about how to save <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION>, that its cultural heritage must be saved, but nobody did anything about it,'' said <PERSON> Heba </PERSON> el-Kholy, fund coordinator at the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. The Canadian project aimed to build a traditional Siwan house in the old way, using mudbrick and palm trunks and to teach young women old skills. Now nearing completion, the two-story house going up in the village garden will become a museum dedicated to Siwan culture and a reservoir for handicrafts. Six miles away, in a poor desert village, <PERSON> Khadiga </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> has spent the last year teaching five cheerful girls, aged 11 to 15, to embroider bridal scarves in the Siwan way. Siwan girls, who marry about age 14, must have an extensive bridal trousseau, including seven elaborate wedding dresses. Mrs. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> is among nine women team leaders, each passing along her sewing or basket-making artistry to five girls. The Canadian project has supplied each of Mrs. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON>'s apprentices material for bridal scarves, which can take several months to complete Once finished, she has the option of keeping them or selling them back to the project for 5 Egyptian pounds -LRB- about $ 2 -RRB- each. `` A bride has to have these scarves for her wedding,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> said. `` If she has to buy them ready-made, she will have to pay 75 pounds -LRB- $ 30 -RRB- for one scarf.'' Miss el-Kholy, the Canadian co-ordinator, said she considers both efforts a first step in saving <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION>'s unique traditions. `` Young girls today prefer watching television to making handicrafts,'' she said. `` But once we begin selling the products, and the women can see the results, I believe the traditions wo n't die.

<HEAD>Quirks of Fate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The odds of two unrelated women sharing the same birthdate and similar names are high enough. But they are partners to another quirk: they share Social Security numbers. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> learned three weeks ago that the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> made a freakish mistake years ago and assigned them the same number. Ms. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, whose maiden name was <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, was the first to learn about the mixup. When she was considering buying a house, a mortgage company's printout of her credit history also contained Ms. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s, who was born <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> took the question to the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which told her it stemmed from a clerical error in the early 1970s. Ms. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> called Ms. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> to explain. `` I was dumbfounded,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. `` I could n't understand how two people could have the same Social Security number. I've had this one since it was issued to me when I was a little girl.'' Social Security officials declined to discuss the specifics of this case, but did say such mistakes are rare. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Battistelli </PERSON>, a spokesman at the agency's <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> headquarters, said he had heard of only one similar case. `` The other instance involved twins. By no stretch of the imagination is this a commonplace occurrence,'' he said. <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mull </PERSON> of the Social Security office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said the chances of two people receiving the same number are `` infinitesimal, but it does happen some times.'' But that's of no comfort to the Ms. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. `` The thing that aggravates me is that I have to take time out of my work schedule to solve their problem, their error,'' Ms. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think that's fair. It's an error that should never have occurred.'' What happened is still unclear and the stories the women tell differ with each other and the account provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. What is clear is that both women were born with similar names and two years apart _ Ms. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> on Dec. 12, 1937, in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and Ms. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> on Dec. 12, 1939, in rural <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> at age 15, said she applied for a number while seeking a job as a waitress at a Greyhound bus station in <LOCATION> Elizabethtown </LOCATION> in 1954 or 1955. Ms. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said she applied for a number about the same time in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. The only time Ms. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said she applied for a new card was when she got married in 1957. She says she never applied for another new card in the early 1970s when Social Security officials claim the error occurred. Ms. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said she applied for a new card each time she got married in 1962 and 1984. Ms. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said Social Security officials told her that because she had the number first she could keep her number and that Ms. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> would have to apply for a new one.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The sun, so elusive in a British spring, has been positively beaming down on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> area for so many rainless days that people are in danger of forgetting where they put their umbrellas. Much of the country is sharing the sunshine bonanza. So far, it is the warmest May since 1964. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was the country's sweltriest spot Tuesday. The 84-degree high made it the capital's hottest day in May since official record-taking began in 1948. Temperatures of 82 degrees made the south coast towns of <LOCATION> Bournemouth </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> hotter at the weekend than <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tangier </LOCATION>. It has n't rained in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> since a light shower fell May 13, and the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Weather Center records .032 inches of rain so far _ against an average May rainfall of 2.02 inches. Raincoats hang at the back of the closet, <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> boots are buried by accumulating debris in the car trunk and eager barbecuers have bought out the lawn furniture stocks in some stores and garden centers. Opportunities like this do not arise very often for a nation of picnickers. A good drenching is part of everybody's outdoor dining experience, and the ability to hold on to your plate, your glass and your humor while sprinting for shelter is a basic of British sang-froid. Bookmaker <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> says it faces a $ 170,000 payout if temperatures exceed the 96.6-degree mark reached in 1976, and has shortened its odds from 33-to-1 to 16-to-1. It would lose an additional $ 85,000 if the century's record high of 98 degrees, set in 1911, is exceeded and has dropped odds against this happening to 50-1, a spokesman said. Of course there is still a week left for a deluge, but nothing can take away the 224 hours of sunshine so far. Average May sunshine is 198 hours for the entire month, the weather center said. Londoners are taking all this in their stride. What is left of British reserve seems to have been shelved for the time being as people of all ages walk around the capital with large portions of their anatomy exposed to the sun. Barefoot, barelegged and occasionally bare-chested, they go to the parks and the zoo, eating ice creams and pushing toddlers in strollers. The people of the northern <LOCATION> Calder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> have not had the same good fortune. On Friday, a two-hour rainstorm caused flash floods and two towns had to be evacuated. A bolt of lightning struck 26-year-old <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> as he walked over a hill in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> on Tuesday, but his life apparently was saved by a crucifix he wore around his neck. He suffered damaged ear drums and burns. `` The burning cross has left a perfect mark at the top of his chest,'' said a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Gwynedd </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, speaking anonymously. The <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said `` near monsoon'' rainstorms Tuesday made driving treacherous and caused dozens of road accidents across <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION>. But for most of the nation, television weather forecasters are running out of novel ways to express the good news and some have begun to point out that a cold front edging south from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> might get to northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> by Friday.

 Critics called him a pharoah and said he would resurrect the machine politics of his late father, but one month after his inauguration, even some detractors praise Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> for his political shrewdness. Since taking the oath of office on his 47th birthday April 24, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> has ordered a television-worthy cleanup of City Hall, which he likened to a `` pig pen,'' and called for appointment of an ethics watchdog with subpoena power to root out corruption among all city employees _ even aldermen. He also cut more than $ 40 million from planned city spending, and broke with tradition by ordering parked cars, some driven by city honchos, towed from illegal spaces surrounding City Hall. Even his press secretary found her car missing. And saying he did n't want to be the only survivor of a nuclear attack, he pledged to sell a new, $ 50,000 bullet-proof mayoral limousine ordered before he took office. Visible reforms make good ink, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a political activist and long-time <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> critic who worked for <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s independent challenger in the April 4 election. `` Those are public relations, nice attention-getting moves,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said, calling some of the actions self-serving. `` I think I have to say whatever the motives, he's gotten off on the right foot.'' But, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> added, `` We have n't seen any of the real actions of government yet, and I'm still very, very wary of what his policies ... are going to be.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> faces re-election in the spring of 1991, leading some detractors to call the mayor's actions mere campaign tactics. But <PERSON> Marj </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the mayor, defends his moves. `` I keep wondering when people will finally understand that this is real,'' she said Tuesday. `` These are n't things you do just for show. These are things you do to manage the city responsibly and effectively.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, son of the late boss of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, defeated <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who is black, and Democrat-turned-Republican <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> April 4 for the right to finish out the last two years of the second term of the late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who died in office in 1987. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was the city's first black mayor, and the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> elected <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, a black South Side alderman, to be interim mayor following <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> in the Democratic primary in February. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who called <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> a pharoah at the beginning of the campaign, has criticized the mayor's performance as lackluster. `` <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> made a campaign promise that he would always look to collecting revenue already owed to the city before he would raise taxes,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` Yet ... the first thing he did was to raise water and sewer taxes.'' The increase was drafted under <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, but passed under <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. `` We did reduce it from the previous administration,'' <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Roesser </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and a political analyst close to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> is doing what most politicians do while facing the next election. `` I see nothing nefarious or hollow or not serious at all,'' he said. `` I'm amazed, frankly, at how much reform he has brought.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, a white alderman who supported <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, said he has been pleased with <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s reforms and a push for city efficiency. `` There's still a part of me that's surprised at his political astuteness in the last few weeks,'' <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said. `` I think it sets a critical tone.''

<TEXT>
 The possibility of a wave of homeless headed for its celebrity-soaked shores has <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> in a dither over the notion honorary Mayor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> may have invited a tent city encampment. <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> declared the beach town where <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> and Barbra Streisand live a nuclear-free homeless sanctuary. A nationally syndicated radio talk show host responded by calling for a `` March on <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>'' on Saturday, for which he says he has 15 buses available as far away as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. By Tuesday, at least one bus load of homeless people was organized, in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, and that was enough to have the beach community fretting. `` If God had intended them to live in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, he'd have made them television producers,'' mused <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. The declaration sparking the turmoil read: `` I hereby declare <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> a nuclear free zone, a sanctuary for aliens and the homeless and a protected environment for all life, wild and tame.'' The attention <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> has attracted to the beach town of 19,000 has put pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, which appointed him honorary mayor earlier this month to promote a `` Shop Malibu'' campaign. `` The community is pretty upset,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwood </PERSON>, the chamber's executive vice president, who says she has handled hundreds of telephone calls. <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> is a town with no coin laundry, no car wash, no mortuary and no car lot. It has trendy restaurants and three supermarkets, where it's not unusual to see <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, <PERSON> Whoopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>. Few heads turn when <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> roars by on his motorcycle. <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> is a place where <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Halen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagar </PERSON> can jam at the <LOCATION> Trancas </LOCATION> nightclub without screaming throngs. Homes start at $ 500,000 and go up to $ 20 million, which is the price tag on Miss Streisand's compound. Despite its celebrity-enclave stereotype, most residents are working stiffs with an average annual income of $ 60,000. Sheen neighbor <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> joked on the `` Tonight Show'' that residents were offering to pay for valet parking for the homeless and provide free sunblock. The honorary mayor responded to criticism by declaring <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> a free-speech zone. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said the following night: `` Mayor <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> just declared <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>'s hair a national forest.'' But many local Malibuites are n't amused. The Malibu Inn and Restaurant's `` Dump <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheen </ORGANIZATION>'' marquee _ changed Tuesday to `` Johnny For Mayor'' _ seemed to express prevailing opinion. `` We should disassociate ourselves with him. There is no community that welcomes the homeless,'' said manager <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Casson </PERSON>. Friends of <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>, who has been heavily involved in anti-nuclear weapons protests and the farm workers' grape boycott, pledged to provide food and clothing if homeless people show up. `` We're not going to ask them to leave. We feel those people have suffered enough and they are being used,'' said neighbor <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Olk </PERSON>. Supporter <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> said: `` Homeless people are n't meat.'' New York-based conservative radio talk show host <PERSON> Rush </PERSON> <PERSON> Limbaugh </PERSON>, who has been needling <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> `` left coast'' for years, said his offer of one-way bus tickets to <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> was a fair comment on <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>'s declaration. `` I like to illustrate absurdity with the absurd,'' <PERSON> Limbaugh </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` It is my intention to discredit <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>. The march is purely to embarrass <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> and not <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Limbaugh </PERSON>, who embraces programs making the homeless self-reliant rather than giving them handouts, said he telephoned the chamber to ask where to take his homeless bus and a spokeswoman said, `` There's no place for them here,'' then hung up. `` See! There's no sanctuary. We are going to show them they do n't want you,'' said <PERSON> Limbaugh </PERSON>, conceding his reservations about bringing homeless to <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>. `` I do n't want to be thought of as a cheap theatrical stunt guy.'' <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>, who has been in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> directing <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> and son <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> in the movie `` Count a Lonely Cadence,'' said in his latest missive from <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>: `` I regret that my concern for the poor and the environment was so dishonestly misinterpreted and misused to perpetrate a cruel hoax on 4 million Americans who are already broken beyond any measure of understanding.''

 President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said Tuesday he wo n't leave office early because President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> will not agree on policies to stabilize the economy during a transfer of power. `` We will get to the 10th of December with the extraordinary effort of the Argentine people,'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said in a 14-minute speech broadcast nationwide. His six-year term expires Dec. 10. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had been holding talks on the possibility of an early transition because of the economic crisis. After <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s speech his Cabinet members submitted their resignations. Press secretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> will decide Wednesday whether to accept them. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> told the independent news agency <ORGANIZATION> Diarios </ORGANIZATION> y Noticias Tuesday night that his party did not break off the transition negotiations that were initiated by <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> last weekend. `` We simply were not in agreement with the -LRB- economic -RRB- proposals of the ruling party,'' he said. `` As I said before, I want the president to depart with every honor, without resigning, as befits a man who has struggled for democracy.'' About 3,000 people gathered outside <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday night for what they called a `` hunger march.'' The demonstration was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION> to protest inflation and increased utility rates approved last week by the government. `` There will be no pact or social peace arranged from above, because now begins the struggle and mobilization of those from below,'' <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Echegaray </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told the crowd. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said his <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> will unveil its own economic program by Sunday. `` It will be as hard as you can imagine,'' he said, and suitable for `` an economy of war ... a government in crisis.'' The mood in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> was somber as teachers and other public employees planned strikes for higher wages, stores in the capital marked up prices and some supermarkets rationed purchases. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, 58, defeated presidential nominee <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> of the Radical Civic Union in national elections on May 14. The Peronists won virtual control of both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Instead of giving the economy a boost of confidence, the election was followed by a plunge in value of the austral against the dollar. Interest rates soared to record highs and other key economic indicators grew worse. Inflation is projected at 50 percent this month. Wages are shrinking, unemployment and public anger are rising, the national budget is in deficit, reserves in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> are low and no payments are being made on the foreign debt. Banks and foreign exchange houses were closed Monday and Tuesday as the government increased public utility rates and raised taxes to help balance the budget. Banks will resume restricted operations Wednesday, but exchange houses will remain closed until Monday. Peronists rejected the tariff increases and insisted that the national minimum wage be raised substantially and the federal government bail out provinces _ almost all Peronist-governed _ that could not meet their payrolls. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> earlier indicated he might be willing to take office early. Analysts said he backed out because he counted on the seven-month transition to prepare his own economic program. `` He does n't want to take over in the middle of a crisis he did n't cause,'' said <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, chief economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Mediterranean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> think tank. `` It could be worse in December, but not necessarily.''

<HEAD>Most Americans Are Too Fat, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly two-thirds of Americans are too fat, and more than a third are at least 10 percent over the recommended weights for their height, body build and sex, a nationwide health survey shows. The study, done for <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>, determined that 64 percent of adults age 25 and over could stand to lose at least a few pounds. But fewer than half of those people were trying to shed the extra pounds when polled in November, the study by <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> says. The percentage of overweight Americans is the highest since the magazine began keeping track in 1983, and is up from 59 percent in 1987 and 1986, 62 percent in 1985, 56 percent in 1984 and 58 percent in the first year of the survey. More than a third of Americans are at least 10 percent over the weight recommended for their height, body build and sex by the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> tables used by many doctors, the survey found. Only about one-fifth weigh about what they should, and they are more likely to be `` people in the East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, suburban residents, people in their 30's and 40's, college graduates,'' the magazine said. Slightly more women than men are the proper weight _ 22 percent compared with 20 percent _ and gender aside, only 29 percent of people making more than $ 50,000 a year are appropriately trim, the survey said. `` Weight control becomes more problematic when those who are overweight do not feel overweight,'' the magazine said. One in five surveyed fell into that category, and only 48 percent of those who needed to shed pounds were actively fighting the battle of the bulge, according to the survey. Despite the weight problem, the survey found some good news about Americans' health, including more people who quit smoking and cut down on high-cholesterol foods and more women who examined their breasts monthly for signs of cancer. Overall, it found that people 65 and older are more likely to take preventive health measures than those under 35. Among the findings: _ 48 percent said they try to avoid high-cholesterol foods, up 6 percentage points from 1987 However, fewer people are trying to get enough vitamins and minerals, to avoid eating too much salt and sugar and to eat fish twice a week, the survey said. _ 36 percent said they exercise strenuously, sustaining an accelerated heart and pulse rate for at least 20 minutes, at least three days a week That proportion has remained stable over the past five years. _ 63 percent reported that they feel under great stress at least once a week, up from 55 percent in 1983 Stress is reported more frequently by those in the lowest and highest income brackets, the survey found. _ Americans are continuing to kick the cigarette habit, with the percentage of smokers declining to 26 percent, down from 30 percent in 1983 _ The rate of heavy drinkers _ 11 percent _ has changed little since 1983, but the proportion of adults who say they never consume alcohol rose 5 points over the period to 39 percent _ One out of 10 people under age 30 said they used drugs in 1988, compared with two out of 10 in 1984 _ The proportion of women who said they examine their breasts at least once a month for signs of cancer rose to 51 percent, up from 37 percent five years earlier The telephone survey of 1,250 randomly selected adults was conducted last Nov. 9-23. Results had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<TEXT>
 A federal jury convicted 12 people Tuesday on charges they operated an interstate drug ring that called itself `` The Company.'' The trial lasted 16 months. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury found all the defendants in the case guilty of 65 of the 71 counts against them. Members of the ring were accused of making and selling methamphetamines and operating a marijuana plantation and other drug operations in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. They allegedly distributed the drugs from northern Califorian through western <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and south to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, the ringleader of the cartel based in nearby <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, was convicted on all 15 counts. <PERSON> Rupley </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnenfant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dwain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> were found guilty of conducting a continuing criminal enterprise, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The jury acquitted the defendants on three counts, and said they could not agree on a verdict on three other charges after 10 days of deliberations. The defendants appeared undaunted by the trial's outcome, chatting with each other as the verdicts were read and chuckling as Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> mispronounced one defendant's name. <PERSON> Bonnenfant </PERSON> and another defendant winked and waved at girlfriends in the audience. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> ordered the jurors, who first entered the courtroom on Jan. 19, 1988, to return Wednesday afternoon for the trial's final phase. They will determine whether the defendants should forfeit about $ 2 million to $ 3 million worth of possessions seized during their arrests. Prosecutors hope to get the cars, weapons and other items to help defray the huge cost of trying the case, estimated at $ 8 million to $ 10 million. Twenty-four people originally were indicted in the case, but half were removed before it went to trial after pleading guilty to reduced charges in exchange for cooperating with the government. The charges against the defendants convicted Tuesday included manufacture, possession and possesion for sale of methamphetamines and marijuana; interstate transportation in aid of racketeering; wiretapping, and unlawful use of a firearm. Except for the continuing criminal enterprise charge, most of the counts carry a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison and some permit a maximum sentence of 20 years.

<HEAD>Group Formed to Find Commercial Uses for Superconductors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A university and two giant companies that are leaders in technology research have joined forces to try to beat <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in development of commercial uses for superconductors. The announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday said the consortium's goal is develop applications for the new technology. Superconductors are ceramic materials cooled to beyond minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit, at which point they can let electricity pass through them without resistance. In theory, superconductors could let energy be stored and sent without any loss of strength and more cheaply than is now possible. Potential uses include faster computers and more powerful batteries and motors. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are researching superconductors, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has the edge. The goal of the consortium is to make sure American firms, rather than those from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, have the advantage in commercial application of the research. `` This will be a consortium of open communication among the researchers involved,'' the three organizations said in a joint statement. `` The combining of their scientific knowledge and their knowledge of applications will benefit the nation.'' The new organization will be called the Consortium for Superconducting Electronics. Researchers will remain at their present locations but will share information. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said such an organization was needed if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted to avoid what occurred in laser and videotape technology. Both were created in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but were commercially exploited by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The consortium announced that research efforts will be concentrated in four areas, including signal distribution, high-temperature materials and technology, advanced devices and integrated circuits, and junctions. The consortium will focus on applying superconductor technology to high-speed microelectronic devices for use in computers, telecommunications and military systems, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. `` It is a model of how universities, government labs and industry have to cooperate in the future to address a number of issues,'' <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> Provost <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutch </PERSON> told the Times. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomory </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president for science and technology, told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that the consortium would seek $ 4 million to $ 6 million in financing from a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> research agency, most of which would go to MIT. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dynes </PERSON>, director of chemical physics research at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, told the Times that consortium organizers thought having big organizations involved would give the group weight to attract other members. `` I do n't regard this as the big guys banding together and wiping out the little guys as much as giving the little guys an ability to get in the same building as us,'' he said.

 A fire started accidentally by a plumber Tuesday destroyed a <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> home housing a large collection of works by famed furniture maker and craftsman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakashima </PERSON>, officials said. More than 100 pieces of woodwork and furniture by <PERSON> Nakashima </PERSON> were destroyed, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. <PERSON> Nakashima </PERSON>, 83, is considered by many to be the elder statesman of American crafts. Only two pieces of the collection, owned by Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Krosnick </PERSON>, survived. A picture frame and a boardroom table were on loan for an exhibit of <PERSON> Nakashima </PERSON>'s work at the American Craft Museum in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` It is a great loss _ for them and for us,'' <PERSON> Nakashima </PERSON> told the Times in an interview from his studio in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` Some of the pieces can be replaced, but many can not. They are precise pieces _ one of a kind, many of them.'' The blaze began about 11:20 a.m. when an acetylene torch being used by the plumber caught fire, said <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Musso </PERSON>. The plumber set the torch on the floor while he looked for something to extinguish the flames, and while he was gone the fire engulfed the basement and spread to the rest of the house, <PERSON> Musso </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Freda </PERSON> estimated damages to the home and its contents at about $ 1 million. The house was in a secluded, wooded area. Mrs. <PERSON> Krosnick </PERSON> and her housekeeper escaped without injury, officials said. The plumber was treated for minor burns to his hands and hair at a hospital and released.

 The first film by 26-year-old American director <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderbergh </PERSON>, `` sex, lies and videotape,'' won the Golden Palm award at the 42nd <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> film festival, and Americans took several other top awards. One of the low-budget movie's four stars, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Spader </PERSON>, won best actor during Tuesday night's ceremonies and <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> was chosen best actress for her performance in `` A Cry in the Dark,'' directed by <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schepisi </PERSON>. American <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarmusch </PERSON>'s `` Mystery Train,'' the tale of three characters connected by a ride on the same train, took the prize for best artistic contribution. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, whose latest film `` Old Gringo'' officially closed the 13-day festival, also won a special prize for lifetime contribution to cinema. `` Well, I guess it's all downhill from here,'' said <PERSON> Soderburgh </PERSON> as he accepted the festival's top prize. `` I do n't know what to say.'' West German director <PERSON> Wim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenders </PERSON>, president of the jury, presented the award to <PERSON> Soderbergh </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wenders </PERSON> said the movie, a surprise choice among the 22 entries, brought the jury `` an enormous joy and a great confidence in the future of cinema.'' The Jury's Special Prize went to two films: French director <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Blier </PERSON>'s `` Trop Belle Pour Toi'' -LRB- Too Beautiful for You -RRB- and Italian director <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tornatore </PERSON>'s `` Nuovo Cinema Paradiso'' -LRB- New Paradise Cinema -RRB-.

The film had been among those rumored for the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION>. Shot on a $ 1.2 million budget, `` sex, lies and videotape'' tells the story of a seemingly happily married, prosperous couple, whose lives are disrupted when a troubled friend returns to town, upsetting a carefully constructed system of lies and sexual betrayal. <PERSON> Spader </PERSON> portrayed the returning friend. Impotent, he videotapes interviews with women about their sex lies as a substitute for real intimacy. The movie, through well received, had not figured in rumors for the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Blier </PERSON>'s `` Trop Belle Pour Toi,'' starring <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Depardieu </PERSON>, tells the story of a garage owner who betrays his beautiful wife following a sudden, unexplained attraction for his less attractive temporary secretary. `` Nuovo Cinema Paradiso'' a French-Italian entry, focuses on the cinema and its demise. `` Old Gringo,'' directed by Argentine <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Puenzo </PERSON> and also starring <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, officially closed the 13-day festival. Both <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> received standing ovations from the audience at the Palais des Festivals. <PERSON> Booes </PERSON> could be heard from the audience when no one came forward to collect the best actress prize for <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>, who was in town only for the showing of her film on May 13.

<HEAD>Regulations Designed to Curb Worker Exposure to AIDS, Hepatitis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government says 5.3 million workers would be better protected from exposure to AIDS, hepatitis and other viruses under new regulations requiring all blood and bodily fluids to be handled as if they were known to be infected. The regulations, proposed Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, were applauded by two unions that represent health-care employees and other workers who would be affected, although one of the unions suggested some minor changes. `` We sincerely hope that the department lives up to its commitment to finalize the standard at the very latest by the end of the year,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to 4.7 million health-care workers, the government said the regulations would protect 600,000 people working in law enforcement, fire and rescue squads, corrections facilities, research laboratories, blood banks and the funeral industry. The regulations would require employers to study any procedures which could expose workers to blood or other potentially infectious materials, identify workers who perform such tasks, and take appropriate steps to reduce the risk of exposure, including a written infection control plan and use of protective clothing. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> estimated that the regulations would prevent about 10,000 infections and 200 deaths a year among health-care workers. They would replace general <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> safety requirements for handling and disposal of potentially contaminated items with measures designed to deal specifically with AIDS, hepatitis and other diseases carried by blood and bodily fluids. Preliminary <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> estimates put the average annual cost of complying with the regulations at $ 1,373 apiece for the approximately 600,000 workplaces affected, ranging from $ 32,875 for a hospital to $ 141 for funeral service establishments. A hospital industry group, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said its staff was reviewing the proposal and had no immediate comment. If unchanged after a period of public comment, the regulations would require: _ That all blood and certain bodily fluids be handled as if they were infected with the AIDS-producing human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, the hepatitis B virus and other blood-borne viruses _ A number of controls for disposal of potentially infectious materials, including leak-proof, puncture-resistant and clearly labeled containers for the disposal of needles and other potentially infectious materials _ Clear labeling and signs in areas where potentially infectious materials are handled or stored _ Employers to offer free hepatitis B vaccines to workers who on average are exposed to potentially infectious fluids once or more a month That represents a shift from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which during early consideration of the regulations opposed forcing employers to pay for the costly vaccine. _ Employers to provide, and employees subjected to possible exposure to infectious materials to wear, protective clothing One of labor's complaints was language allowing that provision to be ignored if donning protective clothing `` would interfere with the proper delivery of health care of public safety situations.'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barab </PERSON>, occupational safety and health director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Municipal Employees, said labor supported allowing workers to decide to proceed without protective clothing in life-threatening situations. But <PERSON> Barab </PERSON> said the language in the proposed regulations was too vague and did not specify whether such a decision should rest with an employee or employer. Labor's second concern was that the regulations did not contain language, often found in new <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> regulations, requiring employers to make engineering improvements to reduce potential hazards. Such improvements, which often include development of new machines and techniques of handling potentially hazardous marterials, are considered more foolproof than requiring protective clothing. A draft of the regulations released in January required improved engineering controls where possible. `` The proposal has been seriously weakened,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McEntee </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> estimated workplace exposure results in 6,000 to 7,400 hepatitis B infections each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, causing up to 400 hospitalizations and between 130 and 165 deaths. The agency said it did not have such estimates for HIV exposure, but said fewer workers were exposed to the AIDS-producing virus than were exposed to hepatitis.

 <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, serving life in prison for assassinating Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, was denied parole for the 10th time Tuesday despite saying he felt `` very remorseful'' about the slaying. The state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terms </ORGANIZATION> made its decision after deliberating for nearly an hour, saying <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> was unsuitable for parole and calling <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s 1968 murder one of the most shocking crimes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. `` You still constitute a danger to society,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairman of the three-member panel, told <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, who will be eligible for parole again in a year. In denying <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>'s release, the board cited his unstable social history and `` selective memory'' of the June 5, 1968 slaying and events leading to it. The board also told <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> they wanted him to complete a more extensive psychiatric evaluation. <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, 45, showed no visible reaction to the decision, but expressed his frustration at a news conference after the hearing. `` Oftentimes I feel like a dog at the dog races. When the race is on, he's always chasing the rabbit ... whatever I do is not enough,'' said <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, who called the panel's reasons for denying parole `` specious at best.'' During the four-hour hearing at the State Correctional Training Facility in this small community about 180 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> told the prison board he was sorry for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s death The senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was shot with a .22 - caliber pistol as he walked through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> shortly after winning the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democratic presidential `` I feel very sad, very sorry, very remorseful ... that a human life was taken,'' <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, dressed in prison-issue blue denim shirt and jeans, told the board. `` After 21 years ... I have become quite convinced that my act was very wrong, morally and humanly, toward <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and especially toward his family and his loved ones and his suporters. `` I realize the mistake of it and I wish from the bottom of my heart ... that this crime, this horrible event, never occurred. `` I feel 21 years of this type of prison has been plenty of punishment,'' he said. `` I wish I could reverse it and undo it but I ca n't.'' <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, a Jerusalem-born <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, was sentenced to death for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s murder but was spared the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> gas chamber after <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s death penalty law was overturned in 1972 by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. His sentence was changed to life in prison with possibility of parole, and <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> faced his first parole hearing in 1975. He is imprisoned at the State Correctional Training Facility. <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> last came before the board two years ago. At the time, the panel recommended he undergo extensive psychiatric evaluation, pursue vocational training, attend Alcoholics Anonymous sessions, remain free of disciplinary problems, earn an associate's degree and provide documentation of job offers. `` The American system of justice is going to let me go home in a coffin,'' an angry <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> said then. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> McKissack </PERSON>, asked that the hearing be postponed so <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> could complete the psychiatric evaluation, which began in March. <PERSON> McKissack </PERSON>, who engaged in frequent shouting matches with board members, argued they should disqualify themselves as prejudiced against <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> because they had taken part in a previous hearing. The board, however, denied his requests to postpone the hearing and disqualify themselves. <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, who cried out, `` I did it for my country'' seconds after the shooting, told television interviewer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> in February that he acted not `` out of personal malice towards the man but out of concern for other people.'' He compared his act to a Jew killing <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> apparently was angered after <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a staunch supporter of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, repeated his proposal that 50 Phantom jets be shipped to the Jewish state. During the interview, <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> repeatedly apologized for the killing.

 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Cathedral, the `` great church for national purposes'' that <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> L'Enfant </PERSON> dreamed of as part of his plan for the nation's capital, is at last nearing completion. Signaling the beginning of the final phase of construction, a flatbed truck pulled up in front of the 14th century Gothic-style structure Tuesday with one last load of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> limestone. The first load was delivered in 1910. The ceremonial placing of the final stone is scheduled for Sept. 29, 1990 - 83 years to the day from the laying of the cornerstone in 1907. But most of the heavy work will have been completed by this fall, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Feller </PERSON>, canon clerk of the works, or head of construction for the cathedral. `` This is a great day,'' said the Rt. Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Episcopal </PERSON> bishop of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It's been a labor of love,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleland </PERSON>, master mason, who has worked on the project since 1953. L'Enfant, the man commissioned by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> to lay out the capital on the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, included the church in his plans, but no steps were taken to build it until a group of citizens took up the project in the 1890s. Work has continued with few interruptions since 1907. Construction was halted during World War I and World War II and because of a shortage of funds in the 1970s. But 83 years is by no means a long time for building such an edifice, said the Rev. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, communications director at the cathedral. `` This is about middle range for building a cathedral,'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said. `` A shorty might take 50 or 60 years. Some of them go 150 years or more without having been finished.'' `` A modern building, you put up a steel frame and put things around it, but that's not the way this was built,'' he said. `` This was built physically in the same manner that they were built in the Middle Ages.'' That is, he said, `` stone on stone.'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Segreti </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Segreti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tepper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architects </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> firm overseeing the job, said, `` There's quite a difference working on this project and on a specification office building downtown. This type of construction you do n't see in this day and age.'' The first section, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION>, was completed in 1912; the central tower was finished in 1964, and the nave was ready for the nation's bicentennial in 1976. The cathedral was the setting for the funeral of President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> in 1969 and a national memorial service for President <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> in 1972. It is the final resting place of <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> preached his last Sunday sermon there, three days before he was murdered. Each year, about 350,000 people visit the unfinished house of worship, the sixth largest cathedral in the world. It is a tenth of a mile long and 289 feet wide at its widest point. The stones from <ORGANIZATION> Bybee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, which has supplied the cathedral for about 10 years, weigh from 150 to 450 pounds. There were other suppliers before <PERSON> Bybee </PERSON>, but all the limestone has come from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.

The reports by the state television and radio networks that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was in `` exceptional condition'' for his age, despite the surgery on Tuesday to stop intestinal bleeding, appeared aimed at reassuring Iranians the revolutionary patriarch was still at the helm. `` I would like to inform listeners and viewers that his eminence ... is perhaps one of history's exceptions in his physical structure and state of health,'' the chief surgeon, Dr. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arefi </PERSON>, declared. That may have comforted <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s followers. But it was also a reminder of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s mortality and emphasized that the question of who will rule <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the post-Khomeini era is wide open. On March 28, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> dumped his designated successor, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein-Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, in one of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s biggest political upheavals since the 1979 Islamic revolution ended 2,400 years of monarchy. Political and religious leaders are grappling with changing the revolutionary constitution to eliminate what <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> calls `` flaws and imperfections'' and settle the leadership question. The recommendations of the 20-man <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> appointed will go before voters in a referendum in mid-August _ the same time Iranians vote for a new president. Since <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> abruptly accepted a cease-fire in the 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> last summer, it has been gripped by political uncertainty. Anti-Western revolutionary radicals led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, who favor tight control of the economy, are locked in a power struggle with those seeking more free enterprise and links with the West. In March, <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> was forced to resign after criticizing <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s policies and questioning what the revolution had achieved in its first decade. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>'s resignation followed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s sharp swing back to fundamentalist radicalism. In February, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered Moslems to seek out and kill British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for his novel, `` The Satanic Verses,'' charging it blasphemes Islam. The death call brought widespead Western condemnation of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, smothering moves toward liberalization and efforts by Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and others to end <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s self-imposed isolation. The radical resurgence intensified a wave of executions of political dissidents and purges. The power struggle is likely to intensify. `` <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>'s resignation ... raises the question of how far <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is prepared to go in his current drive to root out revisionism,'' commented <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, an analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> weekly. `` It may be that the ayatollah is feeling his mortality and is trying, like Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, to ensure the future of his revolution after his death by turning the radicals loose while he is still alive,'' Snow said. The uncertainty is compounded by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s tactic of constantly switching support for one faction or another so none becomes too powerful. Against this backdrop, the deliberations of the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will have a far-reaching impact on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s future. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the only declared presidential candidate so far, wants to widen the powers of the office and scrap the premiership to eliminate the competing power centers that have paralyzed decisions on the economy and social reform. The hardliners favor a presidency which is largely ceremonial, with power centralized in the prime minister. The debate is heating up, although the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Times daily noted Monday that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s campaign `` seems to be getting the nod from the majority'' of the committee. All indications are that in the absence of any leader with <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s spiritual authority as vice-regent of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, there will be a tilt toward installing a collective leadership after he dies. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, as well as <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, whose political ambitions are starting to show, will likely be on that leadership council. If, despite the radicals' strength, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> can change the constitution his way and win the presidency, he would be expected to make profound changes in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s power structure. Current President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, whose second four-year term expires in September, has asserted that concentrating power in the presidency will not lead to a dictatorship and noted: `` You ca n't run a country ... if there is too much dispersion of power.

<HEAD>NRC To Study Concerns About Low-Power Nuclear Operation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nuclear power plants are n't designed for low-power operation and could be strained by running at lower levels, a panel of scientists warns. The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its staff will review concerns by <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Reactor Safeguards about low-power operation. The panel counsels the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> on potential industry hazards. As a safety precaution, nuclear power plants normally operate at low power, or 5 percent of generating capacity, before they are permitted to increase operation and begin generating electricity. In a May 11 letter to <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON>, the panel said it has no evidence that extended low-power operation is unsafe. But it said it knows of `` instances in which operation at low flow has produced excessive wear in check valves and in which operation at low power has produced excessive vibration in a feedwater pump not designed for extended operation at low flow. `` Our principal concern stems from the memory that the operators of the Chernobyl plant, Unit 4, were unaware of the dangers of operation at low power, whereas a careful analysis would have convinced them that this was undesirable,'' the panel said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> plant at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> was operating at low power when an April 1986 accident killed at least 31 people and released a radioactive cloud that spread over a wide area. Eleven American nuclear power plants now have construction permits. Among the closest to receiving low-power licenses are <LOCATION> Limerick </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, Comanche Peak in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Watts Bar in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Low-power testing can take several months, `` but it's not a standard time period. It's a case-by-case thing,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopeck </PERSON>. A utility official recently said he was `` uneasy'' about operating at 5 percent power, `` although he did not believe there was anything unsafe about it,'' the committee said in its report. The panel did not disclose the name of the official, or of plants where problems occurred. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, a nuclear safety engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in an interview Tuesday that he was familiar with the low-power problem. The <ORGANIZATION> UCS </ORGANIZATION> is a private, non-profit group which has been critical of some nuclear power plants. `` I've certainly heard of some of the types of problems the letter mentions, particularly when you take the large centrifugal pumps cooled by water flowing through them,'' <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> said. When there is a slower flow through the system, the pumps and some other parts `` do n't get cooled as well,'' he said. But <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> said he was miffed at the reference to <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> because the reactor was unstable at low power to the point that `` I do n't know of a similar parallel in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

The fire broke out around 2:45 p.m., said the bazaar's building manager, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>. May said blaze started at the top of a second-floor stairwell and that he tried to put it out with a fire extinguisher but it was out of control. The building was full of employees and shoppers when the fire broke out, but was speedily evacuated, May said. The bazaar housed 30 shops, including two wholesale produce markets, said May, declaring the building a total loss. The fire's cause was unknown, and arson investigators were called in.

 Federal investigators blame <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for an accident that ripped open an airliner fuselage 24,000 feet over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> but they say lax inspection of aging 737s was an `` industry-wide deficiency.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, ending a 13-month investigation Tuesday, blamed the accident on failure of island-hopping <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON>'s maintenance program to detect broken bonds and fatigue damage in the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737's outer skin. The board voted 4-1 to lay primary blame on the airline and said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> failures contributed to the April 28, 1988, accident that hurled the plane's chief flight attendant out of the airliner to her death. With one engine out and its passenger section exposed to the sky, the plane landed on the island of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> with 89 passengers and five other crew members. The independent safety board said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> failed to issue sufficient orders to correct problems with the aging 737 fleet and did n't adequately monitor <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON>'s maintenance program before the incident. <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON>'s president, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, took exception to the board's conclusion, saying multiple cracking found around rivets in the fuselage skin was undetectable prior to the accident. He said the airline had followed all <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> safety orders. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the accident was <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>'s first in four decades, and the airline has voluntarily scrapped three old 737s and decreased the average age of its fleet from 15 years to 10. The average age of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliners approaches 13 years. The board said <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON>'s maintenance program failed to detect disbonding and fatigue in fuselage skin joints, including numerous cracks around rivets that hold fuselage pieces together. The 19-year-old airliner had been flying between 12 and 18 flights a day in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s warm, humid climate, investigators said. But the board noted that similar fatigue problems were found as early as 1974 in other 737s, resulting in service orders from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directives. The board indicated that many airlines were not making required inspections. `` Reports of fleet-wide cracks received by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> accident indicate that a similar lack of critical attention to lap joint inspection and fatigue cracks detection was an industry-wide deficiency,'' it said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> cited the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident last week when it issued broad orders for mandatory replacements on aging <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s, 737s and 747s. Previously, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> generally required replacements only if regular inspections detected excessive wear. Safety board member <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> called for an examination into new <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> orders that are based on proposals from an aviation industry task force. `` I have sensed generally that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is moving in a competent manner in tying to deal with the aging aircraft problem,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. `` But I'm always suspicious of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> orders -RRB- that are drafted by the industry, and we need to take a good careful look at them.'' Board member <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> dissented from the board's vote on a `` probable cause'' for the accident. He proposed wording that would not have laid primary blame on the airline, saying the fact that cracks went undetected was `` a system problem'' involving the industry, the government and the carrier. The board rejected a conclusion proposed by its staff that would have sharply criticized the cockpit crew of Aloha Flight 243 for procedures used in landing the heavily damaged plane. Staff investigators said the speed of the landing threatened to split apart the plane. Board members said they would include cautions about such landing conditions in the full report to be released in several weeks, but wanted to include balancing comment about the heroics of the pilots and flight attendants. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> has no authority to impose penalties and can only make recommendations to government agencies, transportation companies and others.

 When a farmer cuts down his wood lot and uses the money for a trip to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, he knows he's used up an asset. When <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> cuts down its tropical timber and consumes the proceeds, that counts as national income. `` Our current measures of economic success are misleading,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON>, director of research for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. `` A country could exhaust its mineral resources, cut down its forests, erode its soils, pollute its aquifers, and hunt its wildlife and fisheries to extinction but measured income would not be affected,'' said <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON>. `` No business would last very long selling off its assets to meet the current payroll,'' he pointed out, `` but many countries are doing just that behind a screen of misleading statistics.'' The institute is a private study group funded by foundations, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, government agencies, corporations and individuals. <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> and four co-authors have written `` Wasting Assets: Natural Resources in the National Income Accounts,'' which concentrates on <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> is now working on figures for <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Officially, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s production grew by 7 percent a year between 1970 and 1984. <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> says that when loss of forests, soil and oil is taken into account, that figure falls to 4 percent. According to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s population is growing at a rate of more than 2 percent a year, so the average citizen would see little improvement in living standards. Conditions have grown worse since 1984 with the drop in the price of oil, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s major export. The bank calculates that in 1987 the average <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> earned $ 450, down from $ 500 the year before. <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> wants to make it clear that he is not just quarrelling with other statisticians. The failure to take account of disappearing resources also distorts calculations about the growth of assets on which governments lay their plans for the future, he said. `` It's a kind of deficit financing, too important to be left to statisticians,'' he added in an interview. `` This is like the lawyer in the depression who told his wife at dinner that he'd had a pretty good day _ no clients, but he managed to sell his desk.'' <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> said he had presented his work to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which is revising its method of calculating a country's growth. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> method is the standard method in use. He reported that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials were sympathetic but do not have the money to make as complete a revision as he's seeking. <PERSON> Repetto </PERSON> suggested that the cost would not be high, pointing out that he did the present study in six months with the help of four graduate students. The calculations need not be made for all countries, only those where natural resources are a major part of total resources, he said. `` That would have been true of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1850,'' he explained. `` Now our big resource is a skilled and educated population. We maintain our forest and soil, so taking depletion of natural resources into account would not change our figures that much, or the figures of other highly developed countries.''

<TEXT>
 The picturesque southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> resort town of <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> reverberated with eerie squeals, squawks and beeps last weekend. It was n't the sound of waterfowl or other wildlife. It was part of a paging system used by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to alert reporters on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> watch of impending presidential activities. An army of nearly 500 reporters, both American and French, overtook <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vacation home for his meeting with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. Now that the weather has turned warmer, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to return quite frequently to his family house on a point jutting into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. During his most recent visit, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> press corps set up work quarters at a Lithuanian Franciscan monastery in town and rented electronic pagers from the White House. With a single phone call, White House official <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanca </PERSON> could activate all the voice-alert pagers at once to let news people who had strayed from the monastery know an event was about to take place. Then they would all converge at the monastery at once. And that always meant a chaotic arrival scene since few journalists hung around the monastery when nothing was going on. Every time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would leave his compound _ to jog, to play golf, to go to a restaurant _ there would be an announcement over the paging system. Since reporters almost outnumbered locals in town, each time the pagers went off simultaneously, there was an enormous cacophony throughout town. Entire restaurants would erupt in the strange noise. Tourists would pause on the sidewalk and gawk. Hotel lobbies would buzz with the crackling announcements. One time, the pagers even went off _ dozens of them at once _ in the middle of a press briefing at the monastery by press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who first looked perplexed, then bemused.

<HEAD>Bush Plans to Expand Commercial Bank Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will try to jump start last year's failed campaign by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to expand commercial bank powers, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official says. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary for finance, told a financial services lobby group Tuesday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, like the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration before it, believes banks can compete against their foreign competitors only by offering currently forbidden services, such as securities underwriting. <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON>'s speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was the first substantive statement on the subject by a senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official. And in later remarks to reporters, <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> said he hoped the restructuring could be addressed next year once <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to rescue the savings and loan industry is passed. <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON>, the top administration policymaker for banking and financial issues, noted that banks in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are permitted to underwrite, buy and sell securities, offer insurance, develop real estate and invest in industrial companies. Partly as a result of that, foreign banks have outgrown <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> institutions, he said, noting that in 1970 seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks ranked among the world's largest. That share slipped to three in 1980 and none currently, he said. `` Permitting ... a broad array of financial services and products ... can only help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms stem the loss of customers to less regulated foreign firms,'' he said. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks have been barred from securities underwriting since 1933, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the Glass-Steagall Act separating commercial and investment banking. Opponents of repealing Glass-Steagall argue that investment banking is too risky for institutions with federally insured deposits. But <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> said: `` Securities underwriting is no more risky _ and probably less risky _ than commercial lending.'' He did not specify exactly how the administration would extend new powers to banks, but he spoke favorably of a bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last year. Similar legislation foundered in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, caught in a jurisdictional dispute between two committee chairmen. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, versions of which have been reintroduced this year in both chambers of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, permitted bank holding companies, through subsidiaries and with certain safeguards, to underwrite corporate bonds and most other securities except corporate stock. In remarks to reporters following his speech, <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> said he believed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would pause this year after passing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s savings and loan plan and then tackle proposals for restructuring of the financial system next year The legislation's prospects could be hurt because some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are blaming ill-advised deregulation for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry's problems. But, <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> said, `` it is ... clear that the model of the thrift industry in the early 1980s _ with its lack of private, up-front capital and ill-supervised reform _ is not the model to be followed as we move forward.''

<HEAD>Rain Eases Drought, No Help For Wheat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rain has helped take the edge off persistent drought conditions in the central and southern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and has slowed field work in the eastern Corn Belt and the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> region, say government crop watchers. But despite the rain, the outlook for winter wheat in much of the plains continues to be poor. Harvest is under way in several states, including <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, lawmakers are putting together a 1989 version of last year's huge $ 3.9 billion drought aid package. Although no firm cost estimate has been tied to the current package, it would contain many of the financial aid features of last year's measure. The latest report by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> said corn planting nationally was 84 percent complete by the end of the May 15-21 survey week, lagging the normal pace by only two percentage points. However, in the wetter areas of the eastern Corn Belt, planting of the new crop lagged far behind. `` Planting was complete in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and nearly complete in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>,'' the report said. But in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where 85 percent of the corn acreage is usually planted by now, only 24 percent was seeded, the report said. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 19 percent of the corn was planted by May 21, compared with 62 percent in normal years. The weather facility, operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> departments, said the 1989 soybean crop was about 39 percent planted, only two percentage points behind normal. However, plantings lagged sharply in some areas, including <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where only 6 percent of the estimated soybean acreage had been planted, compared with a normal 56 percent. Cotton plantings, at 60 percent, were nine points behind the usual rate. Although planting was complete in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, it lagged in the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and Southeast. A related report by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 drought task force headed by Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON> said that `` timely rains in the Corn Belt are promoting rapid germination and establishment of this year's crop.'' But the report added that the impact of recent rain in winter wheat areas will depend, in part, on future weather. `` If another -LRB- weather -RRB- front brings more rain as predicted, moderate improvement in crop conditions could occur,'' the task force said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> calls for `` moderate to heavy rain in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> in the next 5 to 10 days,'' it added. `` The outlook through mid-June still calls for cool, wet weather in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and warm, dry weather from the eastern <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> into the central Corn Belt.'' A new 30 - and 90-day weather outlook is scheduled to be issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> next week Meanwhile, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> agreed Tuesday to push through a broad package of assistance this week for farmers suffering crop losses from continuing drought. The committee, under the agreement worked out by Democrats and Republicans, will act on the legislation at a session Thursday. The relief package will be brought before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> at an undetermined date after lawmakers return from a Memorial Day recess. `` I think the chances that a bill will be passed and signed into law by the president ... have dramatically improved,'' Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., said after the meeting of committee leaders, including the panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> The aid package will mirror relief programs enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year to aid producers in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. In general, federal payments would be made to farmers who suffer losses of more than 35 percent on their crops. The relief would be available for all crops _ not just specific hard-hit ones like wheat _ because of damages from drought, freezing temperatures, hail, excessive moisture and other problems, according to <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, a spokesman for Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., chairman of the Agriculture subcomittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains Lawmakers are considering the new drought package because the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said the 1989 winter wheat crop does n't qualify for any of the $ 3.9 billion in assistance approved in 1988 A group of senators last week introduced drought relief legislation to extend last year's assistance programs to the winter wheat crop. Similar proposals had been offered in the House. But <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee leaders decided to go with a `` generic bill'' as a way of broadening support as well as ensuring that adequate aid is available to spring-planted crops if the drought worsens or spreads to other regions. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s current estimate, the 1989 winter wheat harvest may hit an 11-year low of 1.43 billion bushels, including a drop of more than one-third in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, traditionally the nation's leading producer Under last year's relief program, farmers received federal payments covering 65 percent of income lost from the crop damages exceeding 35 percent, and 90 percent of income lost from damages to that portion of the crop exceeding 75 percent losses. <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said a similar formula is planned in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill although that could be changed later. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said recent crop estimates by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> made it clear that the costs of any drought relief program should n't pose a budget problem. The federal wheat subsidy program is expected to cost much less this year because of higher market prices stemming from the drought.

 A human guinea pig says she made friends with mice and learned some English during her 130 days in an underground cave to help researchers study the effects of isolation. <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON> <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> of <PERSON> Ancona </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, smiled and waved at reporters and well-wishers as she emerged Tuesday afternoon from Lost Cave, ending an experiment that began on Jan. 13. Would she do it again? `` Sure,'' said the 27-year-old interior decorator, who volunteered for the experiment. Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>, who lost 17 pounds during her solitude and now weighs 90 pounds, appeared healthy and happy as she answered questions from reporters. Although she had no contact with humans, except through computers, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> said she did n't feel lonely during the experiment and adopted two cave mice as pets. She named them <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicoleta </PERSON>. `` There was some difficulty in communicating with the mice,'' she said through an interpreter. `` But I was always right.'' The experiment was designed to resemble interplanetary travel. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ancona </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> universities took part in the experiment. Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>'s only contact with the outside world was through computer terminals linked between her 10-foot-square plastic-enclosed underground habitat and the researchers' house trailer above the cave. She had no clocks, her menstrual cycle stopped, and she lost track of how many days had passed. When she was told Monday the experiment was almost over, she thought she had been in the cave about 80 days. She tended to sleep about 10 hours and stay awake 20 to 25 hours. Three video cameras and microphones monitored Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> constantly. Only the bathroom was out of sight of cameras. She said she did n't mind the lack of privacy. `` I rarely thought about it,'' she said. `` Sometimes I felt it was a strong presence, but generally I was not bothered by that.'' When Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> climbed out of the cave into the midday sun, she appeared disoriented for a few seconds. But she quickly donned sunglasses handed to her, then grinned and waved at the 60 onlookers. At the news conference, she said she thinks her isolation will make her more thoughtful, outgoing and decisive. And she said her outlook has improved. `` I consider myself more important,'' she said. `` I love myself more and consequently I can love people and the world more.'' Scientists plan to examine her intensively during the next few months to find out if her isolation affected her mentally and physically. For example, project coordinator <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> _ who spent 210 days in a cave two years ago _ believes the isolation will help Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>'s concentration. A NASA-affiliated research team at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> plans to test that Monday by monitoring Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>'s brain waves while she solves computer-generated problems. Other scientists will be drawing blood and checking her immune system, bones, muscles and coordination. Some believe her immune system was suppressed, her bones lost calcium and her muscles weakened. But <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> said he thinks Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> might surprise researchers. He said she kept her strength and flexibility by doing calisthenics and judo and maintained her poise by keeping busy by reading and decorating her living area. The researchers chose Lost Cave because it maintains a constant climate of 74 degrees and 99 percent humidity and is relatively close to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, home to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and many researchers. Before the experiment began, Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> said she was taking English textbooks with her and would answer questions in English. She did understand simple questions and was able to answer in short English phrases, but she did n't master the language in 130 days. `` When she was down there, she had English and Spanish books to learn,'' said translator <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraschini </PERSON>. `` But the English one was difficult and boring, so she switched to the Spanish one, which was funny.''

<HEAD>Equipment Makers Say Sharp Reduction of Auto Pollution is Possible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The companies that make motor vehicle anti-pollution equipment predict they can meet the tough emissions standards proposed in a clean air bill favored by environmentalists but denounced as too extreme by the auto industry. Strongly disagreeing with auto industry witnesses, the <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Tuesday that its companies could produce pollution control equipment that would meet the proposed standards for 100,000 miles of driving each vehicle. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertlesen </PERSON>, executive director of the group, said the association based its assessment on continuing progress in developing better anti-pollution equipment, more advanced engine controls and continued reduction of lead contamination in unleaded fuel. `` The most serious challenge to meeting these more stringent emission standards is maintaining emission control performance during the useful life of the vehicle under real world conditions,'' the association said. `` We believe the engineering challenges can be resolved.'' At a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> health subcommittee, the association strongly endorsed emission testing programs to ensure that owners keep their vehicles properly tuned. <PERSON> Bertlesen </PERSON> testified at the first hearing on legislation by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., subcommittee chairman, to reduce air pollution at a time that virtually every <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city has failed to meet federal air quality standards While reducing pollution from motor vehicles is a major part of the bill, it also attempts to cut emissions from industrial sources and consumer products. But the debate over auto, truck and bus emissions standards is likely to determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ as happened last year _ lets a clean air bill die in a legislative stalemate. The <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, representing the `` Big Three'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers, told <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s panel the best way to reduce pollution from motor vehicles is by waiting for the normal phase-out of older cars still on the road. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the association, said less than half the vehicles now in use were built under the latest emissions standards. He blamed the older vehicles for nearly 90 percent of the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions, and more than 7 percent of the nitrogen oxides _ major pollutants from motor vehicles. He predicted that a further tightening of emission requirements would have `` a minimal air quality benefit compared to vehicle fleet turnover.'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Dana </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Importers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, representing major manufacturers of foreign cars, called <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s bill `` extreme and unreasonable'' and said the legislation presents a challenge that is `` simply unattainable.'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s bill would toughen tailpipe emission standards for hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides; set new requirements to reduce hydrocarbon pollution from the evaporation of gasoline at the pump and on the road; and require that emission controls last the full useful life of an automobile. The tailpipe standards would kick in for passenger cars beginning in the 1992 model year and become even tougher in the 2000 model year. An alternative bill, sponsored by nine <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members as a compromise between the auto industry and the environmentalists, would toughen current standards but not nearly as much as the <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> bill. The nine lawmakers would use the best available technology in requiring new emissions requirements starting in 1993, while the <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> measure aims to force automakers to develop new anti-pollution technology. Backing <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s position were environmental groups including the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and public officials representing state and county governments, including <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> representing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Mobile sources account for half, or more, of the air pollutants that threaten public health in our cities, and we simply must demand more of the motor vehicle manufacturers,'' she said. `` We need automobiles that drive us where we want to go, without driving us to environmental destruction,'' she said.

 More than 300 federal prisoners at a privately operated detention center refused to return to their cells to protest living conditions and food quality, authorities said. Law enforcement officers from 12 federal, state and local agencies were dispatched to the <ORGANIZATION> Eden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to quell the disturbance, officials said. The inmates were upset with prison conditions and food and refused to return to their dormitories, Concho County Sheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiveash </PERSON> said. He said a few mattresses were burned, but the protest was generally non-violent. The disturbance was reported shortly after 5 p.m., and appeared to involve most of the 330 inmates. By 11:30 p.m., fewer than 100 inmates remained in the yard. `` We will not take any steps. We will let them sit in the yard and wait,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyskens </PERSON>, a federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> officer based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, said of those inmates. `` I'm certain this will be resolved without force.'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnes </PERSON>, the owner of the detention center, denied that inmates burned mattresses. `` Nothing was burned,'' <PERSON> Burnes </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He then said he did n't have time to talk and hung up. Some civilian employees who had locked themselves inside were escorted out. A prison official who refused to identify herself said no one was in immediate danger. A fire in December caused more than $ 1 million in damage to the prison. The detention center closed for 35 days afterward until a new 60,000-square-foot addition could be built. Before the fire, the prison held 200 prisoners. The addition was designed to hold 365 inmates, but the number of inmates was not immediately known. Most of the prisoners the government has contracted with the facility to hold are illegal aliens who are serving sentences of 18 months or fewer for federal crimes, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The 203 prisoners at the detention center at the time of the fire had to be transferred to other centers in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The section destroyed by fire is being renovated and, when it is completed, the prison will hold 500. In July 1987, prisoners at the facility signed a letter complaining of violations of civil rights, <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> standards and sanitation. Prisoners said in the letter that they were offered real meat only once a week. They later complained of a lack of recreation facilities. A federal prison inspector recommended improvements in prison employee training. <PERSON> Burnes </PERSON> later in 1987 said he planned to change the prison population makeup from illegal aliens to white-collar, short-term federal prisoners.

 Efforts to halt the rising number of adolescent pregnancies in Southern states should be aimed at boys as well as young girls, said a plan released today. `` Every three minutes, a girl aged 10-17 gives birth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said the study. `` That stark fact spells tragedy for mother, father and child, and it costs our communities enormously in both human and economic terms. `` Southern communities are most affected because, as a region, we have the highest rates of adolescent pregnancy and childbearing,'' it said. `` Prevention is our best hope of ending this epidemic and helping our children grow up before they have children of their own.'' The plan was compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> on Infant Mortality, in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. The 17 southern states in the study had a higher rate of adolescent pregnancy than the rest of the country, the report noted. In 1985, 47 percent of the nation's 178,000 births to girls under age 17 occurred in 17 southern states, even though only 37 percent of girls under 17 live in the South. Among girls under 17 with second or higher order births that year, 49 percent were in the South. In the southern states, the public costs of teenage childbearing, in the form of food, welfare and medical assistance, totaled $ 3.58 billion in fiscal 1987, the report said. `` When our children have children, we all lose,'' said <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, co-chairman of the group that produced the report. `` Adolescent parents and their babies face hardships they are not prepared for _ risks of poor health, incomplete educations, poverty and welfare dependency. `` The rest of us lose them, their talents, abilities and leadership, and we pay a lot more to treat the problem than we would to prevent it,'' he said. Males should be included in all pregnancy prevention programs because focusing solely on females `` ignores half the problem,'' the report said. It recommended promotion of education and life skills at the earliest possible age through state and federal spending on early childhood education programs and the expansion of Head Start. It also called for encouraging children to complete high school, including taking `` family life'' courses designed by parents and local school boards. In addition, the report called for better job prospects and more community involvement for adolescents, improved health care for young people, and help for parents. `` As the primary shapers of their children, parents mold the value system of their children and this value system frames the way in which these children view early sexual involvement and early parenthood,'' the report said. The 17 states are <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>GAO Said To Urge Review of Choices For New Military Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> misled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year about key aspects of its plan for building new military reactors in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in a report prepared for publication today. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was scheduled to detail its charges at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> nuclear facilities subcommittee, which is examining the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's plans for modernizing the nuclear weapons complex. The administration is pushing for financing to start development of one new reactor at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Site </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and another at the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. The reactors, estimated to cost a total of about $ 7.5 billion, would produce tritium, a radioactive gas needed in the production of nuclear warheads. The government's only existing tritium-producing reactors, also situated at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, have been shut down since last spring for safety reasons. They are scheduled to resume operation next year, but their reliability is in doubt. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, in a condensed preliminary draft of its study on the reactor plan, said `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was misinformed'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on how long it would take to get the new <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors running, according to a congressional source who saw the draft. The source asked not to be identified. The draft report said the department `` needs to reconsider'' its decision, announced last summer, to put the new reactors in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. It also said the projects' cost accounting was not clear. One alternative to these sites is the Hanford Nuclear Reservation near <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 1 plant could be converted to tritium production. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> estimated this would cost about two-thirds as much as building new reactors from scratch elsewhere, and production could be started much earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor at <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> could be put into operation in about 10 years, but the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said it would take 13 -LCB- years, the source said. The technology for this type of reactor is not yet fully developed. The new <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> facility would be a heavy water reactor, a technology already in use. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said it would take about 12 -LCB- years to get this plant running, while the department has estimated 10 years. The Hanford reactor, which was built for commercial use but abandoned because of a regional power surplus, could be converted to military use within about seven years, the report said. Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said last month that while it is economically and technically feasible to convert the Hanford plant to tritium production, that approach is a `` political nightmare'' that he did not want to pursue. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said one of the main sticking points with converting the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> plant is whether it would violate the letter or spirit of the nuclear non-proliferation agreement. He said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had reviewed that question and concluded that, strictly speaking, conversion would not violate the treaty. `` The question is, who wants to get into the game of deciding whether or not you should go forward and propose essentially a commercial reactor generating nuclear material?'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. Two prominent scientists, in testimony before the nuclear facilities panel Tuesday, said it would be wasteful and premature for the administration to move ahead now with construction of new military reactors, regardless of their location. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, a former designer of atomic weapons, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathjens </PERSON>, a former chief scientist in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has more than enough tritium to sustain its nuclear arsenal for several years.

 A convicted murderer was executed by injection early Wednesday for the 1981 slaying of a woman who was abducted and raped after her car broke down on a freeway. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, whose final appeal was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> late Tuesday, was executed at 12:25 a.m. at the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>' Walls Unit here. He gave no final statement. He coughed five times after the injection was made about 12:15 a.m. and groaned twice. His brother-in-law, two friends and his attorney, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zellars </PERSON>, were among the witnesses. The nation's highest court denied him a stay by a 5-4 vote without comment. The 40-year-old <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> electrician was the 31st <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> convict and the 110th in the nation executed since the 1976 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allowing states to resume capital punishment. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> was convicted in the slaying of <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 18, who was abducted as she was returning home from a New Year's Eve party on Jan. 1, 1981. According to trial testimony, <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> and two other men abducted the woman. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> raped her, then held her legs down while <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Paster </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> strangled her with an electrical cord. <PERSON> Paster </PERSON> then drove a nail up the woman's nose to make certain she was dead, said the man who prosecuted the case. `` The death penalty was made for people like <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> to protect society from people like him and from people like <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Paster </PERSON>,'' said prosecutor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambright </PERSON>. `` It was the cold-bloodedness of the acts.'' <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> insisted he was in another room when the woman was slain. `` I knew what was going on,'' he said in a death row interview. `` I just could n't do anything about it.'' <PERSON> Paster </PERSON>, awaiting death for another slaying, received a life sentence for the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> killing. Last month, he was caught with another death row inmate in an unsuccessful escape attempt. <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>, who testified for the state, received a 35-year prison sentence. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> was in prison serving five years for burglary when he was charged with the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> slaying. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paster </PERSON> and <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> also were linked to a 1980 murder-for-hire in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and the rape and stabbing of a woman. Attorneys for <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> raised nine issues in their appeal, including objections to jury selection, <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>'s competence to stand trial and ineffective legal assistance. There also was no evidence presented at his trial to show <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> was a continued threat to society, according to <PERSON> Zellars </PERSON>. State attorneys called the appeal arguments frivolous.

 The popularity of unregulated shooting sports like target practice in open fields is n't a good reason to permit people to buy semiautomatic assault-style weapons, a law enforcement official contends. `` In order to save lives, if we must sacrifice someone's minor recreational endeavor in order to do that, I think that's a sacrifice we can make in this country,'' said <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Behan </PERSON>, the president of Police Executive Research Forum. `` I think lives are far more important,'' <PERSON> Behan </PERSON> said Tuesday as he helped launch a new ad campaign _ sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ calling for a ban on semiautomatic assault-style firearms. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration imposed a temporary ban on imports of such weapons in March, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week called for a permanent ban on imports that are n't intended for sporting use. He also called for a ban on ammunition magazines with more than 15 rounds. The actions surprised the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a lifetime <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> member, said earlier this year he opposed limits on the weapons. His wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> said they should be banned. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> is studying whether the weapons are used for sports, a study that focuses on regulations on hunting and target competitions. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Conover </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist, contended that `` plinking,'' or target practice in open fields, is a legitimate sport, even if those who engage in it do n't participate in formal competitions. A public outcry for limits on the weapons erupted after a man armed with a semiautomatic version of an AK-47 opened fire in January on a schoolyard in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, killing five children. The guns have also been widely used in drug-related shootings. <PERSON> Behan </PERSON> said the proliferation of semiautomatic assault-style weapons, `` like the proliferation of handguns, it's now becoming a national disgrace.'' Crimes involving assault-style weapons have risen 78 percent in the past two years, he said. `` The carnage is increasing,'' he said as he called for a ban on domestically produced versions of the weapons as well as imported ones, saying that two-thirds of the assault-style firearms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are made in this country. The Atlanta Constitution reported Sunday that an assault-style gun is 20 times more likely to be used in crime than a conventional firearm. While only 1 million of the 200 million privately owned guns in the country are assault-style weapons, they were used in one of every 10 crimes that resulted in a firearms trace last year, the paper reported. <PERSON> Behan </PERSON> urged support for a bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, that would place some of the same restrictions on semiautomatic assault-style pistols and rifles that are now imposed on automatic weapons, including <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background checks and fingerprinting of purchasers. The bill also would limit magazine size to 20 rounds. <PERSON> Behan </PERSON> said he believes `` it's only a matter of time'' before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> bans the weapons, adding, `` In any legislative approach, what wins is persistence.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said law enforcement officials can `` overcome the lobby of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> `` impacts on elected sheriffs just like it does elected members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. If we can stand the heat, so can they,'' he said. The Police Executive Research Forum is an organization of chief executives of the largest city, county and state law enforcement agencies. Other organizations supporting bans on assault-style weapons include the <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriffs </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, himself an avid picture-taker, jokes that the press photographers who cover him helped get him good publicity during the first part of his administration by focusing on the family dogs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally presented the annual awards of the White House News Photographers' Association Tuesday.

 Pressure is building on <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> to abandon his support for an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> state official whom conservative, pro-life advocates oppose for a top job in the department. But <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> continues to support <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, which manages the government's major welfare programs, a spokesman for the secretary said. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, suggested Tuesday that the secretary stop pushing the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to nominate <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>, who is under fire for his handling of the deaths of two dozen babies with the crippling deformity spina bifida. The incidents occurred at an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> state hospital while he headed the state's human services department. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said that while he is still looking into the allegations against <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>, `` I think there's lots of indication he might want to put this in abeyance and back off.'' `` I think it's going to be a cause celebre if he -LRB- <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> -RRB- continues with it,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure he needs to get in the middle of a great big fight over it right now.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has run afoul of right-to-life advocates before with comments that appeared to support abortion rights. To mollify his critics, he agreed to recommend for nomination to several top jobs at the agency people acceptable to pro-life groups. The welfare job was not among the jobs mentioned at the time and its duties do not have much to do with abortion. However, a group of conservative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators say <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>'s actions in the spina bifida matter show him to be too insensitive to the right-to-life views. <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>, who is now <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> secretary of social services, is criticized for failing to act promptly to end the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> state hospital policy of withholding life-saving care from spina bifida babies. <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> says that shortly after he became director of the state human services department, he learned of the policy and put into effect regulations and policies designed to assure such denial of treatment would not recurr. But critics say the protections he instituted were required by federal law and they note that the doctors involved were never sanctioned. <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> met with half a dozen senators on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> earlier this month to try to allay their concerns. However, following the meeting, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and five other senators signed a letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressing their continued opposition to <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> was not among them, but he said the spina bifida allegations `` disturb me'' and need further review, as do new concerns that are being raised. Among the new charges is one that <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> lobbied against requirements in a bill in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year that required welfare recipients to work for their benefits. That requirement is part of the new welfare reform law <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> must put into effect. <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said the provision he lobbied for on behalf of his boss, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON>, is similar to the provision that appeared in the final version of the bill and is now law. `` I've been a supporter of workfare for a long, long time,'' he said <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> also said he is looking into a lawsuit filed against <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> for a policy he established as human services director that allegedly discriminated against women. The case was referred by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, where it is pending.

<HEAD>Radioactive Antibodies Seek and Destroy Cancer Inside the Body</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nuclear-tipped antibodies that seek and destroy cancer inside the body show promise of giving doctors a new way to attack tumors, researchers say. The goal is to blitz cancer cells with huge doses of killer radiation. Doctors launch the attack with protein probes that hunt down the cancer deep within the body. In initial experimental use, researchers found that the strategy wiped out all detectable cancer in people who were not helped by ordinary treatment. However, far more study will be necessary before researchers know for sure whether this approach will cure cancer. The findings were presented Tuesday by Dr. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> to the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oncology </ORGANIZATION>. Press is one of several researchers around the country who are working with radioactive antibodies to combat cancer. However, he said his group is using the highest doses of radiation yet tried. `` We're trying to blast them out of the water,'' he said. Antibodies are natural hunters produced by the body to find germs, cancer and other dangerous invaders. Scientists can now produce large quantities of antibodies that look for cancer, and they have fitted them with powerful warheads of radioactive iodine. With this strategy, doctors believe they can deliver far higher doses of radiation than would otherwise be possible and still spare healthy tissue from harm. Press and colleagues have given the treatment to seven people with the blood cancer lymphoma. All had failed an average of four kinds of chemotherapy. The treatment wiped out all visible signs of the cancer in five of them. `` The percentage of patients responding is much greater than we would expect from conventional chemotherapy,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. In other research presented at the meeting: _ Dr <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> reported preliminary evidence that a combination of three drugs followed by radiation can eliminate bladder cancer. If this approach works out, it would provide an alternative to surgical removal of the bladder, which is now standard treatment. _ Many doctors are reluctant to give chemotherapy to women with early breast cancer, because most can be cured by surgery alone Dr. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Paterson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, has found that those who relapse often carry multiple copies of an abnormal gene, known as an oncogene, inside their tumors. Checking for this gene may help doctors target chemotherapy to those who are most likely to benefit. _ Dr <PERSON> Gastan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jude </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said a review shows that about two-thirds of all youngsters with acute lymphocytic leukemia, the most common childhood cancer, can now be cured. He attributed the improved outlook for this disease, which was once almost uniformly fatal, to continued improvement in chemotherapy. _ Dr <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deaconess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said a new treatment can overcome low levels of white blood cells, which are a common side effect of treatment with the drug AZT in AIDS patients. The therapy, called granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, prompts the body to produce more blood cells. _ Dr <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> said a combination of chemotherapy and radiation shows promise of allowing doctors to avoid removing the voicebox in victims of advanced throat cancer. People who received the new treatment appear to have as good a chance of survival as do surgery patients, and most retain their ability to speak. _ Dr <PERSON> Harinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Garewal </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> said initial studies suggest that a nutrient called beta carotene can reverse precancerous growths in the mouth. This condition, known as oral leukoplakia, is common in smokers. Many vegetables are high in beta carotene, which the body converts to vitamin A.

<HEAD>Prominent Scientists Oppose Administration Plan to Produce Tritium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prominent scientists are blasting as wasteful and premature a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plan to expand production of a key material for nuclear warheads. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, a former designer of atomic weapons, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathjens </PERSON>, a former chief scientist in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has more than enough tritium to sustain its nuclear arsenal for several years. Tritium is a radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power of nuclear warheads. The two scientists were testifying before a special <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel investigating the nation's tritium needs and the administration's plans for modernizing its weapons facilities Senior officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also testified publicly, and intelligence agency officials later appeared before the panel in a closed session. The only three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reactors capable of producing tritium, located at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Site </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, have been shut down for safety reasons since last spring. The administration has cited an urgent need to get them running by early next year. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has endorsed a plan developed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to build by 1998 two new tritium-producing reactors, one at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the other in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, at a cost of approximately $ 7.5 billion. Both <PERSON> Rathjens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> said it's not necessary to rush a restart of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors, which have been plagued by structural and operator problems in recent years. The pair also advised postponing the decision on whether to spend the huge sums needed to build the two new-generation reactors. `` Until well into the next century, I do n't believe we need to worry about production'' of tritium, <PERSON> Rathjens </PERSON> said. `` We're not balancing on a knife's edge.'' <PERSON> Rathjens </PERSON> suggested the administration propose to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a mutual moratorium on tritium production as a means of advancing arms control. To forge ahead with construction of two new tritium-producing reactors would `` send the wrong signal'' to the Soviets and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies about American interest in disarmament, he said. A new construction plan might lead the Soviets to think `` we are contemplating at least a doubling of our weapons stockpile'' or planning to produce a large number of neutron weapons, which require more tritium per weapon, <PERSON> Rathjens </PERSON> said. He and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> support <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills introduced last week that call on the administration to negotiate a U.S.-Soviet ban on the production of plutonium, also needed to make nuclear warheads. The administration opposes the bills. `` We need to have those <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors restarted as soon as we can,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary's top adviser on atomic energy, told the panel. He submitted a written statement, dated April 26, that said, `` We are near the point where this tritium will be exhausted'' unless production is resumed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplies of both weapons-grade plutonium and tritium are classified.

<HEAD>40 Years of Division Fail to Answer the `German Question'</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 West Germans today celebrate 40 years of a statehood that has brought them peace and prosperity, but many feel a nagging guilt over the fate of their brothers in the east. The `` German Question'' _ reunification with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ still haunts <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> despite its postwar emergence as a financially strong and influential independent power. New generations on either side of the concrete and barbed-wire border have diluted the fervor for reunification and added to the traditional questions of `` whether?'' and `` when?'' the consideration, `` at what price?'' The appeal for a single <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has gained momentum from the recent East-West warming trend. Many West Germans have relatives in the other <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and about one in five have visited the Communist eastern state over the past decade, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Allensbach </LOCATION>. But `` you get an entirely different picture when the German question asks not just whether reunification is desirable, but whether one is willing to see <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> leave the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance to achieve it,'' said the institute's <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Herdegen </PERSON> in an interview. Yet in a January survey, 51 percent of the West Germans polled said they would be willing to trade <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> membership for reunification. The appeal of neutrality and better relations with <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has also been reflected in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s recent dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance over the future of its short-range nuclear missiles. And it may gain momentum next month if Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> indicates during a planned visit a willingness to consider eventual reunification, as has been predicted by some officials. `` We are certainly not expecting him to signal readiness for reunification, but he could indicate in some way that the subject is open for further discussion,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausmann </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bavaria </ORGANIZATION>, which is aligned with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. Others have dismissed the rekindling of reunification talk to the recent troubles between <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. `` After seemingly being filed to the archives, the subject of German reunification rises again whenever German-American relations are not doing so well, whenever <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> does not do what <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> believes is right,'' the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Westdeutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allgemeine </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Essen </LOCATION> commented last week. It, too, suggested <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may signal some willingness to accept a reunited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, banking on a neutral state posing less of a threat to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> than as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who faces a tough re-election campaign next year, has been waxing optimistic on the reunification question. `` Not all of our dreams have been fulfilled,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> noted in a statement on the eve of the 40th anniversary. `` We remain under the order of our Basic Law to make complete the unity and freedom of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In recent years the hope has grown that this goal can be achieved.'' The federal government's program for observing the anniversary notes `` the division remains a bitter reality for Germans.'' But if West Germans have made a few tentative steps forward with the political question of reunification, the advance has brought them a closer look at the costs. Among the improvements noted in relations between the two Germanys has been a major increase in the number of East Germans allowed to emigrate to the west, which has strained the budgets and patience of communities hosting the settlers. While West Germans remain committed in principle to reunification, it would require an expensive overhaul of the aging and outdated industries of the east and subsidies to boost living standards _ perhaps at the expense of their own.

<TEXT>
 Governing party chief <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON> was named <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s new premier today, succeeding <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo-hua </PERSON>, who has been criticized as taking an overly cautious approach to economic and political reform. A statement from the party said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s appointment was unanimously approved by the 31 members of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at a regular weekly meeting chaired by President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON>, who had nominated <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, 75, will continue to serve as premier until later this month when the lawmaking Legislative Yuan, which is controlled by the Nationalists, will formally approve <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON>'s appointment. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON>, the party's 72-year-old secretary general, will name a new Cabinet but observers expect him to retain most of the present members because he helped groom them. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> has been criticized for his conservative policies at a time when the Nationalists are pushing a more flexible foreign policy to regain international recognization for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Younger members of the party also consider him a liability in a parliamentary election in December. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON> was educated at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tankok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and is considered among the most liberal senior Nationalist officials. He was a close aide to the late President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, whose father <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> led the defeated Nationalists to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 when they lost a civil war to the Communists on the Chinese mainland. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has been <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> secretary general since 1987 and helped <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> end 38 years of martial law two years ago. A major newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said in an editorial that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s appointment would usher in a new era of political developments in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> that would `` give higher priority to political modernization than economic development.'' Analysts believe this could help <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 66, who became president last year when <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> died and has pursued a more pragmatic foreign policy, including the first visit by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> officials to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the Nationalists were overthrown 40 years ago. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Fu </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, questionedd whether <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON> would push through any drastic reforms. `` <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON> is not so rigid as <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> but he is not a reformer,'' <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> said. `` Liberalization will move forward steadily but gradually.'' The party statement did not say who would succeed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. But newspapers have said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Soong </PERSON>, 47, the party's deputy secretary general, is a leading candidate.

<TEXT>
 Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' condition is not improving and his doctors say it's a miracle he's still `` He's the sickest I've ever seen him,'' Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, an infectious disease specialist, told a news conference Tuesday. Doctors said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is dependent on life-support equipment and the prospects for his survival are slim. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is unable to breathe on his own and is undergoing constant kidney dialysis, they said. `` He would die if he was off the ventilator. He would die if he was n't going to get dialysis. He would probably die if his cardiac medicines were removed,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. `` This is a multi-factoral problem.'' The 71-year-old <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who has been hospitalized at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> since Jan. 15, is suffering from massive bacterial infection, kidney failure, cardiac failure, pulmonary failure and pneumonia, the doctors said. `` It's a miracle he's survived so far,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' cardiologist. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' condition has been unstable and very critical since he suffered kidney failure and underwent a surgical procedure Thursday to prepare his veins for extended kidney dialysis. Dr. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON>, a kidney specialist, said a kidney transplanted into <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in 1984 stopped functioning because of the infection. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been on a respirator for three months. Transplant surgeon Dr. <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> would not specify how long <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> might live, but said it probably would not be long. `` I think if you asked any one of us we'd all say he has a low probability of long-term survival,'' <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' fever was 101 degrees Tuesday, but had climbed as high as 104 degrees during the past few days, <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. Although the prognosis for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remained poor, the doctors would not rule out the possibility of recovery. The former leader's illness has prevented him from traveling to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to face racketeering charges alleging he plundered his homeland of more than $ 100 million and used the money to buy real estate and art in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, who also is charged, last week appealed to <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to allow her husband to die in his homeland. The request was denied. The Marcoses have lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since February 1986, when they were ousted in a civilian-military revolt that brought Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power.

 A man was executed by injection early today for helping to rape and strangle a woman who was abducted as she awaited help in her disabled car following a New Year's Eve party in 1981. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> gave no final tatement, although he smiled briefly to four friends he had invited as witnesses. He coughed and his chest heaved five times as the drugs began to take effect, then uttered two low and long groans before he stopped breathing at 12:25 a.m. The 40-year-old <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> electrician was the 31st <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> convict and the 110th in the nation executed since the 1976 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allowing states to resume capital punishment. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> lost a final appeal late Tuesday when the court voted 5-4 against a stay. The action, which came without comment, was unusual since the appeal was <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>'s first to reach the high court. It has been routine for initial appeals to merit at least one reprieve. `` The significance of this is the courts very clearly are indicating impatience with dilatory tactics within the process and they intend to expedite the process,'' said state Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> was convicted in the murder of <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The 18-year-old Conroe woman was abducted by <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> and two other men from her car, which had broke down on a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> freeway as she was returning home from a New Year's Eve party. According to trial testimony, <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> raped the woman and then held her legs down while <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Paster </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> strangled her with an electrical cord. Testimony also showed <PERSON> Paster </PERSON> hammered a nail up the woman's nostril to make certain she was dead. Miss <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> would have turned 27 on Monday. <PERSON> Paster </PERSON>, awaiting death for another slaying, received a life sentence for the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> murder. Last month, he was caught with another death-row inmate in an unsuccessful escape attempt. <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>, who testified for the state, received a 35-year term. `` The death penalty was made for people like <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> to protect society from people like him and from people like <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Paster </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambright </PERSON>, who prosecuted the case. `` There was no remorse, no drugs, no alcohol, no real explanation for the violence except they were just mean,'' <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> had insisted he was in another room when the woman was slain. `` I knew what was going on,'' he said in an interview last week. `` I just could n't do anything about it. ... `` I'm right with the man upstairs. I know this. He knows I'm innocent It's not that that bothers me about dying. It's to die for something I did n't do and to look like a sicko doing it. `` Sometimes you make the wrong decisions. That's just the way it goes. I'm happy with myself, happy with the Lord. I'm at peace with myself. I know I did n't do it.''

<HEAD>Youths Riot, Attack Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOLVERHAMPTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 500 youths hurled gasoline bombs at police in a racially mixed district of the central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Wolverhampton </LOCATION> following a drug raid in a tavern, police said. The rioters Tuesday night also threw up a makeshift barricade across a street, looted at least one store and set a local council office on fire, said Deputy Chief Constable <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> police. In 1985, predominantly black and racially mixed areas of British towns and cities including <LOCATION> Wolverhampton </LOCATION> were swept by a wave of protests of police harassment. In the worst incident, a policeman was hacked to death in the <LOCATION> Tottenham </LOCATION> district of north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Social workers said the underlying cause of those riots included high unemployment among young people, especially young blacks, and poor housing in inner-city areas. <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> told a news conference that the trouble began in Tuesday night when police raiding the pub made 20 arrests, 12 for drug offenses, and seized marijuana and crack cocaine. He said 250 officers _ members of the police drug squad and a police support unit _ were attacked by the mob. The officers dispersed the mob in about two hours, he said. `` The conduct of these youths reacting to legitimate police action in making a serious drugs raid is totally reprehensible and inexcusable,'' <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> said. In February 1987, 13 people were arrested, shops were looted and windows smashed in rioting in the area following the death of a local black man. The black man had collapsed after a struggle with two policemen who were called to a shop when a clerk became suspicious that the credit card the man was carrying might have been stolen. An inquest returned a verdict of accidental death. Last year, parcel bombs were mailed to two senior police officers and to a former police official. Police said the bombs were believed to be the work of a group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>.

 The state needs tougher laws to keep repeat offenders in custody, said Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> after a man with a long history of assaults on children was accused of raping and mutiliating a 7-year-old boy. The arrest of <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON>, 39, has frustrated police, prosecutors, mental health professionals and relatives who had tried to keep him in mental hospitals or jails. <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON> was charged with attempted murder, rape and assault after the boy was found in a wooded area, naked and bloody with his penis cut off. The boy was in satisfactory condition Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON>'s 38-year-old brother, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, said: `` He's my brother and I love him. But God, he's driven the whole family nuts for 20 years.'' If guilty, `` he should be put somewhere where he's safe and where people are safe from him,'' said his mother, <PERSON> Delores </PERSON>. `` He's crying out for help,'' she said. `` He says he did n't do this, but he has two personalities _ a loving son and then the man who may have done this.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> on Tuesday called for a change in the law so individuals with a known risk for committing such crimes `` could be subject to involuntary treatment and civil commitment under some code or statute.'' State Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said Tuesday he would ask corrections and mental health officials why <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON> was free. `` I want to see their explanation,'' <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said. `` This guy by all accounts had no business being out on the street.'' <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON> pleaded innocent Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, two days after the attack. Bail was set at $ 1 million and trial for July 17. Reports on <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON> through 1977 show authorities considered him mentally retarded. In 1987, psychologists and psychiatrists at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> concluded he had a learning disability and five disorders, including pedophilia and an anti-social personality. His troubles with the law began in 1965, when he was declared a `` defective delinquent'' after choking a 7-year-old girl. The term, now abandoned, referred to juveniles prone to violence because of mental or emotional problems. In November 1966, he was sent a school for the developmentally disabled after he led authorities to the body of a 15-year-old classmate. But he was considered too dangerous for the school and was committed to <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> psychiatric hospital from 1968 to 1973. In 1976, he was acquitted in two assault cases, but the next year he pleaded guilty to assaulting two 16-year-old female hitchhikers. The judge ordered him committed to the sexual psychopath program at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, but he was rejected there and spent his entire 10-year sentence at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Corrections Center. Subsequent efforts to return him to Western State were rejected by a judge, although late in his prison term <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON> was found with lists of items he would need to maim or kill youngsters, officials said. `` We did everything legally possible to keep him in custody,'' said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bail </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Indeterminate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentencing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. In November 1987, <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON> pleaded guilty to assault in the stabbing of a 16-year-old boy and served 66 days of a 90-day sentence. A subsequent evaluation at Western State found <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON> dangerous, especially to youngsters, but there was no sexual aspect to the case, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendizabal </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Last October, <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON> was sentenced to 67 days in jail after pleading guilty to attempted unlawful imprisonment in an attack on a 10-year-old boy who was tied to a post and beaten. `` I do n't think there was anything more we could have done to keep him out of reach any longer than we did,'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladenburg </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dollar Climbs Against Yen in Tokyo, Stocks Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar climbed further against the yen today, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index erased early losses and finished slightly higher. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 33,851.82, up 35.21 points, or 0.1 percent, from Tuesday, when it lost 251.25 points. The Nikkei lost another 34.12 points this morning, but then investors reacted positively to the yen's apparent stabilizing against the dollar, said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. But most market players stayed on the sidelines because of lingering uncertainties over the currency market, a possible central bank discount rate increase and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s political situation, <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> said. Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 650 million shares, down from Tuesday's 700 million. The dollar closed at 143 yen, up 1.05 yen from Tuesday's 141.95-yen finish The dollar, at a 19-month high, now has gained 8.56 yen since May 11. It opened today at 143.15 yen and fluctuated between 142.45 yen and 143.70 yen. The dollar's strong opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed its rise in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, triggered by comments by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, traders said. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> that `` inflation is not dead. You do n't want to declare victory too early.'' <PERSON> Masafumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Koyama </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Japanese investors concertedly bought the dollar early in the morning. ... But the dollar slipped -LRB- later -RRB- as some market players sold it for profit-taking and position adjustments.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> sold dollars intermittently in efforts to check the dollar's rise, but it was not central bank intervention that led the currency lower toward the end of trading, he said. The central bank does not comment on its activities on exchange markets. `` Investors kept buying and selling the dollar as the rate moved, trying not to keep much money in their hands,'' <PERSON> Koyama </PERSON> added. `` Still, the market has a strong demand for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money,'' he said. Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> today that credit policy should be considered on the basis of various indicators, but declined to comment on an expected increase of the official discount rate, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 Students and workers demanding democratic reform are taking to the streets throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, from dusty <LOCATION> Lanzhou </LOCATION> in the west to <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION> in the distant northeast. While the world focuses its attention on the student uprising in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the upheaval is rapidly spreading in areas of the country beyond the international eye and not normally associated with political activism. Sources contacted at several provincial capitals say workers are supporting the student demonstrations and sit-ins. They say the rallies demand Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>'s resignation for declaring martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, up to 500,000 people have paralyzed traffic in marches to the waterfront business district and the People's Square. About 100,000 marched Tuesday night in the southern city of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, a business center normally known for its lack of interest in political matters. In <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and the inland city of <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION>, people set off firecrackers and cheered when they learned of a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> radio broadcast that claimed <PERSON> Li </PERSON> had been forced out. The report not be immediately confirmed. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, a teacher from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said 100,000 people were on the streets in <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION> Tuesday night. He said sit-ins have been going on continually in front of the railroad station and the party and government headquarters. Residents are bringing the students hot food and medicine, he said by telephone. `` Support from the workers is really quite amazing.'' Among the many people marching in support of the students was a group of 20 blind people, <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Lanzhou </LOCATION>, people placed wreaths on a central square for a woman student who reportedly died during a hunger strike. An American source said students were going to factories to talk to workers about their cause and workers were leaving their jobs to meet them. All major universities in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s northeastern cities of <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Changchun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dalian </LOCATION> have been shut down by strikes, said a Western source in the area. `` There's an atmosphere of tension which we did n't have a week ago,'' the source said on condition of anonymity. `` Everyone is sitting very, very tight'' waiting to hear what will happen in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Class boycotts also continued in <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION>, and at least 20,000 people have been on that city's streets every night since martial law was declared in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 20, an American there said. She said that since the government began jamming Chinese-language broadcasts of the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, students frequently try to glean information from foreigners about activities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION>, handouts of the latest <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> reports are pasted on walls, and students in <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> are the only reliable sources of news. Sources said students have streamed back and forth to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to keep their colleagues in the provinces abreast of what students in the capital are doing. In <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION>, however, authorities have stopped selling train tickets to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to halt the flow of student supporters. Demonstrations have also been reported in <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Suzhou </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hefei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guiyang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Urumqi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hohhot </LOCATION> and dozens of other cities. In <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION>, students broke into the city government compound, and in <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> students last week stopped all traffic on a bridge crossing the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Official newspapers in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> say little about disturbances outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and a few other cities, but it appears certain that few places have escaped the student-led upheaval.

 Three-time Country Music Association Entertainer of the Year <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> returned for an `` apology concert'' and said `` some idiot'' drugged him before his aborted May 6 concert. `` When you're a champion, they like to knock you down,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the audience Tuesday night. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> began his previous performance with rambling 20-minute speech, made a false start on several songs, cursed the crowd and stormed offstage. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 39, who is known for his songs of hard drinking and rowdy living, agreed to pay concert organizers $ 65,000. He later offered to do Tuesday's concert at his expense. `` I hate drugs,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told Teusday night's sellout crowd of 10,000. `` I detest drugs. I'll have me a beer, and I'll have me a drink, -LRB- but -RRB- drugs have killed too many people. ... `` I'm mad for them -LRB- the fans -RRB- and I'm mad for me,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. He told the crowd that `` some idiot'' had slipped `` a foreign substance in my drink'' before the May 6 show. A report released Monday by <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gangwisch </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, said blood and urine tests taken four days after the concert were positive for Valium, `` a foreign substance available only by prescription and which Mr. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> stated he did not take or possess.'' The city of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> charged $ 5 a ticket for the concert. Proceeds will go to a fund for the families of police and firefighters killed in the line of duty. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' father, the country singer-songwriter, <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, died in 1953 at age 29 from the effects of alcohol abuse.

 Two brothers who kept police at bay for seven hours burned to death in a blaze apparently started by the firebombs they were tossing at officers, authorities said. Autopsies showed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Limoli </PERSON>, 63, and his 62-year-old brother, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, died of smoke inhalation, said <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balraj </PERSON>. There was no other evidence of injuries to the men, Ms. <PERSON> Balraj </PERSON> said. The trouble began Monday night when neighbor <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsdell </PERSON> called police to report that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Limoli </PERSON> had threatened him. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, 24, who lives with <PERSON> Ramsdell </PERSON>, said: `` The guy was just flipping out. One second he was talking about the Jews getting killed in World War II; one second he was asking if <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> was a Democrat or a Republican; and then he kept going on about the Bible and God.'' Several shots were fired from the house at police officers, but no injuries were reported among police and officers did not return the fire, a police spokesman said. `` Members of our SWAT team tried talking to <PERSON> John </PERSON>, but got no response,'' police spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Jezior </PERSON> said. `` But we saw a person we perceived to be <PERSON> John </PERSON> throwing makeshift firebombs out of several windows, and also inside the house.'' One of the bombs apparently ignited the house, authorities said. `` The fire was started by liquid that he had filled up in bottles,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennerll </PERSON>. `` He had approximately six of them that he threw out the windows of the house.'' According to <PERSON> Dennerll </PERSON>, some of the firebombs apparently bounced off windows back into the house.

 The brother of reputed mob boss <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> was convicted of managing a multimillion-dollar heroin ring, ending a six-year legal battle that included two mistrials. The jury returned its verdict against <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> on Tuesday night, seven days after deliberations began and about three hours after a federal judge dismissed a holdout juror who said he feared for his family's safety. <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> and co-defendant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON> showed no emotion as the jury pronounced them guilty of racketeering, possession with intent to distribute heroin and conspiracy with intent to distribute heroin. <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON> also was convicted of an interstate travel violation. Both men face up to 50 years in prison. Jurors were polled and then asked by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON> whether anything the dismissed juror told them affected their verdict, or whether the dismissal itself affected their decision. All answered no. <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON> allowed the two to remain free on $ 1 million bonds pending a full bail hearing June 20. No sentencing date was set. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRusso </PERSON> said he was happy with the verdict. `` The evidence was clear,'' he said. `` It was a matter of putting the pieces together.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischetti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>'s attorney, said he was confident the verdict would be reversed on appeal. The verdicts came three hours after <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON> dismissed the juror. The juror, referred to only as juror No. 9, told the judge he was scared by a visit last week from two men who asked if he was on the <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> jury. The juror said there were no explicit or implied threats from the men. <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON> dismissed the juror and told the remaining 11 to resume deliberations. When they came back 15 minutes later with a verdict, the judge sent them back, saying, `` I do n't think that you have had enough time to deliberate without juror No. 9. I ask you to lay aside what you might have heard from juror No. 9.'' The jury earlier had sent a note to the judge saying all but juror No. 9 had reached informal agreement on a verdict. Juror No. 9 was an alternate until just before deliberations started, replacing one who was dismissed last Wednesday after it was revealed that he lived in the same neighborhood as an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent assigned to the case. At the first trial, prosecutors alleged jury tampering by some of the defendants, prompting an unusual proceeding involving nine federal judges and ultimately a mistrial in January 1988. The second trial was declared a mistrial in July after a juror was dismissed when cocaine was found in clothing brought to him during deliberations and the 11 remaining jurors announced they were hopelessly deadlocked. The third trial was reassigned to <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON>, who at 91 is one of the oldest federal judges. The defense requested a mistrial this time after it was revealed that one of the jurors was the cousin of a federal prosecutor who worked at the courthouse. A second request involved accusations in the news media that <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON> had fallen asleep during the prosecutor's opening statements. <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON> rejected all mistrial motions. The case stems from a 1983 indictment. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> is reputedly the boss of the Gambino organization, the nation's most powerful Mafia family.

 More than 100 pieces of woodwork and furniture made by craftsman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakashima </PERSON> were destroyed in a house fire, authorities said. `` Everything's gone, a total loss,'' said Fire Chief <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Freda </PERSON>. ` The house and everything in it was destroyed.'' <PERSON> Nakashima </PERSON>, 83, is considered by many to be the elder statesman of American crafts. Only two pieces of the collection, owned by Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Krosnick </PERSON>, survived, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. A picture frame and a boardroom table were on loan for an exhibit of <PERSON> Nakashima </PERSON>'s work at the American Craft Museum in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The blaze began Tuesday morning when an acetylene torch being used by a plumber caught fire, said <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Musso </PERSON>. He said the plumber set the torch on the floor and went to find something to extinguish the fire. While he was gone, flames engulfed the basement and spread to the rest of the house. <PERSON> Freda </PERSON> said damages to the home and the contents amounted to about $ 1 million, but added `` estimates at this point are very unreliable. No one I've talked to really knows what the contents were worth.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Krosnick </PERSON> and her housekeeper escaped without injury, officials said. The plumber was treated at a hospital for minor burns to his hands and hair and released. `` It is a great loss _ for them and for us,'' <PERSON> Nakashima </PERSON> said from his studio in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` Some of the pieces can be replaced, but many can not.

 Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassin, <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, has an unpredictable capacity for violence and remains a threat to society, a state prison board ruled in denying him parole for the 10th time. <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, 45, who is serving a life sentence for the 1968 shooting of the Democratic presidential candidate, is not eligible for parole again until next year. Board chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on Tuesday called the shooting `` one of the most shocking criminal assassinations in the history of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' It was `` an attack not merely on an individual's life but on the political life of the country,'' he said. In his arguments to the panel, <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> apologized for the slaying, said he was no longer a threat to society and that he has n't given up hope for freedom. `` I feel very sad, very sorry, very remorseful ... that a human life was taken,'' the Jordanian-born <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> said. `` After 21 years ... I have become quite convinced that my act was very wrong, morally and humanly, toward <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and especially toward his family and his loved ones and his supporters.'' `` I realize the mistake of it and I wish from the bottom of my heart ... that this crime, this horrible event, never occurred,'' he said. After the board turned him down, <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> accused it of prejudice, saying the three panelists used `` specious'' arguments. The board told <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> it wanted him to complete a psychiatric evaluation program he began in March. The board also rejected claims by <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> McKissack </PERSON>, that it was not impartial because its members had been involved in a previous hearing at which they deliberated only three minutes. This time the panel deliberated nearly an hour. <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> argued that he has done everything officials have asked of him, has been a model prisoner, but is serving more time than most prisoners with first-degree murder convictions. <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Adel </PERSON>, watched the hearing along with reporters via closed circuit television at the State Correctional Training Facility in this small community 180 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We were hoping for more lenient consideration this time,'' he said glumly. `` Hopefully, next time will be better.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was shot with a .22 - caliber pistol as he walked through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> after winning the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> presidential <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, was sentenced to death for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s murder but was spared from gas chamber after <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s death penalty law was overturned in 1972 His sentence was changed to life in prison with possibility of parole, and <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> faced his first parole hearing in 1975. For the past six years, <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> has been in a maximum-security section at the Soledad prison. His release has been blocked repeatedly by parole panels that have cited reasons ranging from the effect the crime had on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political system to <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>'s potential for future violence <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> last came before the board two years ago. At that time, the panel recommended that he undergo extensive psychiatric evaluation, pursue vocational training, attend Alcoholics Anonymous sessions, remain free of disciplinary problems, earn an associate's degree and provide documentation of job offers <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> told the panel he was not a man of violence. He blamed the shooting on a volatile mixture of politics, youth, and alcohol. `` A lot of people do n't realize <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was my hero,'' <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> said. He said he turned against <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> because of his support of the sale of 50 fighter jets to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, then drank too much, got a gun and shot him. <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> said he does n't hate any politicians now and is n't a threat to supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He said he understands Jews better now because, like the victims of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, `` I've been exposed to gas chambers.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has graduated its first class of new pilots since the carrier's crippling strike began March 4. Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots union, however, told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that the pilot training raised serious safety issues. `` Our pilot training is going very smoothly,'' company spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` This is a very heavily experienced group.'' Two new pilots are already flying and about 20 more completed training this week, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. Eastern said 452 new pilots have begun training during the past two months, joining nearly 250 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots who are crossing picket lines. Also Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> until 5 p.m. today to line up financing for its proposed $ 415 million purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s lucrative <LOCATION> Boston-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Washington </LOCATION> shuttle. Under a rebuilding plan submitted to federal bankruptcy court, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> says it needs about 1,700 pilots to return to about two-thirds of its prestrike operations. Eastern has been flying about 10 percent of its prestrike schedule of nearly 1,100 daily flights that used 3,600 pilots. Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and reorganization on March 9, says it can rebuild a smaller, profitable carrier without its unions and after selling $ 1.8 billion in assets. Eastern unions want the parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to sell the airline. Attorneys for the pilots union, which has joined the flight attendants in honoring the striking <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union picket lines, filed a detailed attack Tuesday on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s rebuilding plan. The airline ca n't possibly train enough new pilots to meet its rebuilding goals, the union said. `` The training of these new pilots also raises certain serious safety issues regarding the lack of experience among the pilot crew,'' the union said. Union spokesman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said the Eastern training has been marred by a high dropout and failure rate, that training has taken longer than usual, that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is using instructors from sister airline <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and that training has been chaotic. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the failure and dropout rate has been running at normal levels. The first group of graduates averages 5,782 hours of flying experience, compared with the prestrike average of 4,000 hours for recruits, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. The average age of the recruits is 38.3 years, with most coming from corporate duty or commuter airlines. During a brief hearing Tuesday in bankruptcy court, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said it would consider <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' offer for the shuttle withdrawn if it could not meet today's deadline. Eastern already has agreed to a $ 365 million offer for the shuttle from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. If <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> arranges the financing, Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> must determine whether it is satisfactory before both offers for the shuttle are considered further. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> must approve any sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets.

 Comedian <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> said in an interview weeks before her death that husband <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> always believed she would be well and never displayed fear of the ovarian cancer that killed her. `` I'm lucky I'm with a man who is n't superficial,'' she said in the interview in June's Glamour magazine. `` I think he was really put to the test.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> congressman is to receive an honorary degree from an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> college that he says turned him away 31 years ago because of his race. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, D-Ga., is a native of Troy, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and in 1958, he applied to what was then <ORGANIZATION> Troy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> In a statement from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, office, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said Tuesday that his application to the college was denied because he is black. <ORGANIZATION> Troy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> plans to present <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> with an honorary doctorate of law degree at its commencement June 2. `` I have received several degrees in the past few years, but this degree is very special because it comes from the university in my hometown and the school I always wanted to attend,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who also has honorary degrees from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> and other colleges. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchannon </PERSON>, public relations director for <ORGANIZATION> Troy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview Tuesday night that university officials did not know about the school's rejection of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> when it voted in March to give him an honorary doctorate of laws. `` They're awarding it to him for being a <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, native from a basically outlying area of this town, who obviously has made good in his state and on the national level,'' <PERSON> Buchannon </PERSON> said. `` For that reason, our board thought he was deserving.'' The board's resolution commending <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> lists some of the congressman's accomplishments, including his role in civil-rights organizations and his former position on the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. It also outlines his education, which includes a bachelor's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Fisk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> went after being turned down in Troy. He said it was the school's refusal to accept him that led him to <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and to the civil-rights movement. After <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> State </PERSON> rejected him, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> wrote Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, requesting help in getting into Troy State. King replied with a bus ticket to <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and an invitation to come to talk about filing a lawsuit against the school. Soon after his talk with <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> joined others pushing for civil rights. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> decided not to sue <ORGANIZATION> Troy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and later went to school in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where he led sit-ins and demonstrations calling for an end to racial discrimination. `` This honorary degree represents many of the advancements we have made in the areas of education and civil rights in the past 30 years,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Buchannon </PERSON> said he realizes the degree illustrates how far the university and society have come in civil rights, but he emphasized that the school chose to honor <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> `` for his exemplar life.''

His health was very good,'' he told the radio. `` He was very cheerful. I asked him if he had any pain and he replied that he has very little and that he is comfortable.'' The radio was monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, said Tuesday that his father was in `` very good condition'' after the surgery.

<TEXT>
 Premenstrual syndrome may contribute to violence in women's prisons, and helping inmates cope with depression, anxiety and other symptoms may prevent trouble, a psychologist said. `` Prisons need to recognize if women suffer from PMS and train people to teach about it,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Harri </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> psychologist who specializes in PMS and has consulted with prisoners. For unknown reasons, women who live together often begin to menstruate at the same time each month, she told participants Tuesday at the Third National Workshop on Female Offenders. `` Do you remember going to college, living in a dorm, cycling with your roommate? Think about women in a prison,'' she said. `` Those women in a prison are going to cycle together. `` There are times when they have behavior disturbances. If you have more than one woman who is premenstrual at one time, who has PMS, then of course you're going to have behavior disturbances.'' PMS is a hormonal condition in which a variety of symptoms regularly occur in the same phase of the menstrual cycle, usually the week before menstruation begins, and disappear, usually within a few days. It can lead to mood swings and, in rare cases, acts of violence, <PERSON> Harri </PERSON> said. Helping inmates deal with the disorder will speed rehabilitation, she said. `` PMS is not a cause of criminal behavior, but it can be a contributing factor to it'' she said. `` Some women become very aggressive and out of control.'' About 32,800 women were housed in state and federal prisons as of December 1988, said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrothers </PERSON>, commissioner of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Sentencing Commission. <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulkownik </PERSON>, a corrections officer at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Waynesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, is one of about 500 people attending the four-day conference. She said she has noticed many of the 200 women at the prison menstruate at about the same time. `` You can just tell when everybody is going into cycle,'' she said. `` There's a shortness of temper, a lower tolerance for people.''

<HEAD>Two White Men Hanged, 7 Black Men Given Reprieves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two white men convicted of murder were hanged today. In a separate case, two black men, including a member of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, received reprieves to apply for a new trial. Lawyers for Human Rights, which appealed to President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> for stays of execution, said Minister of Justice <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> issued stays late Tuesday for the blacks. They were convicted of killing a black policeman in February, 1986 by placing a burning tire around his neck. The lawyers' group asked for a retrial for one of the men, <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Sibusiso </PERSON> <PERSON> Senele </PERSON> <PERSON> Masuku </PERSON>, 22, because, they said, new evidence had been found that state witnesses may have been forced to give false evidence against him. The other defendant given a reprieve was <PERSON> Oupa </PERSON> <PERSON> Josias </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbonane </PERSON>, 20. The two white men who were hanged at <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Central Prison were convicted in separate cases of murder and robbery of white victims. One of them had not filed any appeals and had asked for his execution date to be moved up, lawyers said. Four more men were scheduled to hang Thursday, and appeals for reprieves were pending. Meanwhile, the appellate division of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, set aside the convictions of six black men sentenced to death in June, 1987, for the 1985 slaying of an 18-year-old black woman. One of the convicted men has since died of natural causes. The appellate court ordered the other three released from prison today, saying the court that tried the four had been improperly constituted. The ruling brought to 13 the number of condemned men whose death sentences and convictions have been overturned since September. In an unrelated matter, police said an <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla shot himself to death after wounding a black woman and shooting a policeman in the chest on Tuesday. Police did not identify the dead man. They said the shootings occurred near <LOCATION> Nelspruit </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the largest guerrilla group fighting to oust the white-dominated government.

 A 17-year-old girl whom <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> is accused of filming in a pornographic videotape bragged to friends that she planned to blackmail the star for $ 2 million, a newspaper reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Constitution </ORGANIZATION> cited an affidavit filed last summer in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the divorce of the girl's parents. The girl's mother filed a lawsuit May 12 seeking unspecified damages from <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, the Brat Pack star of such movies as `` About Last Night'' and `` St. Elmo's Fire.'' District Attorney <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, 24, could face criminal charges for exploitation of a minor. The girl was 16 at the time of the alleged incident. Documents filed in the lawsuit over the videotape have been sealed, but newspaper lawyers argued Tuesday that they should be made public. News reports have said that the girl, who turned 17 in April, met <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> at a nightclub in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> during last summer's Democratic National Convention. According to an affidavit from an acquaintance of the girl, the teen-ager said she and another woman had sex with <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> and `` they all took turns filming each other,'' the newspaper reported. Another affidavit, from the girl's next-door neighbor, alleges the girl planned to use the video to blackmail <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> for $ 2 million, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s public relations firm Tuesday said the actor has no comment `` until the matter is resolved.'' Judge <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> closed the court record on the lawsuit shortly after it was filed because `` the harm otherwise resulting to the privacy of the parties in interest clearly outweighs the public interest.'' A hearing on the newspapers' request for access to the documents has not been set.

 A speeding passenger train derailed and most of its cars plunged into a ravine in northern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, killing eight people and seriously injuring 59, officials said today. The train was traveling Tuesday night at 47 mph hour as it took a hillside curve. It should have been going less than 30 mph, said <PERSON> Phairot </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotjalermngam </PERSON>, public relations chief for State Railways of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Thirteen of the train's 15 cars derailed, he said. The accident occurred in <LOCATION> Phrae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, about 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. Soldiers were helping pull the wreckage out of the ravine today. State Railways officials said the Bangkok-bound express was traveling from the northern city of <LOCATION> Chiang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mai </LOCATION>, about 80 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Phrae </LOCATION>. Eight people were killed and 59 were hospitalized, <PERSON> Amporn </PERSON> <PERSON> Larnlua </PERSON>, the railway's general manager for administration, told a news conference. Another railways official said the driver and conductor were among those killed. People from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> were among those reported hurt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Larter </PERSON>, 29, and his girlfriend, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, 24, both of <LOCATION> Brisbane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, were among those slightly hurt. In telephone interviews, <PERSON> Larter </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> said their rail car was thrown into the ravine when the fast-moving train derailed. `` I felt a crunch, and then the carriage rolled and people just flew,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>. `` I ended up sitting on a fan on the roof, and there were people underneath me.'' She said three rail cars piled on top of each other, trapping many passengers. `` It was horrific,'' she said. <PERSON> Larter </PERSON> said it was two hours before rescue teams arrived at the thickly forested area. The <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Mai-Bangkok </PERSON> train is usually packed with passengers and is often taken by foreign tourists. <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> is known for its hill people, trekking routes and the nearby `` Golden Triangle,'' where the borders of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> converge. It is one of the world's major opium growing areas. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s last serious train accident was in May 1988, when a truck rammed into a train in <LOCATION> Nakhon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sawan </LOCATION> province 130 miles north of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, killing 21 people.

The French news agency Agence France-Presse said he was arrested at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Priory </ORGANIZATION>, which is run by followers of Monsignor <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefevbre </PERSON>, a fundamentalist priest. <PERSON> Lefevbre </PERSON> was excommunicated from the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> last year after a long battle with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> over church doctrine.

In 1945 and 1947, <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> was sentenced to death in absentia on convictions of collaborating with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and executing and torturing members of the resistance. <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> was the <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> head of the Milice, which worked closely with the Gestapo during the Nazi occupation. At the time, the Gestapo was headed in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>, who in 1987 was sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity. <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> was not caught, and the sentences against him could not be carried out because of a 20-year statute of limitations. President <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Pompidou </PERSON> quietly pardoned <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> in 1971, restoring his rights as a citizen. <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> went into hiding two years later when new charges were raised. Charges of crimes against humanity were filed against him in 1981, and an international arrest warrant issued. The new warrant lists six charges, including the slaying of <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Basch </PERSON>, the 81-year-old president of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, who had taken refuge in the <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> area. Investigators determined that when <PERSON> Basch </PERSON> and his wife were arrested by <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON>'s Milice in January 1944, they were `` judged too old to be deported and they were killed on the spot.'' Magazines and newspapers have published extensive accounts of <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON>'s protection by the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy until 1967. The address on his official identity card was the archbishop's headquarters in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, and church officials reportedly lobbied for the 1971 pardon Since <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON>'s return to hiding, there have been reports that he came under the protection of fundamentalist <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> with extreme-right political views. Historian <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Amouroux </PERSON>, a specialist on <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s wartime collaboration, said <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON>'s trial would bring out `` the role the church played in the protection he was accorded.'' In an odd twist, a death notice for <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> was published in a <LOCATION> Grenoble </LOCATION> newspaper in 1984, giving thanks in the name of his family for expressions of sympathy. It was never explained, and there were frequent reports afterward that <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> was seen in monasteries in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Andre </PERSON>, 61, said in an interview that he was surprised by news of the arrest, because he had been `` 99 percent'' convinced his brother had died. `` In a certain sense, his arrest is a good thing. The inquiry will show, even if he is not lily white, that people have exaggerated and made a mythic figure out of him,'' <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Police are investigating a Japanese machinery company that may have illegally exported to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> rare materials for use in nuclear reactor rods, officials said today. The Tokyo-based Prometron Technics allegedly exported an unspecified amount of hafnium to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1986 and 1987 without clearance from the Japanese government, a police official said on condition of anonymity. Executives of the company, which has a branch office in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, allegedly carried the metallic chemical element in their luggage when they traveled to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc country, the official said. <PERSON> Prometron </PERSON> <PERSON> Technics </PERSON> maintains technology swaps with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Electrotechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> and several other East German companys, he said. Hafnium is principally used to make control rods for reactors on nuclear-powered vessels and submarines. It is among a list of items strictly regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multilateral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, a Paris-based watchdog body that controls trade in strategic items with the communist bloc. Police on May 9 searched the offices of Prometron Technics and the home of the company president, <PERSON> Hirokuni </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON>, the official said. He said an investigation into whether the firm violated customs laws and foreign exchange and control laws is still under way. Violators face up to five years in prison. The case is the tenth involving Japanese firms accused of violating the watchdog agency rules since 1985. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of electronics giant <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, sold sophisticated propeller milling equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1986 in violation of committee rules. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials charged the equipment helped the Soviets manufacture quieter submarines, and thus undermined Western security. The incident prompted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to prohibit <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for three years beginning in 1988.

<HEAD>Bolshoi Dancers Vow To Go On _ Even Without Costumes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The stars of the Bolshoi Ballet say the show must go on even if they have to pirouette in hand-me-downs after their luggage got lost. Ten crates of costumes and props that were supposed to arrive ahead of the 30 Bolshoi dancers who are opening in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Thursday disappeared in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> during transit, and the company is having to make do with borrowed goods. A high-level diplomatic search continues for the baggage, sent nine days ahead of time on <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s state-run airline. `` We know the flight took off from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and we know it landed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arons </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Classical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which is sponsoring `` The Stars of the Bolshoi Ballet'' tour. `` But we have no idea where the crates are,'' she said. A second shipment of ballet essentials has been sent from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and is expected to arrive Friday night or Saturday, Ms. <PERSON> Arons </PERSON> said. In the meantime, the dancers will borrow from the <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ruth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Page </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION>, which is sending its entire production of `` Giselle'' to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> by bus. `` It's like if the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> went out onto the field in <LOCATION> Cubs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> and Indians uniforms,'' Ms. <PERSON> Arons </PERSON> said Tuesday. The borrowed costumes have meant extra rehearsals for fittings and practicing of precision moves. `` The greatest problem is the toe shoes,'' said prima ballerina <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessmertnova </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter. `` We are used to our shoes, and they are special shoes. Russian toe shoes are different. Every dancer has a master who makes the shoes by hand to fit perfectly to the foot.'' `` Maybe some of us will have to dance in the costumes first and then we will all have to switch, but we'll make the best of it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bessmertnova </PERSON> said. `` We have already cried. Now we have to laugh.'' The dancers are scheduled to give four performances at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Civic Opera House Besides `` Giselle,'' the program includes excerpts from other classical pieces such as `` Swan Lake'' and `` Sleeping Beauty.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> today extolled the virtues of his nation on its 40th birthday, praising the spirit that has made <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> a world economic power but warning against `` self-satisfaction.'' At a celebration to observe <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s founding, <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> said Germans, through their suffering and successes of the postwar period, had earned the right to enjoy prosperity. He declared his nation's allegience to the West, twice praising the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for its help in rebuilding the West German state from the ashes of the Third Reich. His clear embrace of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance appeared to be a signal to the increasingly left-leaning populace that notions of a neutral German state are ill-advised and could jeopardize peace and stability built over the past four decades. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is embroiled in a dispute with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over the fate of short-range nuclear missiles, and the argument has strained relations among the traditionally close allies. `` Under the conditions of the Cold War, it was easy to be united,'' <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> told his audience at <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s Beethoven Hall. `` It becomes more uncomfortable when the world no longer gives clear information on who is for us and who is against us.'' <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> praised Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the `` breathtaking'' process of change he has introduced in his country, but he tempered the accolades with a warning that no one is sure of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader's future. He paid tribute to West German economic prowess but said West Germans have much work ahead of them. `` The economy is blooming, science has won back its prominence and education has become an example for the world,'' said the 69-year-old president, re-elected Tuesday to a second five-year term. `` Yet we have no ground for self-satisfaction,'' <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> said. `` We have not become angels under the Basic Law.'' The Basic Law, adopted May 23, 1949, serves as the constitutional foundation of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and has won praise for guiding the defeated nation from ruin to international respect. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the world's largest exporter and enjoys one of the highest standards of living and a strong social security net. But <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> suggested <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s way of life is threatened by resistance to social change. In particular, he decried the lot of German women, who bear the brunt of a system that has been slow to develop day care or flexible work scheduling, despite the fact that about two-thirds of the nation's women work outside the home. `` As never before must the family make way for the work market, instead of the other way around. This is regretted by all. And the women bear the lion's share of the burden,'' the president said.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of ethnic Turks demanding more rights clashed with security forces across northeastern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, and at least two protesters died when troops opened fire, the official <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> news agency said today. A third person died of heart failure during the clashes, and three people believed to be ethnic Turks were injured, <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said. Turkish newspapers reported today that 25 ethnic Turks were killed in the clashes, which occurred in northeastern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, where most of the country's 900,000 ethnic Turks live. The unrest Saturday and Sunday appeared to be some of the worst ethnic violence since the early 1980s, when <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s Communist authorities restricted the Moslem religion, banned public use of the Turkish language and tried to force ethnic Turks to adopt Bulgarian-sounding names. In <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Inal </PERSON> <PERSON> Batu </PERSON> told reporters the government had formally asked <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> for information about the unrest. In addition to the village of <LOCATION> Todor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ikonomovo </LOCATION>, where the shooting deaths occurred, riots also broke out in some areas of the regions of Razgrad and <LOCATION> Varna </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION>. Foreign diplomats said they also heard reports of clashes between ethnic Turks and security forces in <LOCATION> Dulovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kaolinovo </LOCATION>, in northeastern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. An emigre source in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, said fatalities occurred in those regions when police and troops opened fire on protesters. Authorities moved in tanks and helicopters after the clashes in Razgrad, a diplomat said. Communications to the city were cut. `` Extremist-minded individuals, some under the influence of alcohol, committed a gross violation of peace and tried to draw groups of the population into acts of lawless violence,'' <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said. It said that `` despite numerous appeals to abide by the law, a group led by extremist elements attacked and ill-treated civil servants _ police officers included,'' in <LOCATION> Todor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ikonomovo </LOCATION>, about 190 miles east of <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, the capital. `` An attempt to break into the village people's council and seize the arms kept there resulted in a confrontation,'' according to the report. It said security forces fired warning shots, and the casualties occurred when bullets bounced off the pavement and hit protesters. A man died during riots in the town of <LOCATION> Kaolinovo </LOCATION>, and a post mortem found that heart failure was the cause of death, the news agency reported. An emigre source said the clash in <LOCATION> Kaolinovo </LOCATION> was prompted by a petition that four ethnic Turks sent to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last month urging that the minority's ethnic rights be restored. The source said the four were arrested May 1 and punished with labor on state farms. Bulgarian authorities do not recognize the existence of a Turkish minority in the country. <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> blamed the disturbances on `` inaccurate information provided by some local authorities'' on recently liberalized travel laws, which allegedly created `` misunderstandings among certain strata of the population.'' The new measures, passed by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> this month, make it easier for the country's 8.9 million citizens to get a passport and journey abroad. They also apparently make it easier for Bulgarian citizens to emigrate. The official report did not exactly how the alleged `` misunderstandings'' of the travel laws gave rise to the unrest. Emigre sources in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said a protest hunger strike among the ethnic Turks, which started May 6, had spread to several parts of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and involved up to 300 people at a time. Groups of people were reported taking turns in the fast for a few days to publicize the plight of the Turkish minority prior to a human rights conference starting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> May 30. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> ruled <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> for 500 years before 1863 and there is a long history of conflict. Periodic unrest has been reported since 1984 in ethnic Turkish areas. Reports of growing protest have circulated among diplomats in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> for at least a month.

 With Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s signing of two bills today, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> becomes the first state to ban military-style assault weapons. The legislation the Republican governor planned to sign would ban the manufacture and sale of more than 50 semiautomatic rifles, pistols and shotguns on Jan. 1. Attempts to restrict such weapons had been blocked repeatedly by the gun lobby, led by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, until a shooting rampage at a <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> school four months ago left five children and the gunman dead. The slayings by a deranged drifter carrying a semiautomatic AK-47 rifle rallied the public support needed to push the measure through. Under the legislation, people who owned the listed weapons before June 1 may keep them by obtaining permits. Otherwise, the guns can be possessed only with a special-needs permit, such as those obtained by movie studios for machine guns. Possession would be a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine, or a felony, carrying up to three years in prison. The bills would also increase the penalties for crimes in which assault weapons are used. The bills would allow the attorney general to go into court to add similar guns to the list.

 The 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler Sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the Titanic. The dead, many of them emaciated from Confederate prison camps, totaled more than 1,500, but newspapers of the day gave scant notice. The horror was lost in the greater <PERSON> gore </PERSON> of Civil War and presidential assassination. Until now, there had been no marker here for the Union soldiers who perished in the muddy <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. But on Sunday, a six-foot granite marker is being unveiled in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Elmwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> as a reminder that the Sultana went down in flames just seven miles north of the city's downtown riverfront. Built for 300 passengers and a crew of 76, the steamship was carrying more than 2,300 people plus 100 horses and mules when three of its four boilers exploded at 2 a.m. on April 27, 1865. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> lawyer who has researched the disaster for a dozen years and is writing a book on it, said Union officers may have overloaded the paddlewheeler to inflate troop transport payments. `` There were two other steamboats that were trying to get a portion of the men. The only explanation I have been able to uncover for why the Sultana got them all is bribery,'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Berryman </PERSON>, a forensic pathologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, estimated the death toll at 1,547, 44 more than the number of people lost when the ocean liner Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in 1912. Other counts of the Sultana victims have put the total between 1,400 and 1,450, but <PERSON> Berryman </PERSON> said those estimates failed to include one of three trainloads of soldiers who boarded at <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, Miss. The monument, financed by three <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> residents, will be the second of two major markers to the disaster. The other, in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, was put up in 1916 by <PERSON> Sultana </PERSON> survivors who raised money for the monument. Researching the disaster has been difficult because newspapers of the day were still primarily concerned with the assassination of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> two weeks earlier and with the end of the war. `` It was just lost to history because of the other events that were going on at the time,'' <PERSON> Berryman </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> has shifted its course since the Sultana went down, and the steamboat's remains rest now under a soybean field about a mile east of the river in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. Excavating the boat could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and would produce little of commercial value since the wreck was salvaged two months after it burned, he said. <PERSON> Berryman </PERSON>, who wrote a paper on the Sultana last year for the <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, said survivors told of watching dozens of victims drown en masse, hands clasped together as they grappled for survival. `` Many of these victims had been through some of the roughest battles in the war, and those experiences paled in comparison to what they went through that night,'' he said. Most of the victims had recently been freed from prison camps in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and were headed north to be released from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Many were crowded onto two decks directly over the paddlewheeler's four 18-foot boilers, one of which had developed a leak that was hastily repaired. When one of the boilers blew, setting off two others, the upper decks collapsed forming a funnel that dumped dozens of victims into the fire, <PERSON> Berryman </PERSON> said. The 263-foot boat, made of wood and covered with flammable paint, was equipped with 76 life jackets. Many of the survivors also escaped by clinging to debris. One survivor floated to shore on a dead mule. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> investigated the disaster and a captain in charge of loading the troops at <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> was found guilty of mishandling his duties. His conviction was overturned on appeal, however, and he was honorably discharged.

 <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> threatened to walk out of an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> summit today if any moves were made toward concessions to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> crisis proved the most divisive issue for Arab leaders. Syrian leader <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, rather than <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, threatened to delay the closure of the extraordinary summit, which was convened Tuesday mainly to welcome <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> back into <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> ranks after a 10-year ostracism. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> today continued to press his support for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslem leader, acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, while <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s strongest challenger in the Arab world _ <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and its President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> _ outspokenly backed <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. While the conflict is undecided, the summit remains closed to the rival <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> delegations for the first time in Arab League history. The leaders met behind closed doors Tuesday and today but failed to resolve the issue. The summit was scheduled to close later today, but Moroccan officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the dispute might force a delay until Thursday. <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> invited some of the quarreling leaders to a private meeting in his palace late Tuesday. Several had not met for years, and <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> persuaded some of them to shake hands, conference sources said. Those shaking hands included <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, and everyone with <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, the sources said. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> moved quickly to reassert <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s traditional domination of the Arab world when he reoccupied <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s seat in the league for the first time since 1979. That was the year <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> was suspended for signing its peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has become a grave problem,'' the leader of the Arab world's most populous state said at the opening session. `` It exhausts us and is exhausting our consciences. We must work together to overcome this crisis before the fire overcomes us all.'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> sat silently during <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s 20-minute address, taking notes. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s national news agency MAP and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> met privately Tuesday night with Presidents <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, in what MAP described as a warm session of reconciliation. The Egyptian agency quoted its Information Minister <PERSON> Safwat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherif </PERSON> as saying the leaders openly discussed differences of opinion and a `` spirit of understanding'' prevailed. Liby' a news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> has warned <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> would walk out if any attempt were made to surrender to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by compromising on the Arab demand for Palestinian statehood. No such surrender has been discussed. In his speech Tuesday, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> asked the league to back the efforts of its six-nation committee on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to restore Lebanese national unity and end the civil war that is in its 15th year. In particular, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said, the committee should seek withdrawal of all foreign forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> _ meaning both <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> and Israelis _ and help the country live peacefully under its `` constitutional authority.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> gave <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s full backing to the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and backed the right of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people `` to choose whatever road they find suitable for the achievement of their aspirations.'' He also spoke of `` the great financial burden'' of the uprising on the Palestinian people, echoing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> complaint that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states have not lived up to their promise of financial aid. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said only <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have paid anything.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> today accused communist authorities of breaking a promise made in historic accords by refusing to legalize the country's independent student union. Angry students, meanwhile, called off a sit-in at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> they had called to protest the rejection. They said the government refusal was a futile attempt to divide students from Solidarity just before June 4 parliamentary elections, and they promised to redouble campaign efforts for the independent union's Parliament slate. Just hours after a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> court refused Tuesday to register the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the government struck a further blow by banning a scheduled broadcast of Solidarity's election show from state television. Registration of the student union, known as <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION>, and opposition access to television were both agreed to by Communist authorities in the broad `` round-table'' agreements reached April 5 with the Solidarity-led opposition. `` The rejection of the registration of <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> breaks the round-table decisions,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in a statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The court said it rejected the student group's registration application because <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> did not renounce the right to stage student strikes. The government press office said it had no immediate response to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s charge and referred inquiries to state television and to a court spokesman. Spokesmen at both institutions said no one was available to comment. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s statement included no reference to the cancellation of the TV show but he promised that his free trade union movement would pursue the issue of <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> with authorities. `` Solidarity will not abandon the matter of <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> registration,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` Solidarity will give <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> access to its offices and to other means until it is registered.'' Solidarity-endorsed senators and deputies to parliament also will raise the matter after they are elected, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> pledged. Announcement of the television ban on the Solidarity program came just as the show was to go on the air Tuesday night. An announcer read an official communique that said authorities had blocked the show `` because the contents ... aim against the round-table agreements.'' The main thrust of the agreements was that Solidarity would be reinstated after a seven-year ban if the opposition agreed to take part in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first democratic elections since World War II. Tuesday's 45-minute broadcast would have been the third such Solidarity-produced TV show. Today's editions of the opposition daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> said the program was to have included a discussion on the law led by opposition journalist <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Falkowska </PERSON> as well as interviews with Solidarity candidates for the two-chamber legislature. The government communique said that state TV management, which is headed by former government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, had decided to refer the program to an arbitration committee that includes Solidarity activists. The committee, co-chaired by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, was set up to handle disputes that arise in the implementation of the accords. `` The opposition presents many programs on radio and television containing aggressive and bitter remarks,'' the communique said. `` There are however limits which may not be crossed, as they would erase the constructive achievements attained at the round-table ...'' At the round-table, the opposition agreed to take part in `` non-confrontational'' elections to the current unicameral parliament, or Sejm, and a newly created <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that is to be the first freely elected legislative chamber in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. Only 35 percent of the Sejm is open to opposition candidates. The remaining 65 percent is reserved for the ruling Communists and their allies. The banning of the program was the lead item in today's editions of <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION>, while official newspapers did report on it. A Solidarity-produced radio broadcast was shortened May 17 because a censor barred a segment of it. And <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION>, which has just begun publishing, has come under sharp attack in the Communist Party daily <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION>.

 Reformers said today they are hopeful the new parliament will be truly independent because the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called a <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> meeting of its deputies and did not issue orders on what policies to pursue. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, which opens Thursday, is the country's first legislature chosen in contested elections in seven decades. The decision of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ the only political power in the 70 years _ not to dictate policy at a Tuesday gathering offered hope for democratic decision-making, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputy <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said. `` This is very important,'' <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said. `` There are no decisions required of all the deputies.'' About 80 percent of the congress' deputies are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but party leaders can not count on automatic support among <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> radicals or from the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republics </LOCATION>, which want freedom from Kremlin control. <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said the spirited discussion Tuesday indicated the congress itself will be `` open and active.'' `` We were surprised that so many deputies from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> were so free in expressing their opinions,'' said <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristen </PERSON>, a deputy from the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. Party ideology chief <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> added to hopes, saying on national television late Tuesday: `` I do n't think we should limit any discussions. We just have to live through them.'' Today, hundreds of legislators met in strategy sessions to hastily garner support for proposals to solve the political and economic problems facing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. For the first time, they must please the voters who chose 1,750 of the congress' 2,250 deputies. The remainder were appointed by official organizations. The formal duties of the congress are to meet annually, choose a president and 542-member Supreme Soviet legislature, and approve the president's recommendations for premier, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and national prosecutor. But cooperatives want to repeal a decree that kicked them out of profitable businesses, Armenians want a solution to ethnic problems and Baltic leaders want economic independence. A group of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reformers, including figures as diverse as human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and populist party official <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, will propose congress consider economic and political reform. And <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has gone as far as saying it ought to replace the smaller Supreme Soviet as the legislative body. A poll reported in today's <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said 89 percent of 1,100 city dwellers nationwide believed the congress should discuss the economic, social and political situation in the country. `` The people expect very much _ unfortunately,'' said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbak </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> deputy known for his writings on the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant disaster. `` The people expect us to be able to solve everything immediately.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda today quoted a resident of south-central <LOCATION> Kemerovo </LOCATION> as saying he hoped to `` make our life, our country such that you can once again say without blushing, ` I am a citizen of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.''' The party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday proposed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for president, and little opposition is expected. However, a battle may develop because reformers want <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to make a report on the state of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> before they vote for president. The official schedule gives the congress just two morning sessions before the Supreme Soviet convenes on Saturday. The party has planned for election of the president and Supreme Soviet as the first order of business, followed by discussions. But the progressives are demanding discussions first, and then elections. `` We have to pick the Supreme Soviet deputies after we have seen in the discussions who is who,'' said <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>. Otherwise, he said, the congress will be no better than the old rubber-stamp legislature, where officials blathered while deputies wandered off to the caviar-and-sturgeon buffet and unanimously approved legislation studied for all of 20 minutes. Few negative votes were cast in the previous 1,500-member Surpeme Soviet that the new body is replacing. Reformers, speaking to TV interviewers late Tuesday, said the party should not be afraid of dissent. `` If there is democracy, then these factions are inescapable,'' historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a specialist on the repression of the Stalin era, could not be published for years. But he has gained acceptance in the freer atmosphere of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and won a parliamentary seat from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Writer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Granin </PERSON>, another reformer, added the `` customary unity of opinion is extraordinarily dangerous. We have lost a lot because of it.''

<HEAD>Arrested Man Claims to be Missing American in Fraud Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police said today they arrested a man claiming to be an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> whose disappearance four years ago led to allegations he faked his death to collect $ 2.8 million in life insurance. The man, in custody in <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION> on shoplifting charges, claims he is <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Windsor </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, police said. The 43-year-old man was charged under the name <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>. Police said he also used the alias <PERSON> Rodoleho </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancano </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Auckland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> newspaper today quoted police spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchier </PERSON> as saying the man's claim to be <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was supported by fingerprints and photographs sent from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who used to fill vending machines with candy and earned less than $ 10,000 a year, supposedly fell overboard while on a ferry in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> in 1985. Lloyds of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> insurers refused to pay $ 2.8 million in insurance policies <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> took out in the 18 months before he vanished. A witness said he saw <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> fall from the ferry. But Lloyds produced witnesses who said they had seen <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> after his alleged death, and it contended the insurance policies were an elaborate fraud scheme. The mystery man faces three charges of theft and escaping from custody following his arrest on Monday. He was scheduled to appear in court June 7. Police would not comment on possible extradition. The insurance case is still pending.

<HEAD>Claude Pepper: Never Too Old or Too Lonely to Quit</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 5th graf, Many of, to correct that Bush turns 65 next month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On a wall of his cluttered office hangs the faded letter that <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Denson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> wrote, before leaving for work one July morning in 1978, to his wife of 43 years as she lay dying of cancer. `` Dearest Mildred,'' it said. `` You have not awakened. ... I pray for the early time when we can go together as we have done for so long. ... I love you with all my heart.'' <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, 88, never old enough nor lonely enough to quit, has waited for more than a decade for that time, though it may finally be at hand. As he lies seriously ill at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, the love letters are flooding in from a nation. `` Perk up,'' says one card scrawled by a shaky hand. `` You work so hard, you're probably just exhausted.'' Many of the well-wishers are Americans 65 and older. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will join their ranks next month, recently paid a bedside visit. To senior <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the withered, dog-faced congressman from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is a peerless hero, an ever-alert guardian of the fastest growing and, in his view, the most commonly mistreated segment of the population. The oldest member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Pepper is known both as Mr. Social Security and Mr. <PERSON> Medicaid </PERSON>, for his efforts to establish and strengthen both programs. And thanks to him, federal law now bans employers from forcing workers to retire before age 70. His own advice to the older set was to `` keep on doing what you're doing,'' but maybe at a slower pace. `` I was playing golf one day,'' he said a few years back, `` when I noticed my partner's clubs were lighter than mine. I found I could handle them easier. So I changed to less weighty clubs. `` So that's what you do in life,'' he said. `` When you come to a time when there's a need for any sort of change, simply lighten your clubs and go right ahead.'' Despite heart surgery in 1976, despite relying on a pacemaker since 1982, despite dismal hearing and vision _ he wears a hearing aid in each ear and thick, horn-rimmed trifocals over his blue-gray eyes _ he has n't lightened that much of his load. Though emotionally numbed for more than a year by the death of his wife, Pepper charged back in the 1980s, keeping long office hours and gallivanting around the country to push his own social legislation in the face of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget cuts. `` I've got a lot to do,'' he said. `` Except for my terrible burden of loneliness, I enjoy life. It has always been good to me.'' His legislative achievements, spanning full careers in both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, are legend, reaching far beyond his concern for the elderly. He fought for the first minimum wage, 25 cents an hour, in 1938. His first bill, that same year, extended federal assistance to handicapped children. He was among the first members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to support equal rights and equal pay for women. Born in 1900 in rural <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, Pepper remains a pre-eminent eyewitness to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s turbulent journey through the 20th century. He was 5 years old, in 1905, when he first saw an automobile. He witnessed the celestial passing of <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>'s Comet in 1910, and again in 1986. He met <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, and greeted the Apollo 11 crew on their return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. He stared <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> down in a Nuremberg beer hall, sized up <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, and earned <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s undying affection for casting the only vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the Lend-Lease Act the first time around It has long annoyed Pepper that some of the younger generation presume to think that he champions the elderly because he is old himself. He was 28 years old and a member of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> legislature when he introduced a bill waiving fishing license fees for senior citizens. He was in his 30s when he took up <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s crusade for Social Security. `` I was a New Dealer,'' he has said, `` before there was a New Deal.'' One of his first bills, in 1937, created the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the first of several government centers to explore cures for diseases that especially afflict the elderly. He was 36 when he was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where he remained for 14 years until his defeat in 1950 by fellow Democrat <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Smathers </PERSON> in an extremely bitter election. After an interim and lucrative 12-year period in private law practice, Pepper has now spent 26 years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. A homely man, 5-foot-7, with a bulbous red nose and the mournful face of a bassett hound, Pepper has lived on his dreams. As a farm boy in <LOCATION> Dudleyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, he carved `` <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Senator'' into a tree trunk when he was 10 years old. While at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the 1920s, he waited on tables in cafeterias and emptied coal ashes in a power plant to earn his tuition. But he still managed to graduate with top honors. He taught law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> before moving to <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to practice. He first race for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ended in a narrow defeat, but he was elected without opposition two years later, in 1936. To this day, his staff and friends call him `` Senator.'' When World War II broke out, Pepper, convinced that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> had to be stopped, pushed for the draft and massive military assistance to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Isolationist fever still gripped most of the nation, and women's groups assailed him as a warmonger and hanged him in effigy. After the war, he got heat from conservatives, including <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, father of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, for having visited <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Others were angry over his anti-segregation views, including his efforts to repeal the poll tax in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON>, author of `` Gothic Politics in the Deep South,'' the campaign <PERSON> Smathers </PERSON> waged to defeat Pepper in 1950 was `` the most elaborate crusade of political annihilation ever conducted in Southern politics.'' <PERSON> Smathers </PERSON>' supporters attacked Pepper on the racial issue and legend has it that <PERSON> Smathers </PERSON> would tell his less-educated audiences: `` Do you know that <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> is known all over <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a shameless extrovert? Not only that, but this man is reliably reported to practice nepotism with his sister-in-law, and he has a sister who was once a thespian in wicked <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Worst of all, it is an established fact that Mr. <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, before his marriage, habitually practiced celibacy.'' <PERSON> Smathers </PERSON> denies ever making that speech; Pepper says it was reported at the time. `` In the vilification contest, I was like a hummingbird fallen into a nest of screech owls,'' said Pepper. When Pepper returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> 12 years later as a freshman congressman, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s son was president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` A lot more charming than the father,'' said Pepper. Now, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s grandson, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, is a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleague. He called the hospital the other day to say he was pushing Pepper's home care bill. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> remains, it seems, a man for his own generation. And several others as well.

 A Japanese company says it has come up with a new home video game that offers more color and sharper graphics than <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> _ at about twice the price. <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of Japanese computer and telecommunications giant <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>, announced Tuesday it would begin selling the new video game system in the fall. The new game `` allows us to provide the user over 10 times more color and 16 times bigger characters,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>. `` You will be able to see them cry, you can see the eye movement, the muscle movement,'' he said. `` In the baseball games, you will be able to see dirt on the players' uniforms when they slide.'' The new game will sell for about $ 200. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>, which offers computerized video games played on regular TV sets, holds about 75 percent of the $ 3.5 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market for such games. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today said the key to the <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> system is a 16-bit graphics processor that provides clearer and more detailed images than those generated by <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s smaller processor. The system also will have an optional compact disk player attachment that produces stereo sound. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> does not release the size of its processor, but it is believed to be 8 bits, the Times said. Officials at <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, Wash.-based <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> said they were not worried. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> games, which emerged after 1985, are believed to be in 17 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households. `` -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- software is offering improved graphics, but it's not offering another level of play and challenge to the player,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> director of advertising. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> plans to offer a 16-bit machine in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> this summer and may introduce it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as early as next year, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A member of the state board that refused to consider a pardon for an armed robber who built a family and career during 10 years on the run says the woman can still hope for parole. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s attorney had argued that her release would send `` a message of hope'' to people to trying to rehabilitate themselves. But board vice chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said Tuesday he felt the state already provided `` mechanisms of hope, and the hope we provide in this state is for parole.'' The Department of Probation, <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> rejected Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s request for a pardon investigation by a 5-2 vote but moved up her parole date from April 1990 to Dec. 15 because of the work the 37-year-old woman has done in prison. If the investigation had been approved, the board would then have considered actually granting a pardon. <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who did not attend the hearing, had hoped to become the first inmate other than a terminally ill one to be pardoned since at least the 1940s, when the state Constitution was amended. The governor has no power to grant pardons. In 1975, Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, then known as <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, was convicted in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on five counts of armed robbery and sentenced to 12 years in prison. She walked away from a work release program three years later and hitchhiked to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Over the next 10 -LCB- years, she earned her high school diploma, overcame drug and alcohol abuse, married <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, raised a foster child and two sons and became a successful real estate agent. But Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s role as what others describe as a model citizen ended last year when she was arrested as a fugitive. Her previous husband, convicted of murder in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, had tipped officials to her whereabouts. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was returned to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to finish her term and serve an additional year for escape. Last fall, she was transferred to the Women's Correctional Institution in <LOCATION> Jessup </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, so she could be closer to home. Her husband, who drove all night from his Severn, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, home to attend the hearing, said afterward, `` It's going to be rougher now than it was.'' Overcome with emotion, he was unable to speak further.

 The struggle for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> heated up today with official reports of widespread military support for Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, whose attempt to crush the pro-democracy movement has led to mass demonstrations demanding his ouster. But <PERSON> Li </PERSON> faced new opposition within the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s best-known author, who joined the multitudes opposing the conservative premier. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> said a Politburo meeting would be called Thursday or Friday. Also today, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> informed Western television stations it was cutting off satellite transmissions as of midnight, ending their ability to broadcast from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> declared martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Saturday, ordering troops to restore order in the city where more than 1 million people have rallied in support of a student campaign for a freer <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and an end to official corruption. The student protests have galvanized the nation, inspiring the largest spontaneous movement in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 40 years. Soldiers were deployed on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s outskirts today but did not move on tens of thousands of student protesters, now on their 12th day of a sit-in at central Tiananmen Square. Over the weekend, throngs of city residents erected street barricades to prevent an army advance, stalling convoys. Hundreds of thousands of protesters also took to the streets in dozens of other cities. All reportedly called for <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s ouster. Subway and bus service resumed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and traffic appeared near normal today. Although the army's inability to enforce martial law has called into doubt its willingness to follow <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s orders, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said six of seven military regions supported the decision to call troops to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Only the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> military command was not mentioned. <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, the military newspaper, today published a letter from army headquarters urging soldiers sent to enforce martial law to `` fully understand the nature of this struggle.'' The letter said `` the turmoil created by an extremely small number of people still has not been quelled. If their scheme succeeds, then the 10 years of hard struggle for reform and the work of establishing of modernizing socialism will be destroyed in a moment.'' On Monday, however, more than 100 senior army officers signed a letter seeking an end to martial law, suggesting a deep split in the military. Two government sources said today that <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, one of five members in the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had thrown his support to the relatively liberal <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who is battling <PERSON> Li </PERSON>. Hu is in charge of the state-run press. On Tuesday, some official reports criticized <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s attempts to carry out martial law. Reports circulated that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> _ who had urged conciliation with the students _ had offered to resign rather than order troops into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. In the first indication of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s status in days, the foreign minister told diplomats Tuesday that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had returned to work. Early today, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> mentioned <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> for the first time since before the martial law order and referred to him as party general secretary. <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, cut short a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit Tuesday after meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Wan </PERSON>, who has praised the students for their patriotic fervor, was expected to call an emergency meeting of the legislature and press for <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s ouster. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, author <PERSON> Ba </PERSON> <PERSON> Jin </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was one of 500 intellectuals and high-ranking party members to sign a letter blasting the speech <PERSON> Li </PERSON> made Friday that signaled the start of a crackdown The letter also told the party to end press censorship and bring its struggle into the open. `` For 40 years now the party has made a series of major mistakes because life inside the party is not normal,'' the letter said. `` We must open the party to the supervision of the people.'' The student movement started April 15 following the death of ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, a favorite with intellectuals. Students initially called for a freer society and press and an end to official corruption, but after martial law was ordered they demanded that senior leaders resign. The struggle centers around <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s conservative faction, which opposes political reform, and a liberal group which has pushed some democratic reforms of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political system. `` They might allow him -LRB- <PERSON> Li </PERSON> -RRB- to go as a sacrifice,'' said one source. `` He has handled the martial law situation very badly.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, the 84-year-old senior leader, apparently backed <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s effort to suppress the student movement. But now his position is unknown. Another member of the conservative group is <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ximing </PERSON>, the party boss for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

 Firefighters from as far away as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today battled a swift wildfire that has scorched more than 75,000 acres in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. Smoke from the fire, centered in <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> about 30 miles from downtown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, caused a haze over much of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area. `` I believe the fire is moving at 1 mph, which does n't sound very fast, but for a fire it is,'' said duty officer <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Migliano </PERSON> of the state Division of Forestry. More than 250 people, including `` hotshot'' teams of seasoned firefighers from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, have joined the battle, officials said.

<HEAD>Woerner Says Possible NATO Missile Compromise Emerging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said today a possible compromise is emerging in the alliance's dispute over short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview that he thought there was a greater than 50 percent chance of a compromise being worked out before next week's <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit. The 16-member <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit, marking the 40th anniversary of the founding of the alliance, opens in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Monday. The dispute involves <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s call for early negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to reduce short-range nuclear missiles, which have a range of less than 300 miles. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> oppose such talks on the grounds they could lead to pressure to eliminate short-range nuclear missiles. They say the West needs nuclear arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to offset a big East bloc advantage in conventional forces. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Guardian and three other West European newspapers that he felt the dispute might not be resolved before the summit <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, interviewed from <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, was asked in the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> interview about a proposal, reportedly backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to link talks on short-range missiles to progress in talks on conventional force reductions. Asked if he thought that was likely to emerge as a possible compromise, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said: `` Yes, that is really one of the crucial questions _ which link do you establish between the conventional arms control talks and the start of the negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons? `` You can imagine several solutions. You just spelled out one of the possible solutions. They are still working on that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said this possible solution followed recent contacts between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. But it said there was already opposition to it in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with some people fearing that the conventional arms talks now being held in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> could drag on for years. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said he doubted this and maintained that the two sides in the dispute were not so far apart. He said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> could not afford a split at a historic moment when so many changes are taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Higher Excise Taxes Would Hit Rural Americans Hardest, Economists
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Raising excise taxes to reduce the federal deficit would impose an unfair burden on rural Americans, who already pay one-third more of their earnings for such taxes than do city dwellers, two economists said today. Economists <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> said they found that rural households at every income level up to $ 40,000 spend a bigger share of their earnings on excise taxes on motor fuel, tobacco and utilities. `` This differential tends to be greatest at low-income levels,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said at a news conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the study. `` If this Congress starts looking at an increase in excise taxes as a way to balance the budget, we want to say, ` No way,''' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Senter </PERSON>, national director of the 35-state farm group. Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have suggested raising federal taxes on gasoline, alcoholic beverages and cigarattes as ways of cutting the budget deficit. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, advocates a sharp increase in the gasoline tax _ but only if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agrees to go along There are mounting indications that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will approve no general tax increase this year, but lawmakers of both parties already are talking of the need for higher taxes a year from now. Long and <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON> concluded that the excise burden on rural families is 49 percent higher on gasoline; 41 percent higher on tobacco products and 21 percent higher on utilities, fuels and public services. Rural Americans pay 7 percent less of their income on alcoholic beverages than do others, but `` that difference would likely be reversed when weighted for beer consumption,'' they wrote. Using the government's Consumer Expenditure Survey for 1984 as a basis, the economists found, for example, that a rural family with income between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000 paid $ 402 in federal excises, while the urban family paid $ 335. At $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 income, rural families outspent urban families $ 461 to $ 429. Rural families between $ 30,000 and $ 40,000 were taxed for $ 523, compared with $ 486 for urban families. The study assumes families living outside an area with 2,500 population or more are rural. That covers about 40 million Americans.

<HEAD>Congress is Drawn Into Child Custody Battle</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is slowly being drawn into a custody battle so bitter that a prominent plastic surgeon has been in jail for almost two years on contempt charges after refusing to turn over her child for a court-ordered visit with dad. `` Every time I read about this case I see everyone wash his hands of it,'' Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., said Tuesday in urging passage of legislation that would free Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> from her <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> jail cell `` If we do n't act now, who will? This has been stalemated for 21 months,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee with jurisdiction over the nation's capital. Today, in the latest round of legal arguments in the 3-year-old case, a city appeals court was urged to overturn a lower-court judge's ruling that has kept the physician incarcerated since August 1987. `` Dr. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> is confined unconstitutionally because her incarceration will not serve a coercive function,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, told a three-judge <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> panel `` There is no substantive likelihood that she will relent -LRB- and reveal her daughter's location -RRB- _ not today, not tomorrow, not ever.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> accuses her former husband, oral surgeon <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, of sexually abusing their 6-year-old daughter <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was jailed on contempt charges for refusing to disclose where she hid the girl rather than allow her near her father. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> vigorously denies ever molesting his daughter. In an attempt to break the legal deadlock, he offered during an interview outside the committee hearing room Tuesday to submit to interviews with social workers and psychiatrists who would determine whether he was fit to be with <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>. Congressional involvement and <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>'s renewed effort at compromise are only the latest twists in the protracted dispute over the child. Normally, the 11-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> concerns itself with the city's schools, budget and police department, much like a city council in many <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities. But in this case, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> is trying to propel the panel, and the entire <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, into what amounts to a private quarrel between parents. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s bill seeks to limit imprisonment for civil contempt charges to 18 months. After that, the district would be required to either file criminal contempt charges against a person in <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s position, thus guaranteeing a trial, or dismiss the case The bill would be made retroactive for 18 months so as to apply to <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. Similar laws limiting civil contempt jailings are in effect in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` In this case, coercion has clearly proven to be ineffective,'' Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., said at the hearing `` At what point do we realize that this lady is really serious about this?'' <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> has said he's continuing to imprison the woman in an effort to coerce her into revealing her daughter's whereabouts. The city council has no authority over the city's court system. However, council member <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel he opposed setting a time limit for contempt jailings. `` If you put a cap on the court's authority, some people will decide they're willing to pay that price,'' <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON> said. `` I think that a court would be rendered less effective.'' <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON> suggested instead establishing a three-judge panel to review all civil contempt cases extending past 12 months. Under <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON>'s plan the panel, which would include the judge who initially jailed the person, would have to unanimously favor continued incarceration to keep the person in prison. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> blasted <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s bill, saying it offered no guarantees that <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> would be produced even if <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> were freed. `` <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> is the one we should be concerned with,'' <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> said. `` I have great concerns about her safety.''

 May 22 The Flint -LRB- Mich. -RRB- Journal on the demonstrations for democracy: At a time of unprecedented voter apathy in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the astonishing events unfolding in the streets of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and elsewhere around the globe serve to remind us of just how precious our democracy is. It is ironic, as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday, that, `` while an ideological earthquake is shaking asunder the very foundation of communist societies, the West is being tested by complacency.'' With depressing regularity in this country, too many public offices go uncontested, too many citizens are ignorant of issues, too few voters show up at the polls, too few know their representatives. In contrast, in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today, tens of thousands of citizens are demanding a truly democratic legislature. And while many in this country ignore news reports because `` the news is depressing,'' and while some try to discredit the media, information-hungry citizens in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other less fortunate countries are demanding a free press. Communist students and workers, young and old, are risking their lives for the tremendous freedoms so many of us have come to take for granted. They are demanding democracy. They are telling the world it is a principle, a system, a philosophy worth fighting for, worth dying for. It is something that Americans and other Western nations have known and appreciated for 200 years. But who would have guessed a decade ago that democracy would start spreading like wildfire to the communist strongholds of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>? If the seemingly unstoppable trend continues, as it appears it will, the implications for a startlingly different _ and better _ world are tremendous. ... We would do well to remember that a strong, vibrant democracy _ the kind of democracy that enhances human dignity _ can not coexist for very long with apathy, complacency or carelessness. As the brave Chinese students are reminding us, democracy requires courage, a well-informed citizenry and the participation of a determined, freedom-loving people.

 May 19 Walla Walla -LRB- <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> -RRB- Union-Bulletin on prison censorship: Prison officials must have the authority to keep order in penal institutions. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> went too far -LRB- last -RRB- week when it overturned a federal appeals court ruling that limited authority of prison officials to censor reading material of inmates. The court, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that wardens can ban any publication at federal prisons they believe is `` detrimental to the security, good order or discipline of the institution or ... might facilitate criminal activity.'' The justices said the officials do not have the burden of proving any of the publications threaten security, order or rehabilitation in prison. This, it seems, is the point at which the court went too far. The court's ruling means that a warden could stop the flow of all reading materials to inmates at a prison without a reason. It seems that inmates should be encouraged to read _ to better themselves _ while serving their sentences. Giving such ultimate authority to prison officials is inviting an abuse of power. Prison officials, if they can offer legitimate reasons for banning material, should have the privilege. Is it too much to ask that sound reasons for censorship be offered? What are prison officials afraid of?

That's what quite a few members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> apparently did last year when they passed a law setting up a new plan for insuring the elderly against catastrophic illness. ... Now ... across the country, thousands of <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- members are fighting mad at their national leadership for supporting a requirement in the 1988 law that all Medicare Part A recipients -LRB- those covered for in-patient hospital care and other services -RRB- purchase catastrophic-care coverage from the government. Glossed over during last year's health-insurance debate was that virtually all federal retirees, and most private-sector retirees, already have some form of private catastrophic coverage. Now, <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> members are particularly upset at being forced to pay a wealth-based tax surcharge of up to $ 800 next year for the long-term coverage, on top of premiums of $ 382.80 a year. ... Many members argue the legislation is also faulty because it does not provide coverage for critical needs such as nursing home stays, ... a benefit that many elderly people and their families need most. ... It was a classic case of lawmakers lazily accepting the sales pitches of six-figure <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyists and high-profile spokesmen as gospel. ... Perhaps if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others had done a little more of the old-fashioned kind of research _ listening to their constituents _ it would n't be looking to revise or repeal the catastrophic care law just a few months after it took effect.

Although Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will insist that the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> resolution was dictated by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, officers of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> Defense Forces who, perhaps alone, hold the key to his ouster, will have their loyalty -LRB- better said, the depth of their complicity in corruption -RRB- put to the test. ... The next step is the visit of an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation, formed by the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>, which has been charged with working out an agreement `` through democratic mechanisms'' to bring about `` a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.''

 A federal judge today declared unconstitutional the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s curfew law for juveniles designed to reduce drug-related violence in the nation's capital <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said the law `` subjects the district's juveniles to virtual house arrest each night'' and `` is a bull in a china shop of constitutional values.'' He said the law fails to differentiate among those juveniles likely to embroil themselves in mischief or among those activities most likely to produce harm. `` Just as mere punishment will never cure the drug addict, so mere martial tactics will never wean the district from its addiction to violence and illegal trafficking in drugs,'' <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> declared in a 35-page opinion. The curfew statute would make it illegal for people below age 18 to be on streets in the city from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., with exceptions for teen-agers returning home from work and those traveling with parents. There would be exceptions for youths returning home from school and church-sanctioned functions. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said the law would `` unconstitutionally burden'' the First and Fifth Amendment due process rights of `` thousands of innocent juveniles.'' `` However laudable the objectives which motivated its adoption, the act is invalid on its face and may not be enforced,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his first direct contact with a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader since the advent of student demonstrations, called on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to stop jamming <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and refrain from violence against protesters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who met Tuesday in the Oval Office with <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, also expressed his commitment to strong U.S.-China relations, and the two discussed the recent Soviet-Sino summit, according to a White House statement. Wan then cut short his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trip to rush home to a nation that has been in turmoil since pro-democracy demonstrations spurred thousands of students to rally in the streets of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they expected him to push for the ouster of Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration expects Wan to call a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, which has the authority to impose or revoke martial law, said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The White House statement quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as telling Wan that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is committed to democratic movements and urging <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> not to employ violence. Democracy, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` is the underpinning of our being as a nation. I urge non-violence and restraint in your present situation.'' In an interview with foreign journalists at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that the students who began the protests now have support from workers and said `` it's a fascinating thing that's going on there'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Peaceful change, democracy, is the wave of the future. The students have shown a great deal of courage, and restraint on both sides,'' he said. In his meeting with Wan, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also complained about <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s recent jamming of frequencies used by the U.S.-sponsored <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> to broadcast Mandarin-language programming into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` I urge that Voice of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> not be jammed, and that reporters be given open access,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was quoted as saying. Demonstrators listened to <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> to keep informed during the five weeks of demonstrations. The jamming, which began Monday, was the first since before Sino-U.S. relations were restored in 1979. The Chinese also temporarily blocked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> news organizations from transmitting their broadcasts from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but lifted that ban Tuesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Wan that `` he remains personally committed to expanding the normal and constructive relations the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enjoys with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' according to the White House statement. `` The world has a stake in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic progress, national security, and political vitality. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hopes to see the continuing implementation of economic and political reforms, which undoubtedly will also help advance these goals,'' the statement said. The Chinese embassy characterized Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting, which was also attended by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION>, as `` a broad exchange of views on international issues and Sino-U.S. bilateral relations in a sincere and friendly atmosphere.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> earlier in the day lauded <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for `` going in the right direction'' with its economic liberalization. The <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Wan </PERSON>'s visit, `` for health reasons, will end earlier than scheduled,'' bypassing planned side trips to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> over the next several days. Upon returning to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> was expected to urge the congress to reject use of military force against demonstrators and to formally oust <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. He said use of force against the students could endanger economic ties between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A candidate in the presidential election said he told of massive fraud by both pro- and anti-government parties today during a meeting with a delegation from the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Panamanian government presented its case against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during a meeting Tuesday with the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation, sent in the wake of the nullified election. `` The Panamanian government took the opportunity to present a series of documents and actions that contributed to invalidate the elections of 1989,'' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. An <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> source who refused to be named said the meeting was `` difficult,'' but he did not go into detail. Sources said the delegation was attempting to arrange a meeting with Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief and de facto ruler of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation said they had come to facilitate a search for solutions to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political troubles. Opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two vice presidential candidates were scheduled to meet with the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation. They contend they won the May 7 vote by about 3-to-1 over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s hand-picked candidate. The government, however, nullified the vote, and blamed opposition fraud and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference in the election. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> group met this morning with <PERSON> Hildebrando </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicosia </PERSON>, the Authentic Panamanian Party's presidential candidate. He received only a small percentage of the vote. <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> said he described `` massive fraud committed by both sides.'' He added, `` People are tired of instransigence on both sides. The solution is for negotiations without prior conditions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> approved a resolution last week criticizing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and calling for `` a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.'' It sent a delegation consisting of the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION> as well as <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>. Acting president <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s government said it hoped the mission would `` establish the truth of the crisis as a conflict between <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' and it cited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions as proof of malice. The government has proclaimed it will accept no interference in internal <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> affairs and said some aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> resolution violate the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> charter. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` expounded its points of view about the events that began 24 months ago,'' said <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> in a statement after <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> and members of his cabinet met with the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation. The first street demonstrations against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule began in June of 1987. Since then, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges, charges he says are part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to renege on its commitment to give up the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> at the end of 1999. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation made no comment on the meeting except for Ecuadorean Foreign Minister <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, who said only, `` We have formed no impression.'' At the airport after arriving Tuesday, <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> had said the idea was to assist Panamanians in finding their own solutions and to convey Latin American concern about the situation. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops staged an amphibious landing exercise and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said armed convoys of troops were being dispatched over Panamanian roads with instructions not to stop. Several times in the past <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> police have stopped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> convoys, which they have no right to do, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s student uprising has brought to the surface a long-concealed but intense rivalry for power between <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. In simple terms, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> is the advocate of rapid economic reforms, a liberal whose sympathies lie with the pro-democracy students. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> is the economic conservative who prefers the status quo to risky changes and who ordered martial law rather than give in to student demands. But in Chinese politics, such categorizing can be dangerous and factional rivalries often cross ideological lines. All meetings of the 17-member Politburo, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s top decision-making body, and its core group, the five-man <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, are conducted in secret, and it is impossible to determine how the sides are dividing up in the current showdown Here, however, are a few of the main players: <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 84, has given up his Politburo post and now heads only the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. But he remains the most powerful man in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has won international respect for achieving spectacular economic progress in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with his market-oriented reforms, but politically he is an oldtime revolutionary with little tolerance for dissent. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is believed to be behind <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s decision to crack down on the students and appears to have come out strongly against <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, his longtime protege. It would n't be the first time <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> turned on the man in line to succeed him. Two years ago <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> forced the resignation of party chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, another relative liberal, for failing to subdue student demonstrations. It was <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s death that sparked the current unrest. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> _ <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s head of state, or president, is an octogenarian military man who has been put in the reformist camp because of his close association to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. However, it was <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> who announced that troops would be brought into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and he appears to be firmly behind <PERSON> Li </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON> _ The head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is another solid proponent of reform. But he has long come out second-best to fellow reformer <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, and wo n't necessarily throw his full weight behind <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. Wan may be waiting to move into the void if both <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> fall. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON> <PERSON> _ </PERSON> <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in charge of party propaganda, also is regarded as having reformist sentiments. But he has a reputation of drifting with the political wind and could throw his support to either side. <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON> _ A <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, vice premier and economic expert, <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> is in the conservative camp. <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> _ If the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> splits between the two progressives <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> and the two conservatives <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yao </PERSON>, <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> could be the swing vote. <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON>, who has a history of work in security matters, has rarely made his political views known. Another uncertainty is how much influence senior leaders outside the Politburo will have in deciding <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political future. Although many aging ideological hardliners have relinquished their official posts, some continue to have considerable power because of the personal loyalties they command. Among them are <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yibo </PERSON>, chairman and vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a halfway station for elderly leaders on their way to retirement. If they demand a voice in resolving the political fight, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> could be in trouble.

 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> sent warplanes over Christian-held mountains on a reconnaissance mission Wednesday and its gunners shelled ports north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to keep <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military forces from bringing in supplies. The 11-week-old artillery war between Christian army units and an alliance of Syrians and Druse militiamen has killed at least 359 people, wounded nearly 1,400 and become a leading agenda item at the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. A police spokesman said two MiG-17 jet fighters flew at medium altitude over the mountainous southern flank of the 310-square mile Christian enclave, then headed east toward the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` They did n't attack and the army did n't open fire at them,'' said the spokesman, who can not be identified under standing rules. It was the third such flight in a week, he said, with the apparent purpose of photographing positions of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian forces around <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION>, a resort town southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s men exchanged machine gun fire with the Syrians and Druse in the area. Souk el-Gharb commands a network of roads leading to the Christian enclave and the general's headquarters in the presidential palace at <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> Syrians fired 130mm shells from Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> spradically throughout the day that landed between the Christian ports of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and Byblos without causing casualties, the police spokesman said. He described the military activity as `` part of the daily routine that has been dominating the confrontation since May 11,'' when the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> called a truce in an attempt to end the battles. `` If the summit comes up with resolutions accepted by the general and the Syrians, then the cease-fire will be consolidated and we will have a lasting truce,'' the spokesman said. `` If the summit's resolution on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is rejected by either side, then we'll have another round of violence.'' The truce was declared by an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee that has been trying to end the current fighting and find a solution to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s seat at the summit is vacant because other Arab nations have not recognized either of the rival governments that resulted from a political crisis last September _ <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s and a Moslem cabinet led by Premier <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has said his goal is to drive the Syrians from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and he wants the summit to adopt a supporting resolution. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 and has become the main power broker during the long civil war. The latest fighting began March 8, two days after blockading illegal ports operated by Moslem militias, which deprive the government of about $ 100 million in duties every year. <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s Druse militiamen started shooting in response and Syrian forces soon joined them.

 In a pre-dawn raid today, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers pounded on doors in this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village and took 24 Palestinian suspects away in blindfolds and handcuffs. `` We want to show the local citizens that we are in control,'' said 2nd Lt. <PERSON> Uziyah </PERSON>, 22, a red-bereted paratrooper. An American aid worker said soldiers kicked and slapped some detainees. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, soldiers patrolling <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> on foot said they were shot at today, but no one was hit. It was the second gun attack on Israeli forces in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> in two days. Meanwhile, a military court in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> jailed five Palestinians in connection with a riot in which a Jewish guard accidently shot and killed a 15-year-old Israeli girl. It was an emotional issue involving hikers from a Jewish settlement, which first claimed the girl, <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, was stoned to death by villagers at <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Israelis shot and killed two Palestinians during the April 6, 1988, incident, which began with villagers throwing stones at the hikers. The defendants confessed and were convicted. Haled <PERSON> Hassin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Benishams </PERSON>, 19, was sentenced to four years' jail for forcing the hikers into a violent situation and attempting to stab the guard His three companions were sentenced to terms of 18 months to two years for throwing stones and threatening the hikers. In the Israeli town of <LOCATION> Petah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tikvah </LOCATION>, municipal officials said they plan to build shacks for Arab laborers on the outskirts to discourage them from entering the city. `` It's a catastrophe today. They are walking around everywhere. They use the hallways as toilets,'' said city official <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavi </PERSON>. Left-wing city councilor <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> said he has filed a police complaint against Lev on grounds of racist incitement. `` The danger is ... that this will create a wave of hatred,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikvah </ORGANIZATION> proposal is the latest in a series of restrictions against Palestinian laborers in Israeli towns. Also in past weeks, Israelis have begun stoning <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers, killing one and injuring scores. The violence follows the killing of an Israeli army sergeant blamed on Palestinians. Today's army raids were aimed partly at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> villages that have declared themselves `` liberated'' Palestinian enclaves. More than 30 have been raided since Sunday and scores of Palestinians detained in the crackdown to arrest organizers of the uprising. `` We shake them up with such raids. ... They say ` Hey, the Israelis are here, and we ca n't do anything, not even throw a stone,''' said <PERSON> Uziyah </PERSON>, whose full name could not be used under army regulations. But he said he believes ony a political settlement will end the 17-month revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation that has claimed the lives of 497 Palestinians and 22 Israelis. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Yehtiel </PERSON>, commander of operation in <LOCATION> Husan </LOCATION>, five miles southwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said soldiers do not make indiscriminate arrests and many of those sought are involved in blocking a nearby highway or stoning <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> motorists. Accompanied by several reporters, <PERSON> Uziyah </PERSON>'s squad pounded on the door of a single-story stone house. `` Open the door!'' he shouted in Arabic as soldiers with automatic rifles flanked him. The house belonged to a man suspected of belonging to the Moslem fundamentalist <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION>. No one was home. But soldiers went into the house next door, belonging to the suspect's father, farmer <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Taha </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s wife screamed at soldiers who barged into her living room and demanded identity cards from three of her sons. She complained they already have arrested one. `` This is the third time you have searched this house. You are besieging us!'' said the middle-aged woman. The soldiers left when they failed to find the man on their list. Twenty-four Palestinians arrested earlier were lined up in <LOCATION> Husan </LOCATION> secondary school, blindfolded with hands bound behind their backs. On one wall, a large Israeli star of <PERSON> David </PERSON> emblem had been painted with a swastika inside. Four Arabs were freed after questioning and the rest taken away in a bus. None showed signs of beatings, and soldiers said they did not use night sticks because the detainees did not resist arrest. In another pre-dawn raid today, however, aid worker <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said he saw several people `` yelled at or kicked.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 35, who works for Save the Children, was detained for three hours with about 300 Palestinians after soldiers raided his apartment overlooking <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Amari </PERSON> refugee camp. When he protested after a soldier kicked a young Palestinian three times, `` I was told to shut up,'' he said. He said an elderly man was slapped in the face and kicked in the back after he complained of leg cramps.

 A teen-ager who says she had sex with Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> testified today she appeared uninvited at his home with a 19-year-old girlfriend and that the three of them climbed into bed together. <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said she met <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and did not see the 58-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> again until Nov. 6, when she and <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> visited him. `` My friend <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> gave me a call. She said she had met a congressman. She called him by the name of ` <PERSON> Buz </PERSON>,''' Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' nickname. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said the two took a cab to <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' Columbus apartment. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> met them at the door in boxer shorts and gave Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> a $ 20 bill to pay the driver, Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> was 16 and Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> 19. `` I said ` Do you remember me?' He said ` Yes.' ... He said ` Nice to see you again,''' Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> shook his head repeatedly during her testimony. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> showed the two around his apartment and took them to a guest room. `` He told us to get undressed and put on ... two black robes,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said. She asked him why they could not wear two white robes she saw in the room. `` He said those were for white people ... other kind of people,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> are black. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> is white. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> testified that they got into bed with <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>. `` He started talking nasty,'' she said. The judge recessed the trial until the afternoon to let Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> regain her composure. The congressman is on trial on a charge of contributing to the unruliness or delinquency of a minor for allegedly having sex with the girl one day before she turned 17. If convicted of the misdemeanor, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, who is divorced, could receive six months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. Before Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> testified, defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyack </PERSON> attacked the testimony of the girl's mother, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, and tried to depict the woman as continually unemployed and desperate for notoriety and money. Also today, Domestic Relations Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solove </PERSON> ruled that Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>'s juvenile record is not admissable. During cross-examination, <PERSON> Tyack </PERSON> suggested that Mrs. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> was lying when she said her daughter did not tell her she was going to <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' apartment. He presented evidence she had told police and TV station <ORGANIZATION> WSYX </ORGANIZATION> that her daughter did tell her. `` You knew where she was going and you did n't try to stop her,'' <PERSON> Tyack </PERSON> charged. `` I did not know the place she was going,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> also said she was paid $ 1,500 for an interview with a local TV show. She previously testified <ORGANIZATION> WSYX </ORGANIZATION> paid for a two-day stay at a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> hotel. Mrs. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> contacted <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> and confronted him during a meeting at a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> fast-food restaurant that was secretly videotaped by WSYX. The 50-minute tape, in which <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was barely audible, was shown to the jury Tuesday. `` I told him how old she was,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said, adding she showed <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> pictures of the girl. `` It did n't bother him a bit because apparently he's been doing that all along.'' She said <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> told her he thought her daughter was 18. Mrs. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> testified Tuesday that she took her story to <ORGANIZATION> WSYX </ORGANIZATION> because <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> `` should be exposed for what he was.'' `` A person with his power should not be in office,'' she testified. She said she also called <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 to discuss `` him contributing to her delinquency by getting her intoxicated'' and told him the girl was 13.

 Soldiers on Wednesday worked to clear the wreckage of a speeding passenger train that derailed, killing eight people and injuring 59 when six of its cars tumbled into a ravine, officials said. The 15-car train derailed Tuesday night in northern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> as it rounded a bend at 47 mph, but should have been traveling no faster than 28 mph, said <PERSON> Phairot </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotjalermngam </PERSON>, spokesman for the State Railways of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The train was heading from <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> when the accident occurred in <LOCATION> Phrae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, about 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. Tourists from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> were among those reported hurt. The Chiang Mai-Bangkok train is usually packed and is often taken by foreign tourists. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Larter </PERSON> and his girlfriend, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, said they were injured when their car fell into the ravine. `` I felt a crunch and then the carriage rolled and people just flew,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, 24. `` I ended up sitting on a fan on the roof and there were people underneath me.'' Three of the cars were piled on top of each other, trapping passengers, she said. `` It was pitch black and we could n't see anything,'' said <PERSON> Larter </PERSON>, 29. `` The thing we were most worried about was being hit by another train, as we did n't realize we were right at the bottom of the ravine.'' It was two hours before rescue teams reached the thickly forested area, he said. Villagers brought candles, food and medicine. Soldiers of the 3rd Army Region helped move some of the wreckage.

Needs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Nearly one American household in three has money left after paying taxes and normal household expenditures, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. This `` discretionary income'' was reported for 28.9 percent of all households as of March 1987, the agency said. That's slightly better than the 28.3 percent of households reporting discretionary income four years earlier. And those households with discretionary income also had more money left in 1987 than in 1983, with the spending money rising from $ 11,032 to $ 12,332 over that period. The report, `` A Marketer's Guide to Discretionary Income,'' was prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit business information service in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The report is compiled primarily for sales and marketing officials interested in how consumers spend money. The increase in the number of households with discretionary income, and the level of that income, means that the amount Americans had in hand for spending beyond basic needs rose from $ 262 billion in 1983 to $ 319 billion in 1987, according to the report. This change reflects the improved economic conditions, the report said, noting that an economic recession was under way in the early years of the 1980s. In addition, the report said the increasing number of working wives added to the discretionary income available for many households. Education makes a significant difference, the report said, with 59.6 percent of families headed by someone with at least five years of college having excess income. By comparison, 24.5 percent of households headed by a high school graduate had discretionary income, and the rate was only 11.3 percent for those headed by someone who had not finished high school. By age, households headed by someone 55 to 59 were most likely to have discretionary funds, at 35 percent. Close were those aged 35 to 39 at 33 percent. The least likely to have extra money were households headed by someone aged 15 to 24, at 18.7 percent. Likelihood of having discretionary income varied slightly by household size, ranging from 30.9 percent of two-person households to 26.4 percent of those with six or more people. As might be expected, the higher the household income, the more likely there was to be some leftover money. Among households with incomes under $ 15,000, only 0.7 percent had any discretionary income. The share with excess money climbed to 21.5 percent in the $ 25,000 to $ 29,999 income bracket. Households with incomes of $ 75,000 and more all reported having discretionary income. The report was based on the Current Population Survey, which covers about 60,000 households across the country. After-tax income was calculated and then compared to a series of household budgets for various family sizes that had been calculated by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. That comparison was used to determine the share of households with money left after covering their basic needs.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> were comrades at arms once, half a globe apart at a time when the world was at war. In the spring of 1944, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not quite 20, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer and an aviator in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> was 31, an Army private from <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and an infantryman in the 3rd Division's bloody drive on <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will visit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military cemetery at <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION>, row after row of white marble headstones set in gentle arcs on a manicured lawn. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> is one of 7,862 soldiers buried there, near the spot where he fell on May 28, 1944. `` They represent about 35 percent of those killed in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> and the advance on <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON>, a retired soldier and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who became the cemetery's superintendent two months ago. The bodies ofmost of those killed in the invasion at <LOCATION> Anzio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION> were returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the request of next of kin. The names of 3,094 others still missing or buried at sea are carved in the white <PERSON> Carrara </PERSON> marble walls of a memorial at the end of a long grassy mall. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will lay a wreath, but officials say his brief Memorial Day weekend remarks will focus on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, not the war. Still, <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> says the visit is an honor, a way to acknowledge so many like <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> whose sacrifice is remembered usually only by friends or family. Some families paid a higher price. There are 21 pairs of brothers buried at <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION>, most of them side by side. Two, Cpl. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaspervick </PERSON> and 2nd Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaspervick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Quincy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, died 10 days apart in January 1944. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is coming to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> on his way to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, which marks the alliance's 40th anniversary. During his European swing, he also will meet with <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and political leaders in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. His most public appearance in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> will be the stop at the 77-acre military cemetery near where Allied troops waded ashore at 2 a.m. on Jan. 22, 1944. Allied commanders hoped the bold stroke would relieve the fierce stalemate at <LOCATION> Cassino </LOCATION> to the south and hasten the fall of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, 45 miles to the north. The battle-hardened British 1st and American 3rd, the first divisions ashore, expected heavy resistance but were almost unopposed. The astonished Allies had caught the Germans by surprise. `` It was so easy ... American troops are standing with their mouths open and shaking their heads in utter amazement,'' <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> wrote at the time. But while the Allies secured the beachhead, crack German divisions fortified the heights beyond the shore. The bold stroke was lost in a nightmare of rain, wind, mud, blood and high explosive. There were 3,000 American casualties in January. A German counterattack pushed the Allies toward the sea. Then it became a static war, three months of withering artillery barrages. In the soldier's black humor it was simply called the `` Sitzkrieg.'' The breakout finally came in May. On June 4, after 123 days of fighting, the Allies entered <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. The cemetery lies along the 3rd Division's path up from the beach. <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> said it opened as a temporary cemetery two days after the landings. `` There were Germans and Britons as well as Americans buried here at first,'' he said. `` It was in the middle of the fighting.''

 Forcing a son to call his mother and visit her is no business of the courts, a judge ruled. The ruling Tuesday grew out of a dispute between <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, a retired teacher. The son, who is in his early 40s, filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction to stop her from calling him and his wife. Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> issued the injunction in 1985 but ordered the son to telephone his mother at least once every three months and meet with her once a year. The judge later dropped those requirements, but did order the son to keep his mother informed of where he lives.

 The tractor-trailer belches black smoke as it rumbles up a mountainous pass, leaving behind a gritty landscape obscured by gray haze: the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> basin at high noon. `` There's a good one,'' says <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol Officer <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Dettinger </PERSON> and the smog patrol is off and chasing yet another 18-wheeled contributor to <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s choking smog. In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CHP </ORGANIZATION> `` Smokeys'' are living up to their nickname by pulling over the puffing tailpipes as well as the speeders. `` We pull people over on the freeway and other people will go by and blow their horns and give the thumbs up,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who is in charge of the patrols. As <PERSON> Dettinger </PERSON> was writing a citation, trucker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> conceded, `` Something has to be done, there's no doubt about it.'' Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s skies are the most polluted in the nation _ a result of surrounding mountains that trap the filth along with stagnant weather and industries that operate in the area. The agency responsible for reducing the pollution, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, took part of its cleanup effort last yearto the streets by dispatching highway patrol officers to stop polluting vehicles and issue orders to clean up or pay up. Drivers can join the crackdown by calling a hotline to report the license numbers of smoking vehicles. The culprits are sent stern letters and must provide proof the problem is fixed. The air quality district has found people are eager to help clean up the air by reporting others. More than 7,200 people phoned the smog hotline to report smoking cars in March, said spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. The district's territory extends over 13,600 square miles from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, 110 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, then north to the <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> line and south to where <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> meets <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. An estimated 11 million people live in the district, which encompasses <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> counties and non-desert areas of the vast <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> alone, there are 5.4 million licensed drivers. All that exhaust contributed to ozone levels that exceeded federal health standards 176 days in 1988. <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s air is so fouled that in March, the agency proposed a drastic change in driving habits. Under the plan, 40 percent of non-commerical and 70 percent of vehicles would be required by 1998 to run on methanol, fuel cells or electricity rather than on gasoline. Unlike the high-level ozone layer, which filters the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation, low-level ozone is dangerous The pale-blue gas formed by a chemical reaction involving nitrogen dioxide and hydrocarbons is one of the principal components of smog. Vehicle exhaust is believed to cause up to 8 percent of lung cancer in non-smoking urban residents. Research has shown ozone aggravates respiratory ailments in children, the elderly and people suffering from heart and lung diseases. It eats away at tires and nylon, damages crops and has damaged the lungs of animals used in experiments. Since July, when the program became full time, eight officers driving cars marked with the winged-dove logo of the air quality district have written more than 8,000 citations to smoking vehicles, mostly diesel trucks. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Crape </PERSON>, a state engineer who works in <LOCATION> Chino </LOCATION>, carries a tape recorder to take down license numbers of polluting vehicles. `` I turned in about 120 already,'' he said. `` We ca n't let it keep going, because what is it going to be like when the population doubles, triples? What? Are we going to wear gas masks?''

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has agreed to impose ceilings on Soviet forces stationed in East European countries, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said today. In a parallel move, the officials said, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested that no country _ including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ be allowed to have more than 35 percent to 40 percent of the combined manpower totals of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. This would have the effect of diluting the forces of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and overall, as well. The proposals were the latest in a series of arms control initiatives by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> welcomed them today. `` The Soviets are now being forthcoming and we hope to achieve the reductions that we seek,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a commencement speech at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. But he added: `` These reductions alone, even if implemented, are not enough to eliminate the superiority the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> enjoys now'' in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The twin moves by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were in response to longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for reducing a large <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> edge over the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in non-nuclear strength. For instance, Soviet tanks now account for nearly 70 percent of all <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact armor. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> sought to play down the importance of the latest <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal, saying it was a response to a plan proposed last March 9 by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` The Soviets have provided details in a meaningful way at the negotiating table. It is a serious proposal and we look forward to the negotiations.'' And <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said `` we view this as a serious and substantial proposal that is being received as such.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s overture came less than a week before <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> holds a summit meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> attended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the leaders of the 15 other Western governments. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Soviets had also offered to reduce <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> tank and armored personnel carriers to just above <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> levels. Specifically, the Soviets said they would reduce their tank total by 17,580 and personnel carriers by about 27,000, the officials said. The Soviet position was outlined by Soviet negotiators in a closed meeting Tuesday in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials. It was an elaboration of the cuts <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had told Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> about two weeks ago in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In exchange for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> reductions, the Soviets offered to cut <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks by 40,000, combat aircraft by 42,000, and artillery pieces by 47,000. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has somewhat different totals in each category. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also proposed a reduction of 1 million troops in both alliances and a 55 percent cutback in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s combat aircraft. By 1997, there would be equal levels of 1.35 million troops in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, 1,500 strike aircraft, 20,000 tanks, 1,700 helicopters, 24,000 artillery pieces and 28,000 combat vehicles. The two alliances opened negotiations in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in February with the aim of reducing non-nuclear forces across the vast expanse of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> in the West to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Besides seeking overall <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> reductions, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies for years have tried to persuade the Soviets to impose limits both on the forces they keep in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, and ceilings on each of the allies' troops. These include <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, which are also members of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>.

 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commencement address Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. I want to congratulate each member of this year's class on receiving your commission into such a proud service. You mention the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and most people think about lives saved at sea, daring rescue operations. But those daily acts of heroism are just one part of the vital work that this Coast Guard performs. Right now, in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> continues to work around the clock in a major environmental cleanup. And let me, at this point, on behalf of a grateful nation, commend Admiral <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, through his personal commitment, his involvement and the leadership that he has shown. He has served his country in the finest tradition of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. And those of us who care about the environment _ and that is 250 million Americans, at a minimum _ he's showing us the way, and your service, backing him up in every way. And I am very proud of what <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> has done. -LRB- Applause. -RRB- Right now, off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrols are chasing down drug smugglers, helping to keep the drugs off the streets. And that may be all in a day's work for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, but it is absolutely vital to our national health, our well-being and our security. I'm sure, on that long first day of swab summer, that you never thought four years could pass so quickly. But they have, and you've worked hard. Billet night has come and gone, and you're ready _ <PERSON> Semper </PERSON> <PERSON> Paratus </PERSON>, in the words of your motto _ ready to enter the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s service, to enter the world. And the truth is, that's what commencement is all about. The world is yours. And today's ceremony is really part of the change of command from one generation to the next. Today, our world, your world, is changing, East and West. And today, I want to speak to you about the world we want to see and what we can do to bring that new world into clear focus. We live in a time when we are witnessing the end of an idea: the final chapter of the communist experiment. Communism is now recognized, even by many within the communist world itself, as a failed system, one that promised economic prosperity but failed to deliver the goods; a system that built a wall between the people and their political aspirations. But the eclipse of communism is only one-half of the story of our time. The other is the ascendancy of the democratic idea. Never before has the idea of freedom so captured the imaginations of men and women the world over. And never before has the hope of freedom beckoned so many: trade unionists in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, rulers consulting the ruled in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And even as we speak today, the world is transfixed by the dramatic events in Tiananmen Square. Everywhere those voices are speaking the language of democracy and freedom, and we hear them, and the world hears them. And <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will do all it can to encourage them.

 Many scientists at a workshop set up to investigate cold fusion say they will keep looking for evidence of the process, but nearly all of them say they have seen no sign yet it exists. The workshop on the claims of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> chemist <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and his British colleague, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, has brought together an estimated 500 physicists and chemists with a wide variety of theories. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> startled the scientific world with the announcement two months ago that they had achieved cold fusion in a simple experiment using a palladium electrode and water made with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. The conventional belief was that fusion as an energy source could be attained only at high temperatures and by applying high power. The announcement has been the subjects of several conferences around the country, including the three-day workshop here. The workshop, sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, concludes Thursday. `` There seems to be an intense scientific interest in the possibility that a nuclear reaction takes place in a so-far unanticipated site,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackerman </PERSON>, retired professor of chemistry at Rice and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> universities. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> ignored the opportunity to attend the workshop and defend their claims. They also canceled a meeting with <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> officials who want to give them $ 5 million for their research. The observations at the conference included many like those of physicist <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. He flatly rejected the Pons-Fleischmann assertions. Hopeful commentary came from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> chemist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleby </PERSON>. He suggested that fusion has sometimes occurred in his team's experiment. <PERSON> Appleby </PERSON> declined to say in an interview that fusion occurred in the Pons-Fleischmann experiments. If it is fusion, he said, it is not occurring in the usual way. Fusion is a process in which light atoms combine to form heavier elements, releasing energy. <PERSON> Appleby </PERSON>'s encouraging findings included the discovery of large amounts of tritium in the heavy water solution, along with a small number of neutrons. Tritium can be a product of fusion. He also described different heat measurements using different solutions, such as a lithium-based bath and a sodium solution that shut down all reactions. `` We do n't know what's going on, but it is not chemistry,'' <PERSON> Appleby </PERSON> said. `` There's a lot of confusion, rather than fusion, going on.'' <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON>, a physicist with the <ORGANIZATION> Ruder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boskovic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, said he found the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> claims `` difficult to believe.'' But he proclaimed much of the theoretical physics presented at the workshop `` positive'' and headed in the right direction.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today welcomed new arms reduction proposals by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> but said they were `` not enough'' to redress the edge <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> forces maintain over <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He also challenged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to disclose accurate figures on Soviet military spending. `` Open the ledger,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a commencement address to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. Speaking only a day after the Soviet leader offered to impose new limits on troops stationed in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and on Soviet forces overall, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` The Soviets are now being forthcoming and we hope to achieve the reductions that we seek.'' However, he said, `` these reductions alone, even if implemented, are not enough to eliminate the superiority the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> enjoys now.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared communism `` a failed system'' and said the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was entering a new era based on economic and political success. `` There is an opportunity before us to shape a new world,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He took note of the pro-democracy demonstrators who have occupied <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square for more than 10 days and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will do all it can to encourage'' those who `` are speaking the language of democracy and freedom.'' He wished <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> success in attempting to restructure the Soviet economy and said lasting peace was now more likely than ever before. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it still was necessary to maintain a strong nuclear deterrence with a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> long-range mobile missile and making other ocean-spanning land-based missiles transportable. `` We live in a time when we are witnessing the end of an idea _ the final chapter of the Communist experiment,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He called Communism `` a failed system, one that promised economic prosperity but failed to deliver the goods, a system that built a wall between the people and their political aspirations.'' He urged further reductions by the Soviet-led alliance and reiterated his call for territorial overflights on both sides. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also played on the theme of open markets in his speech and said `` if we succeed, the next decade, and the century beyond, will be an era of unparalleled growth.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said success also required an end to conflict and turmoil. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies were pursuing a strategy of strength, economically, diplomatically and militarily. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the president said, a dramatic process is unfolding. `` Make no mistake, our policy is to seize every _ and I mean every _ opportunity to build a better and more stabile relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' He said `` we want to see perestroika -LRB- economic restructuring -RRB- succeed'' as well as the policy of openness, known as glasnost. White House aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected a prepared text and added new sections hours before he was to speak. A <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> session <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is attending in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> next Monday and Tuesday with the leaders of 15 other Western governments is likely to be dominated by how to respond to a series of arms control initiatives by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had made proposals to impose ceilings on Soviet forces stationed in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as well as outlining possible reductions in Soviet conventional arms. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the latest <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposal represented the first time the Soviets had agreed to an overall ceiling on conventional forces. `` We find this very promising,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` These are major, major concessions that put them more in line with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal.'' National Security Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had given Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> a general description of the Soviet proposal during <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> earlier this month but that `` they were vague. Now they've put more meat on it.'' Scowcroft, who accompanied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> academy, told reporters the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal `` looks like a serious proposal and we will treat it as a serious proposal. We will look at it.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview with <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> journalists released today that new Soviet proposals for reducing conventional forces would be helpful, but it would be reckless for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> `` to lay down our weapons and turn them into plowshares.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also expressed interest in a possible visit to Communist-ruled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Asked what it would take to get him to make such a trip, the president said: `` First, an invitation.'' Addressing the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> graduates, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` never before has the idea of freedom so captured the imaginations of men and women the world over _ and never before has the hope of freedom beckoned so many. `` Trade unioninsts in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Rulers consulting the ruled in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And even as we speak today, the world is transfixed by the dramatic events in Tiananmen Square. `` Everywhere those voices are speaking the language of democracy and freedom. And we hear them. And the world hears them. And <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will do all it can to encourage them.'' In the interview with <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> journalists, he said that the massive protests in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and political reform movements in other parts of the world show `` the democratic way is on the march and it is not going to be stopped.'' Still, the president cautioned, `` I'm old enough to remember <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in 1956 and I do n't want to be a catalyst for encouraging a course of action that would inevitably lead to violence and bloodshed.'' He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s recent offers, in reality, were no more than responses to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposals `` and then it's reported as though this is an enormous step forward ... So we need a little light in all of this.'' And, while giving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader points for public relations, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, `` You do not make foreign policy based on the personality or charm of an individual in another country. You do it on facts.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated in the interview, with reporters from news organizations from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, that a compromise with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on short-range missiles might not be possible before the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit that begins on Monday. `` I have felt that we can resolve this issue before we get to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. I'm not sure now, but we'll keep working the problem,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Despite a transatlantic flurry of proposals and counterproposals over the past few days, there is no agreement on proposed superpower talks to reduce short-range missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has called for such talks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes them, at least while Soviet-bloc nations retain an advantage in tanks and troops. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to reporters from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Messaggero </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s The Guardian, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standaard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Frankfurter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allgemeine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION>

 The thousands of youths camped in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> are only the most visible portion of an increasingly radicalized student population that is organizing for a long-term political struggle. They plan to keep working for reforms, such as a free press and an end to widespread official corruption, regardless of whether <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> reformers win a power struggle with conservatives. `` If we get our immediate goals _ including a dialogue with the government _ we will calm down a bit and be able to study. But our movement wo n't be over,'' said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhangbao </PERSON>, an activist at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. On his and other <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> campuses, students who did not join or who left the 12-day-old Tiananmen sit-in were collecting supplies for the students in the square, printing leaflets and speading word on the streets of their reform movement. Some read announcements and speeches into loudspeaker networks that now extend off-campus. Others kept an eye on the movements of troops who were ordered Saturday to impose martial law in the city center but were blocked on the outskirts by crowds of students and supporters. Some students worked shifts on traffic control units around the square. Some made posters. What the students were n't doing was going to class. `` We're still studying on our own, but ... we're pretty busy working for the movement,'' said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, a Chinese literature major who admits he has n't cracked a book in a while. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> works in his campus' `` propaganda department'' of what students have come to call simply `` the movement'' _ short for `` the patriotic student democracy movement.'' Each campus also has a secretariat, logistics department and reception department for greeting out-of-town students coming to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to join the movement. One big project has been organizing four teams of about 500 students each from <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to take turns sitting in the square for 12-hour shifts, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said. Other schools have organized similar teams. `` We have to ensure that the students get some rest,'' he said. `` The government could delay for several weeks'' in responding to student terms for leaving the square: the resignation of Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, an end to martial law and a dialogue with the government on reform. The hall in <LOCATION> Chen </LOCATION>'s dormitory is piled with food and clothing donated by local residents for the protesters in the square. The sit-in began May 13 with a hunger strike by about 2,000 students, grew to include about 70,000 students and thousands more supporters, then shrank over the weekend after the hunger strike ended. The students plan to continue the sit-in to dramatize their demands, but say it is not their only focus. Thousands have volunteered to go to factories and residential areas to hand out leaflets and lead political discussions. `` We want to reach as broad an audience as possible,'' said <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaojun </PERSON>, a 25-year-old math student who sat at a picnic table with a map of the city in front of him, signing up students. <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students also have organized `` propaganda teams,'' said activist <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Xieli </PERSON>. When the student movement began April 15 with the death of a leading reformer, former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, only a few student leaders were able to articulate the reasons for their dissatisfaction with the government. But the shared experiences of the past six weeks, including dramatic confrontations with police and exhiliarating marches joined by hundreds of thousands of local residents, have politicized the student population. Many say they wo n't return to the relatively drab routine of a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> college student, which allows little opportunity for individual initiative. `` When we leave the square that does n't mean we will have finished the struggle,'' Ma said, even if the students succeed in forcing a change of government. `` Our chief goal is n't for this or that person to resign but to speed up the progress of democracy.'' `` Regardless of what faction takes power, it will seek to destroy our movement,'' said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>. `` The party and government have to think of their own interests. `` Democracy and freedom and science can not be accomplished in one or two years,'' he said. `` We can only struggle stage by stage. I am willing to keep working, and I hope the next generation of students will too.''

<TEXT>
 So today, I want to speak about our security strategy for the 1990s, one that advances American ideals and upholds American aims. Amidst the many challenges we'll face, there will be risks. But let me assure you, we'll find more than our share of opportunities. We and our allies are strong _ stronger, really, than at any point in postwar period, and more capable than ever of supporting the cause of freedom. There's an opportunity before us to shape a new world. What is it that we want to see? It is a growing community of democracies anchoring international peace and stability, and a dynamic free market system generating prosperity and progress on a global scale. The economic foundation of this new era is the proven success of the free market, and nurturing that foundation are the values rooted in freedom and democracy. Our country, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, was founded on these values, and they gave us the confidence that flows from strength. So let's be clear about one thing. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> looks forward to the challenge of an emerging global market, but these values are not ours alone. They are now shared by our friends and allies around the globe. The economic rise of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the nations of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> rim is the growing success of our postwar policy. This time is a time of tremendous opportunity, and destiny is in our own hands. To reach the world we want to see, we've got to work, and work hard. There's a lot of work ahead of us. We must resolve international trade problems that threaten to pit friends and allies against one another. We must combat misguided notions of economic nationalism that will tell us to close off our economies to foreign competition just when the global marketplace has become a fact of life. We must open the door to the nations of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and other socialist countries that embrace free market reforms. And finally, for developing nations heavily burdened with debt, we must provide assistance and encourage the market reforms that will set those nations on a path towards growth. If we succeed, the next decade and the century beyond will be an era of unparalleled growth, an era which sees the flourishing of freedom, peace and prosperity around the world. But this new era can not unfold in a climate where conflict and turmoil exist, and therefore, our goals must also include security and stability. Security for fully _ security and stability. Security _ this text is going crazy on this machine here _ -LRB- laughter -RRB-. Security for ourselves and our allies and our friends, stability in the international arena, and in the end to regional conflicts. Such goals are constant, but the strategy we employ to reach them can and must change as the world changes. Today the need for a dynamic and adaptable strategy is imperative. We must be strong economically, diplomatically, and as you know, militarily, to take advantage of the opportunities open to us in a world of rapid change. And nowhere will the ultimate consequences of change have more significance for world security than within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> itself. What we're seeing now in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is indeed dramatic. The process is still ongoing, unfinished. But make no mistake, our policy is to seize every _ and I mean every _ opportunity to build a better, more stable relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, just as it is our policy to defend American interests in light of the enduring reality of Soviet military power. We want to see perestroika succeed, and we want to see the policies of glasnost and perestroika _ so far a revolution imposed from top down _ institutionalized within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 The Cold War is over, but global security now is threatened by the buildup of ballistic missiles in developing countries, a research institute said Wednesday in an annual report. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> also raised doubts about whether Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will succeed with his reforms, or even survive. `` While skepticism about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s sincerity was subsiding among Western leaders, questions about his ability to succeed, and even to stay in power, abound,'' said the report. `` Open opposition and challenges have been replaced with grumbling beneath the surface,'' it said. `` This does not necessarily make <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s situation any less dangerous.'' <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Heisbourg </PERSON> told a news conference that 1988 was `` the year in which the Cold War ended.'' `` We move from a highly polarized and very threatening world ... -LRB- into one -RRB- which will be much less stable, much more messy, albeit with a much more relaxed East-West relationship,'' <PERSON> Heisbourg </PERSON> said. On the proliferation of missiles, including those capable of carrying nuclear warheads, the survey said that within the last two years, new ballistic missile programs have been revealed throughout the Third World posing `` global risks.'' `` In all, more than 20 developing countries have ballistic missiles programs,'' said the survey. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have several missile development programs, while <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> each have highly secret missile programs, the survey said. It also listed <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> among 21 developing countries known to have acquired ballistic missiles. `` While no developing country except <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> appears capable of producing an intercontinental weapon before the end of the century, space-launch vehicles under development in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> could form the basis for long-range missiles in the future,'' the survey said. Arsenals of other developing countries varied from the Soviet-made, 44-mile range Frog-7 held by <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, to sophisticated weapons with ranges of more than 1,242 miles acquired by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last year and being developed domestically by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the survey said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Agni missile will reportedly be capable of having a range of 1,550 miles, the survey said. `` Missiles of such range are difficult to justify unless they carry nuclear weapons,'' it added. The most common ballistic missile in the Third World was the Soviet Scud-B, with a 175-mile range, it said. These missiles were used in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and during the Iran-Iraq war. The survey said the U.S.-led <ORGANIZATION> Missile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regime </ORGANIZATION>, signed by seven Western nations in 1987, appeared merely to have slowed some missile programs, but not halted the proliferation. `` Countries like <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> have had to postpone launch schedules and redouble their domestic research effort,'' said the survey. `` Other countries, such as <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, have moved to take advantage of unlicensed, black-market technology. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s domestic research and development is so far advanced that it is, in effect, immune.

<HEAD>Powers, Duties of New Soviet Congress Still Uncertain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The exact powers and duties of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> remain uncertain as reformers scrambled Wednesday to unite forces and promote their own agendas. Under political reforms championed by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that created the congress, the 2,250-member body is supposed to meet once a year to elect a smaller, working legislature and a handful of top officials, including the Soviet president. But progressive deputies are demanding the congress debate the country's critical problems, including the economy and environment, and human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has even called for it to supersede the smaller legislature, the Supreme Soviet, as the chief law-making organ. The exact role the congress assumes for itself wo n't be known until the deputies gather at the Kremlin Palace of Congresses. As foreseen in the laws and constitutional amendments that created the congress, its duties include: _ Electing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> president, who will assume more power. The president will be in charge of general administration of the country and will chair the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, make proposals to the Supreme Soviet, negotiate with foreign countries and sign treaties and make laws. _ Electing from among its members the the 542-member Supreme Soviet. That body will meet for two four-month terms yearly as the country's working legislature. _ Making changes in the Soviet Constitution. _ Reviewing the president's choice for premier, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the prosecutor-general. Among the new parliamentarians who will convene Thursday morning at the Kremlin for the inaugural session of the congress, there are: _ 750 deputies elected by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> voters from geographical districts of equal population throughout the country. _ 750 deputies elected by voters to represent the 15 constituent Soviet republics as well as the autonomous territories and regions that are official homelands for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s more than 100 ethnic groups. _ 750 deputies directly chosen by officially sanctioned organizations ranging from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, labor unions and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> to the national associations of booklovers and stamp collectors.

 And we want to see perestroika extended as well. We want to see a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that restructures its relationship toward the rest of the world, a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that is a force for constructive solutions to the world's problems. The grand strategy of the West during the postwar period has been based on the concept of containment _ checking the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s expansionist aims in the hope that the Soviet system itself would one day be forced to confront its internal contradictions. The ferment in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today affirms the wisdom of this strategy. And now, we have a precious opportunity to move beyond containment. You are graduating into an exciting world where the opportunity for peace, world peace, lasting peace, has never been better. Our goal _ integrating the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the community of nations is every bit as ambitious as containment was at its time, and it holds tremendous promise for international stability. Coping with a changing <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be a challenge of the highest order, but the security challenges we face today do not come from the East alone. The emergence of regional powers is rapidly changing the strategic landscape. In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, in our own hemisphere, a growing number of nations are acquiring advanced and highly destructive capabilties, in some cases, weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. And it is an unfortunate fact that the world faces increasing threats from armed insurgencies, terrorists, and as you in the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> are well aware, narcotics traffickers; and in some regions, an unholy alliance of all three. Our task is clear: We must curb the proliferation of advanced weaponry. We must check the aggressive ambitions of renegade regimes. And we must enhance the ability of our friends to defend themselves. We have not yet mastered the complex challenge. We and our allies must construct a common strategy for stability in the developing world. How we and our allies deal with these diverse challenges depends on how well we understand the key elements of defense strategy. So let me just mention today two points in particular: First, the need for an effective deterrent, one that demonstrates, to our allies and adversaries alike, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> strength, American resolve. And second, the need to maintain an approach to arms reduction that promotes stability at the lowest feasible level of armaments. Deterrence is central to our defense strategy. The key to keeping the peace is convincing our adversaries that the cost of aggression against us or our allies is simply unacceptable. In today's world, nuclear forces are essential to deterrence. Our challenge is to protect those deterrent systems from attack. And that's why we'll move Peacekeeper ICBMs out of fixed and vulnerable silos, making them mobile, and thus harder to target. Looking to the longer term, we will also develop and deploy a new highly mobile single-warhead missile, the Midgetman. With only minutes of warning, these new missiles can relocate out of harm's way. Any attack against systems like this will fail. And we're also researching, and we're committed to deploy when ready, a more comprehensive defensive system, known as SDI. Our premise is straightforward: Defense against incoming missiles endangers no person, endangers no country. We're also working to reduce the threat we face, both nuclear and conventional.

 A federal judge on Wednesday told lawyers squabbling over a planned marijuana rally in <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> to agree on a site suitable for the crowd expected or risk a court order. `` I hate to issue an order requiring the town to use one of those fields,'' Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> told attorneys for the city of <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and for the rally organizers. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> denied a permit to a marijuana law reform group that wanted to stage a May 28 rally in <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The group advocates decriminalizing marijuana. The commission argued that city parks could not accommodate the 3,000 people that the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannabis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> said it expected for the rally. `` It's not who they are,'' commission Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> said. `` The only thing I'm interested in is protecting the city's fields. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, an attorney representing the coalition, filed a complaint May 15 alleging that the group's constitutional rights to free speech and assembly were being violated. `` The plaintiffs are residents of <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> who wish simply to exercise their rights to a meeting on a serious topic of interest, both nationally and locally,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. He called the crowd estimate of 2,000 to 3,000 people `` a little optimistic'' and said plaintiffs would be willing to accept a limit of 1,000 people at the rally.

 A man told police he killed a fellow veteran who tried to prevent him from committing suicide. `` I wish it had been me instead of him,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Papineau </PERSON>, 40, who was arraigned as a fugitive Tuesday. He is charged in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> with murdering <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Thibeault </PERSON>, who was shot to death in the woods in <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Papineau </PERSON> was arrested Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Northampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a psychiatric facility where he had been held to determine whether he could stand trial on unrelated charges of assaulting his former wife and girlfriend.

 The largest and longest study yet on the anti-aging effects of Retin-A confirms that the acne cream does smooth wrinkles, but reducing doses apparently reduces its effectiveness, researchers say. `` There is no question that the more you use, the more you improve,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. `` In those people who used the strongest doses, what we saw was a decrease in fine wrinkling, in roughness and in uneven coloring.'' The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> found a year ago that Retin-A _ a synthetic form of Vitamin A known as tretinoin, long used to treat acne _ dramatically reduced the ravages of aging and sun damage in a short-term study of about 30 people. Since then, nationwide studies have been under way on how well it works and whether it is safe. The federal government has yet to approve it for this use, but it's available by prescription from physicians. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> issued a strong statement condemning indiscriminate use of Retin-A to treat wrinkles. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> has said there is no conclusive evidence the drug reduces wrinkles. `` Long-term animal studies and well-controlled clinical trials involving larger numbers of patients in various age groups are needed to assess the risks and benefits,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> study used a high dose of the drug and patients suffered significant known side effects of Retin-A, peeling, burning, redness and overall irritation of the skin. A six-month study of more than 300 patients last year at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> used lower and varying doses of the drug to learn whether side effects could be eased while still getting the positive anti-aging effects, <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said. Analysis of the six months of Retin-A use still is under way, he said. Divided into four groups, the 300-plus patients used daily doses of Retin-A ranging from the highest tretinoin concentration of 0.05 percent, to a moderate dose of 0.01 percent, to a weak dose of 0.001 percent, to a zero-dose placebo group. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> study used concentrations twice as high, at 0.10 strength. Nearly 90 percent of patients using the 0.05 dose showed at least some improvement, with half showing moderate to strong improvement, said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. Those using lower doses showed some effects of the Retin-A, but the results were much weaker and `` questionable,'' he said. The patients in the study were from 50 to 70 years old and were chosen because they showed moderate, not severe, signs of sun-damaged skin: mostly fine, but also some coarse wrinkling, also blotchy coloring and rough texture. All of these factors were visibly and statistically rated, as were the side effects. In addition, the length and depth of wrinkles were measured in plastic impressions, and skin biopsies are still being analyzed microscopically. Patients used the Retin-A daily, along with sunscreens and moisturizers. `` The biggest improvement was in the skin pigment, in evening out the skin's color and getting rid of blotches and brown spots,'' said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. `` The next biggest improvment was in fine wrinkling _ the cross-hatches below the eye and in the crow's - After that, we saw improvement in texture _ in smoothing out rough skin.'' There was also some improvement in deeper, coarser wrinkles in some patients, but since that problem was not prevalent in most of the patients, it was difficult to measure that impact scientifically, he said. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> also said the side effects of Retin-A were less than expected. `` Most people had mild to moderate side effects _ mostly peeling and some redness. By and large, the side effects were tolerated well. Usually, the effects would last a few days, then go away, then come back for a few days. After a few months, the skin seems to get used to the drug. Only three or four people had constant irritation, but nobody had any serious problems.'' So what is the best dosage of Retin-A to halt the ravages of time? `` I know this will sound like a cop-out,'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> answered. `` But that is something that has to be determined between the patient and the doctor. People react differently to the stuff. The doctor has to assess your skin type. He will know when the irritation is too much, and if you are using enough to get good results. That is why Retin-A will remain a prescription drug for some time.''

 Students voted Wednesday to end a university sit-in against government refusal to legalize their independent union, and said they would concentrate on electing the Solidarity parliament slate June 4. They said a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> court's rejection Tuesday of the application to register the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION>, was a futile attempt to divide students from Solidarity just the before the elections. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist authorities broke a pledge by not making <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> legal. The court ruling was pronounced the same day an episode of Solidarity's weekly television program was canceled `` The rejection of the registration of <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> breaks the round table decisions,'' he said in a statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It causes justified anxiety of <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> activists.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s independent union and <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> were recognized after their formation in 1980 but outlawed in 1982 under martial law. The `` round table'' accords the government and opposition signed April 5 provided for them to be made legal again, but a question arose about the <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> charter. The agreements also promised Solidarity access to television. At a news conference Wednesday, Solidarity spokesmen said their surveys indicate the union's candidates will do well. `` According to our preliminary studies concerning <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> our candidates have sufficient advantage to win the elections,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` The nervousness of the propaganda apparatus stems from this.'' He said the Solidarity candidate in central <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> had a 7-1 edge on <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, the former government spokesman running as an independent. A freely elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is being added to the unicameral parliament, called the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, and 35 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> seats are being contested. The other 65 percent are reserved for the Communists and their allies. <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, national Solidarity spokesman, counseled `` moderation and reason'' before the elections. `` The students' strong reaction is psychologically understandable,'' he said. `` We think students will find effective means of action that will assure legalization of <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> and also take into account the general political consequences of their actions.'' About 300 students took part in a noon rally at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and said they would end the sit-in Thursday. They began the protest Tuesday and were joined by students in other cities. Whether those sit-ins also would end was not clear. Warm applause greeted <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s statement when it was read at the campus rally. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where he is an electrician at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> and led the strike in which Solidarity was born. During a campaign rally at the shipyard, which the government has ordered closed, he and Solidarity candidates said the union was committed to saving it. One of the chants workers directed at the government was: `` <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> is yours, but the shipyard is ours!'' It is scheduled to close at the end of 1990. <PERSON> Slawek </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorecki </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the court decision was a government attempt to divide students from Solidarity, but they would continue to support the Solidarity election campaign. `` This provocation has failed and has even consolidated'' <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> and Solidarity, he said. `` Though there were differences between us, this ... will help clear them up.'' Many students believe Solidarity did not press hard enough for the legalization of their union. <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>, Solidarity leader for the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> region, told the students the court decision `` was done to divide us'' before the election, `` to cause trouble just when we have the chance for the biggest victory in postwar <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' The government press office said it had no immediate response to charges that the April agreements had been violated, and referred inquiries to state television authorities and the court. Spokesmen at both institutions said no one was available to comment. Just before the Solidarity program was scheduled to be broadcast Tuesday, an announcer read a statemtnt saying authorities had canceled it `` because the contents ... aim against the round-table agreements.'' The 45-minute broadcast was to have been the third weekly program produced by Solidarity. It consisted of a discussion of human rights by Solidarity candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> who are lawyers. <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, the national Solidarity spokesman, said the government apparently objected to references in the discussion to abuses by riot police and other security forces. He suggested Solidarity shows be submitted to regular censors, who have rules about what should be cut, rather than being canceled entirely if the authorities are displeased.

<TEXT>
 The INF treaty demonstrates that willingness. In addition, in the past decade, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has unilaterally removed 2,400 shorter-range theater warheads. But theater nuclear forces contribute to stability, no less than strategic forces. And thus it would be irresponsible to depend solely on strategic nuclear forces to defer conflict in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The conventional balance in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is just as important and is linked to the nuclear balance for more than 40 years. And look at your history books to see how pronounced this accomplishment is. For more than 40 years, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's massive advantage in conventional forces has cast a shadow over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The unilateral reductions President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has promised give us hope that we can now redress that imbalance. We welcome those steps because, if implemented, they will help reduce the threat of surprise attack. And they confirm what we've said all along _ that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> military power far exceeds the levels needed to defend the legitimate security interests of the U.S.S.R. And we must keep in mind that these reductions alone, even if implemented, are not enough to eliminate the significant numerical superiority that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> enjoys right now. Through negotiation, we can now transform the military landscape of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The issues are complex. Stakes are very high. But the Soviets are now being forthcoming and we hope to achieve the reductions that we seek. Let me emphasize _ our aim is nothing less than removing war as an option in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> has said that it is willing to abandon its age-old reliance on offensive strategy. It's time to begin. This should mean a smaller force, one less reliant on tanks and artillery and personnel carriers that provide the Soviets' offensive striking power A restructured <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, one that mirrors the defensive posture of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, would make <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the world more secure. Peace can also be enhanced by movement towards more openness in military activities. And two weeks ago, I proposed an open-skies initiative to extend the concept of openness. That plan for territorial overflights would increase our mutual security against sudden and threatening military activities. In the same spirit, let us extend this openness to military expenditures as well. I call on the Soviets to do as we have always done. Let's open the ledgers, publish an accurate defense budget. But as we move forward, we must be realistic. Transformations of this magnitude will not happen overnight. If we are to reach our goals, a great deal is required of us, our allies and of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but we can succeed. I began today by speaking about the triumph of a particular, peculiar, very special American ideal: freedom. And I know there are those who may think there is something presumptuous about that claim, those who will think it's boastful, but it is not for one simple reason. Democracy is n't our creation. It is our inheritance, and we ca n't take credit for democracy, but we can take that precious gift of freedom, preserve it and pass it on as my generation does to you and you, too, will do one day. And perhaps, provided we seize the opportunities open to us, we can help others attain the freedom that we cherish. As I said on the Capitol steps on the day I took this office, president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` There is but one just use of power, and it is to serve people.'' As your commander in chief, let me call on this Coast Guard class to reaffirm with me that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> power will continue in its service to the enduring ideals of democracy and freedom. Congratulations to each and every one of you, thank you and <PERSON> God </PERSON> bless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Thank you all very much.

 Lawmakers resumed their battle today over whether the government should spend an additional $ 822 million this year to combat drug traffickers and provide $ 1.2 billion for veterans programs. On a 219-201 vote, majority Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> overcame a procedural effort by Republicans to block consideration of the spending bill and the chamber began considering the spending proposal. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> debated the issues nearly a month after a $ 4.7 billion domestic spending bill that contained money for anti-drug and veterans program failed to clear the chamber s considered it too costly. Now, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will have another crack at the proposals, which have been altebecause lawmakerred slightly in form but have retained their propensity for attracting controversy.

 The top army command published a letter Wednesday strongly supporting conservative Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, who is locked in a bitter battle for power with rival factions opposing his crackdown on student protesters. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> told diplomats a meeting of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making Politburo would be called Thursday or Friday, perhaps signaling the behind-the-scenes power struggle between <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was coming to a head. <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s parliament, cut short a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and flew home Wednesday for what he said were `` health reasons.'' But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials thought he was hurrying back to demand <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s ouster. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political crisis was touched off by student protests for a freer society and cleaner government that began in mid-April. Tens of thousands of students remained in a tent city at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the symbolic center of power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, for a 12th day Wednesday to press the demands. Protest marches continued throughout the nation, with demonstrations reported Wednesday in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION> province. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> declared martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Saturday to restore order to the city where more than 1 million residents have demonstrated in support of the students. The crackdown, apparently made with the approval of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, triggered widespread calls for <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s ouster. Troops deployed on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> since Friday were prevented from moving on the square by throngs of people who surrounded the convoys and built street barricades. The crowds pleaded with the soldiers not to attack and they retreated into barracks, leading to speculation that <PERSON> Li </PERSON> could not control the military. However, the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> published a letter Wednesday in the military newspaper strongly supporting <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s hard-line position against the students. The letter was dated Monday, the same day more than 100 senior army officers called for an end to martial law, and it indicated an apparent split in the military. `` In this serious political struggle that affects the future fate of the nation ... the troops will face every kind of difficulty and test in their task of ending the disturbance and restoring normal order,'' the letter said. It urged the troops to study a tough speech <PERSON> Li </PERSON> made Friday and an April 26 People's Daily editorial criticizing the students, in order to `` fully understand the nature of this struggle and the mission of enforcing martial law.'' `` A extreme minority of people are fanning the flames, creating turmoil, with the goal of negating the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the socialist system,'' it said. `` In the face of this great struggle between truth and falsehood, we must maintain a clear mind.'' Widespread military support of the crackdown was reported by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It said six of seven army commands, the air force and navy approved. Only the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> command was not mentioned. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported 26 of 31 provinces announced support for the government's decision to maintain social order in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> by calling in troops. The 3.2 million-member <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is likely to be crucial in resolving the ongoing political standoff. The grassroots-style military played a key role in the revolution led by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> that created communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and it also was used in previous power struggles, most recently in the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. Contradictory rumors continued to swirl about the fate of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leaders. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was reported to receive backing from <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, a member of the five-person <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in charge of propaganda, and <PERSON> Ba </PERSON> <PERSON> Jin </PERSON>, the country's most famous living writer. Adding an ominous note was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s decision to cut off for a second time satellite transmissions by Western TV networks. Western broadcasters were told their ability to transmit from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ended as of midnight Wednesday -LRB- 11 a.m. EDT Wednesday -RRB-. An earlier ban on transmitting videotape was lifted the day before. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to stop jamming <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and refrain from violence against protesters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who met Tuesday with <PERSON> Wan </PERSON>, also expressed his commitment to strong U.S.-China relations, and the two discussed the recent Soviet-Sino summit, the White House said. Although Tiananmen remained the focus of the protest, many of the students from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> University who began the sit-in at the square May 13 have returned to school to do organizational work. A large proportion of the students now in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> have arrived from out of town to be at the center of the historic pro-democracy movement. `` I have come to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to take part in a great revolution,'' said <PERSON> Ji </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiujie </PERSON>, a 20-year-old university junior from <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province. The fifth day of martial law passed with life returning to normal in the capital. Fewer barricades were up to snarl traffic after most troops withdrew from street deployment Monday night. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> reported 172 of 174 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> bus routes were in operation by Wednesday morning. Subway service also resumed. Main shopping streets were crowded and markets were well-stocked with food and daily items.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee today took a `` fresh look'' at charges against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, but the panel's chairman said he did n't know whether any minds were changed by arguments advanced a day earlier by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyer. The committee held a morning session lasting two hours and agreed to meet again later in the day, although there was no word on when a vote would be taken on whether to proceed with the two main allegations against the embattled speaker. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> insisted he was n't thinking of relinquishing his office, even temporarily, no matter what the committee decided. But the speaker met with his lawyer-adviser, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, and ethics committee attorneys met with another member of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s legal team, fueling speculation that a deal was being discussed that could involve a change at the very top of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> personally proclaimed his innocence Tuesday night. At the same time, he spoke about the possibility of losing his job, telling reporters that if he became politically crippled he `` would n't want to be speaker.'' Some of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s fellow Democrats have said that the speaker should give up his leadership post if he unable to clear his name swiftly on charges he engaged in financial dealings that violated House rules. Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., the ethics committee chairman, told reporters this morning as the closed-door meeting began that members would take `` a fresh look'' at the charges it brought against the speaker, in the wake of arguments presented at the hearing Tuesday `` I do n't know if any minds were changed yesterday,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. He also declined to predict when the committee might rule on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s motion to dismiss charges against him. The two most serious groups of allegations contend that the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat used bulk sales of his book repeatedly to evade rules limiting outside income and that he improperly took gifts from a developer friend who had a direct interest in legislation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has discussed the possibility of resigning before he raised the issue Tuesday night, but his latest comments came with his situation at an especially critical point. Pressure is mounting on his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, who are torn between loyalty to the speaker and concern that his political troubles may be unresolvable. `` The political pressure is so intense that until this matter is resolved the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> is paralyzed,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. The ethics panel, in its rare televised session Tuesday, heard arguments from lawyers representing the speaker and from the team of investigators whose report led to 69 allegations that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated House rules. The speaker's lawyer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, argued that the committee was stretching <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in charging the speaker. Special outside counsel <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> countered that ethics should not be judged on narrow legalisms. <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> said today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' he believes <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> can prevail `` if he gets his day in court, if he can get on the witness stand and put Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on the witness stand to testify what she did to earn her keep. `` Whether he's politically a dead man or not I do n't know,'' <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> said, but added that he sensed a `` feeling in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public that ` wait a second. we're going a little too fast here. Maybe we should n't be putting <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on this railroad.''' Normally, dismissal motions such as <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s are a routine part of a case. However, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats have grown increasingly uncomfortable with the speaker's situation and some have suggested that he must turn things around now or he should step down. `` He needs a victory. That's clear. Only by succeeding on one of the charges can <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and the public take another look at the entire case,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, a member of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s defense team. Lawmakers will be reading the committee's decision like tea leaves to determine the speaker's future. <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> said he might consider a 6-6 tie within the committee on one of the charges as a victory. That would not dismiss a charge, but it could mean there is no majority within the committee for moving it to the next step in its process _ a trial-like disciplinary hearing where <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> himself might testify. If the committee held that hearing, it would then make a report to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, possibly recommending punishment. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, a possible gubernatorial candidate who has come under attack from Republicans who portray him as a <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> ally, issued a statement Tuesday seeking to distance himself from the troubled speaker. `` If the speaker is not exonerated by the ethics panel and if the ethics committee concludes that Speaker <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, then I think he should resign.'' During Tuesday's hearing, members of the committee discussed the political angst that's come from their work. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pashayan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a Republican member, said he was `` disheartened'' that some lawmakers were prejudging the case. `` It is the duty of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ... to come before this committee and present himself,'' he said, promising to take a `` fresh look'' before rendering a verdict. The speaker did not attend the arguments but his wife <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> did. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spoke to reporters briefly as he left the Capitol, and said he was optimistic. `` I think we clearly had the better side of the legal argument,'' he said, accusing <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> of `` distorting facts.'' Asked whether he believed he could survive as speaker, he said, `` That remains to be seen. ... If I ca n't be not just a respectable speaker, but an effective speaker, then I would n't want to be speaker. `` I want to be an effective person in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and I've had that privilege. Most of all I want to protect my good name and that of my wife and my colleagues,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s contention that one of the gifts to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was a no-work job for his wife <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON> closed out the speaker's arguments before the committee Tuesday, saying the ethics panel has succeeded even if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is not found guilty. `` If our work is to convince the American people of its integrity and its honesty, we will not serve that purpose by taking the life of one man, his career, his place in history, and throwing it overboard as just so much excess baggage,'' he said. `` You've done your duty You've made the powerful accountable.''

<HEAD>911 Foul-Up Was Human Error, Police Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A dispatcher jotted down the wrong telephone number when a terrified woman called 911 to report a break-in, prompting police to send a patrol car to the wrong town while the woman was being raped, authorities said. Police also revealed Tuesday that the woman spent several chilling minutes on the phone with emergency dispatchers while the rapist listened and brandished a knife. The woman had called to report a prowler early Sunday morning, but the intruder burst into her home in mid-call. She then pretended to be talking to her mother while trying to convey information to the dispatcher. When the dispatcher asked for a phone number, the victim `` rattled it off, saying something like, ` Oh, you know my number, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON>, it's ...,''' <LOCATION> Midvale </LOCATION> police Capt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said. However, the dispatcher copied down the number incorrectly. And when she read it back to the victim for confirmation, the victim affirmed it was correct. Moments later, the victim hung up. The incorrect phone number corresponded to an address in <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION>, about two miles northwest of <LOCATION> Midvale </LOCATION>, and two police officers were dispatched. When they found nothing amiss at the Sandy address, they reported the call to be unfounded and no further action was taken. An hour and a half later, the rapist left the victim and she phoned again for police assistance. Police found her home the second time. The victim was able to get a vehicle license number and a 33-year-old man was arrested Sunday and booked into the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> of <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> was charged Tuesday with aggravated rape, aggravated burglary and aggravated kidnapping. Bail was set at $ 50,000. The incident occurred during the transition to an enhanced 911 system in the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Midvale </LOCATION> are <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> suburbs. Under the new system, <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said, the possibility of similar mistakes occurring will be virtually eliminated because a caller's telephone number and address will automatically appear on a dispatcher's computer screen Under the old system, calls have been lost and numbers garbeled `` time and time again,'' <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said. `` That's why we pushed for the new system.''

<HEAD>Auditors Criticize Energy Department Plan For New Military Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` improper and unrealistic'' estimates of the cost of building new military reactors in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, federal auditors told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Wednesday. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> also said the department had understated the time it would take to complete the reactors, which the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says can be in operation within 10 years for $ 6.8 billion. In testimony before a special panel of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant comptroller general, raised doubts about other key aspects of the administration's plan, which was announced last August. The administration is seeking $ 300 million in next year's budget for design work. The reactors would produce tritium, a radioactive gas used to make nuclear warheads. One reactor is to be built at the department's <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Site </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and the other would be new at the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. The department wants them in production by 1998 as replacements for three 35-year-old <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors which have been shut down for repairs. Peach said recent breakdowns at the existing <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors, which are the nation's only source of tritium, make the need for new reactors `` more acute,'' but he raised doubts about the new technology to be used at the new plants. `` There is some high risk associated with getting the technology to work,'' he said. Peach also questioned the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s cost calculations for the 18 different options it considered. He said the department had taken cost estimates for full-sized reactors and `` scaled them down'' for use in figuring the cost of smaller reactors. `` In our judgment, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s scaling assumptions were not realistic and resulted in improper and unrealistic cost estimates for the various options,'' <PERSON> Peach </PERSON> said. Peach's public remarks were less harsh than the language used in private reports to the panel's members and its staff, according to sources who asked not to be identified. These sources said panel members were told in private briefings by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> officials who are working on the agency's review of the new reactor program that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had `` misinformed'' the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and was guilty of `` manipulation'' of figures used in calculating the construction cost and timetable. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> review is not yet complete, and no official report has been published. When asked about the accusations made by other <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Peach </PERSON> did not disavow the charges but said his main concern was that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had not yet provided <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with enough information to make a decision on the plan's merits. A department official acknowledged to the panel that it could take 1 -LCB- years longer than the 10-year estimate offered to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for getting the new reactors running. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> says it would take at least 12 -LCB- years to get a heavy-water reactor into production at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and 16 years to begin tritium output at a modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor proposed for the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> site. It disputed the department's $ 6.8 billion cost estimate for the two reactors but gave no estimate of its own The agency said a shorter and less costly alternative would be to convert the partially completed WNP1 commercial nuclear plant at the Hanford Reservation, near <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, to tritium production. This could be done in seven years for $ 2.2 billion. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, acting director of the department's new reactor program, said he could give no firm cost estimates for the proposed reactors until design work is finished next year. <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> also said Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was leaving open the possibility of converting the WNP1 reactor to tritium production but is concerned about public and congressional opposition.

 Buses and subways were running Wednesday and a line formed once again outside <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, a sign that pro-democracy protests have not brought everyday life to a halt in the capital. But residents said the upheaval had changed their level of awareness and interest in current events. As one 33-year-old shopper put it, daily life in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> continues much as it did before martial law was imposed Friday, but `` the people are n't the same.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, attended by most children from the English-speaking foreign community in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, announced it would resume classes Thursday. School was called off a week ago because roadblocks set up by citizens trying to keep troops out of the city created traffic problems hazardous to children. On Wednesday, most blockades were down and traffic appeared near normal. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported 172 of 174 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> bus routes were in operation. The subway also returned to normal service. The blockades _ made of buses, road dividers, garbage cans and trucks _ brought public transportation to a virtual halt for three days. Many people relied on bicycles to get around, but others found it impossible to go to work. The fashionable shopping street Wangfujing, just a few blocks east of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> _ the center of the protests _ was crowded with buses, street cars and shoppers. Department store shelves were full and stands were brimming with lunch boxes, roasted <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> duck, popsicles and other popular food. `` The supplies of rice, oil, sugar and other things has been normal,'' said a 65-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor visiting Wangfujing. Earlier in the week, officials had warned of imminent shortages of basic supplies if the roadblocks remained. Music blared from stores selling cassette tapes, while customers shelled out $ 46 for medicinal deer tail at the Yong Ren Tang Drugstore. At the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> restaurant on the southwest corner of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, about 30 people were lined up at the counter at 11:30 a.m.. An assistant manager said business was returning to normal after sales dropped by about half during the height of the demonstrations A market about 2 -LCB- miles east of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> boasted hills of cabbage and other vegetables, and a 31-year-old clerk insisted prices had not gone up as a result of the upheaval. `` Before, I would just read the evening newspaper,'' said the store clerk. `` But now I read the People's Daily, the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily and other papers'' for the latest developments. A retired worker said his interest has expanded beyond economic news. `` Now I read the news about politics, the student movement and the situation in other provinces,'' he said.

<HEAD>GAO and Pepper Reports Blast Private Long-Term Care for Elderly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Private nursing home insurance is so poorly regulated by states that federal rules may be necessary to protect <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s elderly from ripoffs, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. In a report prepared at the direction of 88-year-old Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said many states allow insurers to sell policies with less protection than recommended by model plans developed by the national organization of state insurance commissioners. `` While such provisions can result in lower policy premiums,'' the report said, `` they can adversely affect policy holders by decreasing the likelihood that needed services will be covered and increasing the risk of policy terminations for reasons other than non-payment of premiums.'' Pepper, chairman of the health and long-term care subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging, is hospitalized in serious condition at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which he entered more than six weeks ago for treatment of an undisclosed stomach illness. The 88-year-old <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrat issued through aides his own report in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report. `` The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report underscores my subcommittee's findings that long-term care insurance is simply not a good buy and adequate consumer protections are not in place at the state or federal level,'' said Pepper's statement. `` As currently designed, nursing home policies offer seniors a false sense of security.'' Pepper said private long-term care insurance can help fill gaps in a yet-to-be developed Medicare-like federal nursing home program, but should be banned from sale as primary coverage for long-term care. `` In the absence of such a ban, only those private long-term care insurance policies certified as meeting federal minimum standards should be allowed to be sold,'' his statement said. Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> health subcommittee, has introduced a bill to establish such minimum federal standards The measure, patterned on model legislation recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> also would provide criminal sanctions against fraudulent sales practices. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said only one-half of states have adopted legislation to regulate long-term care insurance, and even those `` vary in the degree to which they meet <ORGANIZATION> NAIC </ORGANIZATION>'s recommended minimum standards.'' `` To help assure that new policies provide at least a minimum level of consumer protection, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may want to consider the desirability of enacting federal legislation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. An estimated 1 million long-term policies are in effect now compared to about 125,000 only two years ago. Long-term care expenditures, mostly for nursing home stays, are expected to exceed $ 46 billion this year, with individuals paying about half the total. Average yearly nursing home costs exceed $ 25,000.

 Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> signed legislation today restricting the sale and possession of assault weapons in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a first-in-the-nation law stemming from a schoolyard massacre. The two bills signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor virtually ban the sale of more than 50 specified semiautomatic assault rifles, pistols and shotguns after Jan. 1 and sharply restrict their possession. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said at the signing ceremony that law enforcement officers `` need all the help we can give.'' One gun-owners group immediately attacked the governor's action, vowing to mount a recall drive against him and <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Roos </PERSON>, author of one of the bills. `` Hundreds and thousands of gun owners throughout this state have called or written to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. Their message has been ignored,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kempton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Victorville </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Attempts to restrict such weapons had been blocked repeatedly by the gun lobby, led by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, until a shooting rampage at a <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> school four months ago left five children and the gunman dead. The slayings by a deranged drifter carrying a semiautomatic AK-47 rifle rallied the public support needed to push the measure through. Under the legislation, people who owned the listed weapons before June 1 may keep them by obtaining permits. Otherwise, the guns can be possessed only with a special-needs permit, such as those obtained by movie studios for machine guns. Possession would be a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine, or a felony, carrying up to three years in prison. The bills would also increase the penalties for crimes in which assault weapons are used. The bills would allow the attorney general to go into court to add similar guns to the list.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The West German president called Wednesday for unity within the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance and warned politicians against letting the pursuit of votes sway policy. In an address marking the nation's 40th anniversary, President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> criticized a `` majority mandate'' style of leadership in a reference apparently aimed at Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is at the center of a dispute with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> over the fate of short-range nuclear weapons based on West German soil. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> has insisted on immediate superpower talks to remove the short-range missiles in defiance of the alliance's plan to upgrade the rockets. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s position was seen to follow a general drift to the left among West Germans, who believe recent improvements in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations warrant some relaxation of military policies. It was seen as an attempt to reverse a major slide in popularity for <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> `` It is not high-handedness that is the greater danger, but rather an attempt, in pursuit of votes, to simultaneously fulfill too many wishes,'' <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> told politicians, diplomats and celebrities attending the festivities. He called for unity within the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The alliance begins a meeting Monday and the short-range missile crisis will be high on the agenda. `` Under the conditions of the Cold War it was easy to be united,'' <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> said of the alliance. `` It becomes more uncomfortable when the world no longer gives clear information on who is for us and who is against us.'' <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> praised Soviet reforms and called for new thinking in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as well. He warned, however, that despite the warming trend in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations, it would be unthinkable to stray from the alliance. `` We in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are irrevocably embedded in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> said. `` A superpower we are not, but neither are we the plaything of another.'' Parliament President <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Suessmuth </PERSON>, who also addressed the gathering in the flower-decked <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, said the continuing division of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> marred the celebrations. `` In spite of the gratitude we feel today, we can not be satisfied with the situation of a nation divided by walls and barbed wire,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Suessmuth </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, the 69-year-old <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> was re-elected to a second five-year term. In his acceptance speech, he praised West German economic prowess but said much work lies ahead. `` We have no ground for self-satisfaction,'' <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> said. `` We have not become angels under the Basic Law.'' The Basic Law, adopted May 23, 1949, is the constitutional foundation of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and has won praise for guiding the defeated nation from ruin to international respect. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the world's largest exporter and enjoys one of the highest standards of living. But <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> suggested the nation's way of life is threatened by resistance to social change.

A <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said it would take several days to determine the casuse of the blaze. No other injuries were reported.

 American pharmaceutical laboratories are chalking up strong gains in use of biotechnology to develop new drugs and appear to be maintaining their lead over the Japanese, industry and government officials said Wednesday. Major targets of the effort aided by sophisticated genetic engineering techniques include cancer and AIDS. `` Five years ago there were predictions that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would overtake us in biotechnology by the end of the decade,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` That has not happened. There is enormous vitality in today's biotechnology research and development in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he added. <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON> said 70 genetically engineered drugs and vaccines are currently in human clinical tests in this country, while 10 others on which clinical testing has been completed are at the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for review before they can be marketed. He also said that of 182 biotechnology health care patents issued in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year, 155 had American owners _ far ahead of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with 15 patents and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with nine. <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON> was joined at a news conference by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a special assistant to <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said a survey recently conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> of Japanese pharmaceutical research and development `` reveals that despite a high level of activity in Japanese industry, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> does, indeed, appear to be ahead of its Japanese counterparts in new biotechnology pharmaceuticals.'' `` Japanese production of new drugs with biotechnology techniques is robust, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holds roughly a two to one lead in both numbers of companies involved and numbers of products,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> official said. Genetic engineering involves manipulating the genes that determine the fundamental physical characteristics of an organism. A survey released by the industry association found that cancer is still the main focus of pharmaceutical biotechnology research. More than half _ 45 _ of the products involved in clinical tests or undergoing <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> review are targeted at cancer or cancer-related conditions. It also reported that 14 genetically engineered products _ almost twice as many as were listed in the association's first such survey last July _ are being tested for AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses. <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON> said the association was concerned about efforts by states to get involved in `` duplicative and unnecessary regulation'' of biotechnology, despite the existence of `` a comprehensive regulatory scheme at the federal level.'' He said that in 1988, 10 state legislative measures were introduced and three passed _ in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Currently, <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON> said, a biotechnology-related bill is awaiting the governor's action in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> while additional measures are pending before legislators in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Wednesday barred the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> from enforcing a juvenile-curfew law aimed at curbing drug-related violence in the nation's capital. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said the law which would keep people below age 18 off the streets from 11 p.m to 6 a.m. violates the constitutional rights of thousands of the city's juveniles. The curfew would begin at midnight on Friday and Saturday. The Temporary Curfew Emergency Act of 1989 `` subjects the district's juveniles to virtual house arrest each night'' and `` is a bull in a china shop of constitutional values,'' said <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>. `` However laudable the objectives which motivated its adoption, the act is invalid on its face and may not be enforced,'' he said in a 35-page opinion. He said the law would `` unconstitutionally burden'' the First Amendment and Fifth Amendment due process rights of `` thousands of innocent juveniles.'' `` We can not throw the baby out with the bathwater in our efforts to deal with the problems that beset us,'' he added. The curfew statute was signed April 14 by Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. It contains exemptions from the curfew for teen-agers returning home from work and those traveling with parents. There also would be exceptions for youths returning home from school and church-sanctioned functions. `` The act, even with its exemptions, prohibits every innocent juvenile in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> from moving about the city as he or she pleases at night,'' said the judge. `` Every juvenile in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> would be arrested if he or she sought to wander the monuments at night, or if he or she sought to gaze at the stars from a public park.'' The local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> obtained a temporary restraining order April 20 against the law and the district government agreed to an extension until the court reached a final decision. The law `` was more of a response to political pressure than it was a realistic approach to the problems,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>, legal director of the local <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> chapter, said after the court decision. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> was representing a group of minors who would have been affected by the curfew, several parents of minors and individuals affiliated with religious organizations. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was n't immediately available for comment on the ruling. The curfew would have been in effect for 90 days, and the mayor, if satisfied with it, could have asked the city council that it be continued.

 With songs like `` Smoke Is No Joke,'' and a skit that turned the big bad wolf into a wheezing wimp, the first group of first-graders graduated with honors Wednesday from a national anti-smoking program. Seven-year-old <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON>, wearing a mortar board made of red construction paper and a proud grin, promised she would never be a smoker. `` If I smoke, I'll get sick,'' she said, noting that her father smokes and she is trying to get him to stop. The `` Smoke-Free Class of 2000'' program started last fall in 28,000 schools with the aim of ensuring the 800,000 first-graders are non-smokers through their high school graduations. It is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The goal is to reach children before cigarette advertising does. Most smokers first try cigarettes between the ages of 12 and 14, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>. By the sixth grade, 7 percent of boys and girls call themselves regular smokers, said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Nearly 20 percent of American teen-agers smoke cigarettes, according to <ORGANIZATION> NIDA </ORGANIZATION>. About half of the high school seniors who smoke say they want to quit, but follow-up studies show 73 percent are still daily smokers eight years later. `` As the age where kids begin to smoke gets lower and lower, we want to begin the education process earlier,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON>, spokewoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, the 70 first-graders at the <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> school seemed to have heard the non-moking message. They staged a skit about a dozen little pigs and a wolf who's a heavy smoker. The wolf threatens to huff and puff and blow their house down, but coughs and wheezes instead. `` Who's afraid of the wolf that smokes? Not me!'' the children sang. Before an audience of parents, teachers and kindergartners, who will participate in the program next fall, the children also performed a song called `` Smoke Is No Joke.'' Among the lyrics: `` Smoking is dumb, real cool cats do n't try it; Smoking wo n't do a thing for you, real cool cats pass by it.'' Each child was given a handshake and an honorary degree from state Rep. <PERSON> Lucile </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, who sponsored a successful bill that banned smoking on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> school was chosen for the model program because it is ethnically mixed and has one of the largest first-grade classes in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, but the smoking issue has a special significance in its <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` In surveys that have been done, there was a significantly higher rate of heavy smoking, and smoking in general, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The teaching materials, which are being distributed free to participating schools, tell first-graders that smoke is air pollution. They also teach that other people's smoke makes eyes water, and hair and clothing smell bad. The anti-smoking program is a five-day program of 20-minute lessons designed to be part of an overall health curriculum. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to produce the educational materials for next year, as the inaugural program and the kids move on to second grade, <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON> said. `` We hope through publicity that all schools will adopt it,'' <PERSON> Gelman </PERSON> said of the program, which reached about half of the first-grade classrooms in the country during its first year.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Wednesday <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s renewed restriction of news broadcasts transmitted by satellite `` is regrettable,'' and called for an end to the jamming of the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and open access for journalists <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities informed Western networks they would not be able to transmit by satellite after 1 a.m., or noon <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> time on Wednesday. `` It is regrettable,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said of the satellite restriction. The move ends the networks' ability to broadcast pictures directly from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Satellite transmissions had been banned after martial law went into effect on Saturday. The news organizations were prevented from using their own satellite installations to transmit their reports. But foreign broadcasters were allowed to transmit news reports for a brief time on Tuesday on the satellite operated by the Chinese television network, <ORGANIZATION> CCTV </ORGANIZATION>. `` The unimpeded reception of radio broadcasts and unrestricted satellite transmissions are, in our view, among the elements of a free press, and we hope they will be supported and sustained in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. The spokeswoman reminded reporters that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had urged non-violence and restraint during his White House meeting on Tuesday with <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. She said the president `` urges that not only the satellite feeds but the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> not be jammed and that reporters be given open access.'' Many of the demonstrators have relied on foreign news radio broadcasts for updates on events in their own country throughout the five weeks of protests. The spokeswoman added that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s warning that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens delay travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is still in effect. The department has also advised Americans in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to avoid the demonstrations. She termed the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` tense ... but calm.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has been in touch in with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` to keep them appraised of the situation of what's going on,'' but Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said she was unaware that anyone had been advised to transfer personnel out of the country because of the unrest.

Flight 191 was over in seconds, the jetliner and its inhabitants instantly reduced to scattered debris in what remains the nation's worst air crash The plane lost an engine on takeoff, banked sideways out of control and slammed into a nearby field, exploding into a jet-fuel inferno. All 258 passengers and 13 crew members died, as well as two people on the ground. `` Just the sound of a jet _ it just brings it back every time I hear a plane go by,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Devito </PERSON> of <PERSON> Mokena </PERSON>, who had driven his girlfriend, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Moruzi </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Moruzi </PERSON> and a girlfriend were booked onto Flight 191 to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the first leg of an eagerly awaited trip to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. After they boarded, <PERSON> Devito </PERSON> went to an observation deck to watch the takeoff. As the plane moved down the runway, <PERSON> Devito </PERSON> noticed white smoke coming from one engine. Once the plane was airborne, he saw flame and black smoke along a wing. Then the plane was down in a column of black smoke, and <PERSON> Devito </PERSON> was scrambling over fences and across runways to the site. Nothing resembling a plane was left. `` To this day, it's something that's hard to comprehend, how a big plane like that could disintegrate into little pieces,'' said <PERSON> Devito </PERSON>, 34, a real estate salesman. `` I ... did n't see a sign of a person, a piece of luggage, a magazine. `` Nobody had to tell me there were no survivors.'' The field is green now, but <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Police Sgt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, who was at a training facility nearby, can still find the furrow plowed by the DC-10's left wing in the flight's chaotic final seconds. `` I would never forget,'' said <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>. After the crash, he and other officers `` went through the smoke and came out the other side and there was no plane,'' he said. More than 200 lawsuits were filed after the crash. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the plane's builder, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, have paid damages estimated at more than $ 70 million. The National Transportation Safety Board laid primary blame for the crash on American, citing `` maintenance-induced damage'' _ a 10-inch crack in the engine mount _ that caused the left engine to tear loose. At issue was American's practice of removing the engine and the pylon that attached it to the plane as a unit, rather than in two pieces. The board said the accident `` resulted directly from improper and abusive maintenance practices.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> also criticized <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>' design as vulnerable to maintenance damage. And it said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had been remiss by not learning that a similar crack had recently been repaired in a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10. `` One thing we did do is get very specific about what has to be reported to us and what does n't,'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said Wednesday from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said no changes have been made in the DC-10 pylon design, except for a shift to flathead rather than raised-head bolts. Officials for Dallas-based American declined to comment. `` It's a sensitive issue,'' spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> He added that the airline would prefer to `` let the public record speak for itself.''

 Police say the description they have of a robbery suspect is the most thorough they've ever had, because the victim had just measured the man for a suit before he was robbed. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 31, owner of a tailoring and design shop, was bound and gagged with duct tape and slightly injured in Tuesday's robbery He told police his assailant was 5-foot-9 or 5-foot-10, about 165 or 170 pounds, 14 -LCB- - inch neck, 18-to-19-inch shoulders, 39-inch chest, waist 34 to 35, sleeves 25 -LCB- inches from the shoulder, and 41-inch hips The description of a companion was not so thorough, just around 6-foot-4 and at least 275 pounds. After being measured for the suit, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, the smaller man pushed him into a back room and, with the help of his friend, bound and gagged him after a struggle. The two then ransacked the rear of the shop, taking off with a camera, a watch and $ 24 from the cash register, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told police. He was freed after he managed to get the attention of the storekeeper next door. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he was given 13 stitches for a cut lip and suffered a possible broken nose and several bruises. `` What killed me was that they were so nice'' while discussing the suit, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Reformers Hope to be Allowed Independence in New Parliament</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gestures from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> have given hope to delegates of the new Soviet parliament that they will have an independent voice in solving pressing economic and social problems when its first session convenes Thursday. Early indications had been that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders intended to direct the decisions of the parliament, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, but they have been backing off lately. The leadership called a meeting Tuesday of its majority in the congress, rousing fear that the program would be dictated. Instead, the session was thrown open to non-party deputies and a free discussion followed, said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>, a member from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>, a construction engineer, described the meeting as a rehearsal for similar outspoken sessions in the congress. `` There are no decisions required of all the deputies,'' he said. `` This is very important.'' Kremlin leaders also dropped earlier proposals for a party slate to fill the 542 seats in a smaller working legislature to be elected by the congress, said <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristin </PERSON>, a deputy from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, the party ideologist, said on state television Tuesday night: `` I do n't think we should limit any discussions. We just have to live through them.'' On Monday, a meeting of deputies from the Russian republic rejected a partial slate of 147 names for the legislature submitted by party leaders, said <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Since no slate was offered at the Tuesday meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> deputies from all 15 republics, the leadership appears to have taken notice. As the opening session approached, reformers among the 2,250 members were busy looking for each other. Meetings were scheduled all over <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Volunteers made copies of the latest proposals and posted them. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the only legal political group for 70 years, is far better organized and enjoys such advantages as copying machines in a country that banned them for decades because of underground publishing. Although party members are an overwhelming majority in the new congress, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s cautiously reformist leadership can not count on support from either the conservative wing or those who want greater change. Ms. <PERSON> Lauristin </PERSON> said `` we were surprised that so many deputies from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> were so free in expressing their opinions'' at the party meeting Tuesday. She is a middle-aged professor considered an extremist by many Russians because she favors independence for <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. Hundreds of deputies have arrived with with specific proposals that range from a committee to oversee the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police to sovereignty for <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and the other two Baltic republics, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. Many Soviet citizens frustrated by empty stores and unkept promises to fill them have put their faith in the congress. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, quoted one on Wednesday as saying he hoped it would `` make our life, our country, such that you can once again say without blushing, ` I am a citizen of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.''' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Vitautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramanauskas </PERSON>, a Lithuanian deputy, as saying: `` A fierce struggle against the bureaucratic system is still ahead. If we do not crush it now, I see no way out of the predicament tomorrow.'' Technically, the congress has limited duties: electing the president, presumably <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>; approving a few top government appointments, and electing a smaller, full-time Supreme Soviet from its own members. It includes many reformers, however, who want the congress itself to address major problems. Among them are human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the maverick former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief who got into trouble by pushing for faster change. A poll reported in Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said 89 percent of 1,100 city dwellers from around the country believed the congress should discuss the economic, social and political situation. Under the official schedule, the congress has just two morning sessions before the Supreme Soviet it elects convenes on Saturday. The party has planned election of the president and Supreme Soviet as the first order of business, followed by discussions. Reformers want discussions first, then the elections. `` We have to pick the Supreme Soviet deputies after we have seen in the discussions who is who,'' or the new system will be no better than the old rubber-stamp legislature, <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said. He said a compromise agenda was being debated that would put <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s election and speech at the beginning, followed by discussions and election of the Supreme Soviet.

<HEAD>Fire In Shoshone Forest Has Officials Concerned About Fire Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CODY, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A unusual spring fire in a national forest next to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, still recovering from last year's huge fires, has forest officials nervous about this year's fire outlook The fire in the southern end of the <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> only covered about a quarter-acre, forest fire officer <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanogle </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` But normally you do n't get something like that happening this early,'' he said. The fire near <LOCATION> Dubois </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, so concerned Shoshone officials that beginning next month rangers will monitor fuel conditions in the southern end of the forest, he said. `` It could be a real problem area,'' <PERSON> Spanogle </PERSON> said. `` Once you get fire in it, it could be hard to stop. ... We have a potential of having some large fires down there.'' Last summer, forest fires started in northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> in late June and continued through the fall, charring more than 1 million acres in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, Grand Teton National Park, and the Shoshone and Bridger-Teton national forests. The conflagrations prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last July to abandon the `` let burn'' policy, which calls for most naturally caused fires in the park to burn untended as long as they do n't threaten structures or people Federal officials still are reviewing that policy and through this fire season all blazes _ natural and man-caused _ in national forests and parks will be attacked from the outset. Despite the relatively low fire danger conditions now being reported in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> forests, the long Memorial Day holiday weekend kicks off the summer tourist season and rangers will be urging campers to be careful with fires, said <PERSON> Spanogle </PERSON>. `` As it stands right now, we will have no -LRB- fire -RRB- restrictions on the <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, but I will sure urge that any campers who have live fires -LRB- to -RRB- be very careful,'' he said. In the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Every </PERSON> said fire danger currently is low. `` Contrary to last summer, we're in pretty good shape ... We got a pretty good snowpack this past winter,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, officials say heavy winter snow and a moist spring should produce a `` very, very lush'' early summer.

 The apartment building that 550 pounds of dynamite could n't destroy offered stiff resistance Wednesday to a wrecking ball. Three families evacuated from their nearby homes before the failed demolition attempts prepared to spend at least one more night in a motel. A larger wrecking crane was brought in after the 10-story <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> housing project building's walls buckled, but did not break, when a 2-ton wrecking ball slammed against them. The tower was battered but largely intact after two attempts failed to bring it down Sunday. `` It's a hard building,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Santanelli </PERSON>, a wrecking crane operator. `` It's coming apart good, but I ca n't see what I'm doing. <PERSON> Santanelli </PERSON> said the job will take three weeks but the building should be low enough that the three evacuated families can return Thursday. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, said the authority paid more than $ 400 to put the families up for two nights at a downtown hotel before moving them to a less luxurious motel in <LOCATION> Johnston </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> said he told the owners of a delicatessen and a coin laundry that have been closed by the demolition to file a claim for lost business with the insurance company that covered <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, the explosives expert who failed to raze the building.

<HEAD>New Gorbachev Arms Proposals Mounts Pressure On Bush Before NATO

<TEXT>
 New arms control proposals by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> put pressure Wednesday on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 15 allied leaders to come to terms with a series of eye-catching Soviet moves to reduce nuclear and conventional arsenals. With a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting due to open Monday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader virtually accepted Western demands that ceilings be set on troop levels in each East European country as well as on Soviet forces overall. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader had agreed to negotiated ceilings on Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and to an overall limitation on the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. That is, the officials said, Soviet forces could not exceed 35 percent to 40 percent of the combined strength of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. The two military alliances are in negotiations in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> over reductions in tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear armories across the expanse of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The new Soviet proposals were outlined on Tuesday in a closed meeting in the Austrian capital, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Soviet negotiators also reiterated <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals for drastic cutbacks in troops and in several weapons categories. The Soviet president and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had given the figures to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> two weeks ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a speech Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said, `` The Soviets are now being forthcoming and we hope to achieve the reductions that we seek.'' Referring to the specifics in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal, though, he said: `` These reductions alone, even if implemented, are not enough to eliminate the superiority the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> enjoys now.'' Still, the moves by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in response to long-standing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands were welcome news _ even though they add to the task confronting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the other Western leaders in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. The alliance already is divided over whether to negotiate reductions in short-range nuclear missiles. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> leads the countries pushing for U.S.-Soviet talks, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> are the strongest foes of negotiations over the issue. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> argue that nuclear missiles are necessary _ and must be made more menacing _ in order to deter Soviet attack from a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact that holds an edge in manpower and in some weapons categories. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s latest moves, however, reinforce the opposing argument that Soviet reductions are eroding any need for ground-based <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> nuclear missiles as a deterrent. Presure has been building on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced late last year the Soviets would withdraw 5,000 tanks and 50,000 troops from Central and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and cut Soviet forces by 500,000 overall. In January, he said defense spending would be slashed 14.2 percent, although Soviet officials said later it was difficult to calculate how much was being spent on armed forces. And two weeks ago he told <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> he would unilaterally withdraw 500 Soviet nuclear warheads from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his speech Wednesday, urged the Soviets to `` open the ledgers'' and provide accurate military spending figures. He also renewed his proposal for aerial inspections of troop concentrations. Last month, <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>, a leading Russian rocket scientist and prominent reformer, said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would publish defense figures and space budgets by the end of the year. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> sought to play down the importance of the latest <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal, saying it was a response to a plan proposed last March 9 by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` The Soviets have provided details in a meaningful way at the negotiating table. It is a serious proposal and we look forward to the negotiations.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s response was a holding action until the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting. Soviet proposals for cuts in non-nuclear forces require a response from the alliance itself, not the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signaled a shift in tone. `` The president felt he appeared too negative before, and he's trying to appear more positive now,'' said his national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>

<HEAD>Progress In Male Contraceptive Being Made, Doctor Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Encouraging progress is being made on developing a reversible birth-control method for men, the first non-permanent male contraceptive since the condom was invented about 200 years ago, a researcher says. Twenty-two Seattle-area men and their sexual partners are among about 250 couples worldwide participating in a study in which the men are injected with an anabolic steroid that shuts off sperm production, Dr. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday. The purpose of the injectable contraceptive is to provide a reversible, alternative method to vasectomy, and also to take some of the burden of birth control off women, said <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> professor of medicine and a major researcher in male contraception. The product, if successful, may be marketable in about 10 years, he said. `` This is a drug-seeking, dose-seeking exercise,'' <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> said of the human test program. The injections are a combination of the male hormone testosterone and a compound that helps the hormone stay active in the body for seven to 10 days. When enough of the drug is injected, the brain senses it, signaling the testes to stop sperm production. The injections of the synthetic hormone testosterone enanthate or TE are well below the steroid dosages that some athletes use, <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> senior scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Worcester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Experimental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that the male injectable contraceptive seems to be effective because research so far indicates that TE does maintain male sexual drive. The foundation is where the original female birth control pill was formulated by Dr. <PERSON> Gregoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pincus </PERSON> in 1960. `` The depression of male libido has been the problem in the past with male contraceptives,'' <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Dr. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biomedical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the study needed a much larger sample of people to determine if the injections would be effective. Six of the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> participants have finished a year-long series of injections without making their partners pregnant in that time. Researchers had hoped about half of the couples participating worldwide would go a full year without a pregnancy. So far, about three-fourths of the participants who have reached the full-year stage, about 70 men in six countries, have gone without a pregnancy, said <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON>. After 16 weeks of weekly injections, those men who develop no sperm are asked to discontinue all forms of contraception except for the weekly injections. The weekly injections then are continued for a year. <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> said TE can not be taken orally because the liver would destroy the drug's effectiveness. Other methods besides injections have not been tested yet, he said. <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> said side effects of TE include a weight gain averaging about six pounds and, in some cases, acne may occur in men who were acne-prone in their younger years. The <ORGANIZATION> UW </ORGANIZATION> is one of nine institutions worldwide, and the only one in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, working to develop an injectable male contraceptive, <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> said. The research is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Contraceptive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

 New Yorkers may soon be able to donate money to the homeless the same way they contribute to wildlife programs _ by checking a box on their state tax returns. The proposal before the legislature is patterned after the state's `` Return a Gift to Wildlife'' tax check-off, which annually raises $ 2 million for wildlife programs. `` I believe that New Yorkers are at least, if not more, concerned for the homeless men, women and children who are endangered species on city streets as they are for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s ridley sea turtle,'' said sponsor Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Padavan </PERSON>.

The embassy wives applauded <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> `` Swift Arrow'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a young <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Carolina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherokee </PERSON> who performed an intricate hoop dance, and <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Roanhorse </PERSON>, a Navajo from <LOCATION> Chinle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, who is Miss Indian U.S.A.. She performed a `` swan dance'' which she said reflected `` the Indian philosophy of being in harmony with nature. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> told the lunch guests that American Indians bear no resemblance to the Hollywood stereotype of the warring `` noble savage'' or the drunken bum. Like the peoples of foreign countries, he said, `` we're all concerned about our children, our homes and our livelihoods, and we're proud of our homelands.'' <PERSON> Wil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, the foundation's chief executive officer, invited the embassy wives to attend a major auction of American Indian arts and crafts here in November to raise money for construction of an Indian cultural and performing arts center in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` All the people of the world can benefit from exposure to the values and diversity of American Indian culture,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dolphins' Illness Created By Stress From Crowds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three bottlenose dolphins that developed ulcers shortly after arriving at the National Aquarium had something in common with many of the tourists watching them: They did n't like crowds. <PERSON> Kibby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aphrodite </PERSON> became ill from the stress of being unable to escape the hordes of people lining their tank, a researcher said Wednesday. They recovered within six months after being sent home to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Unfortunately, `` the farthest point they could get away to in the tank was still within their ` flight distance,''' the distance to which they would flee from the crowds, if they could, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoskopf </PERSON>, chief of medicine at the aquarium from 1981 to 1988 and a professor of comparitive medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. His study is awaiting publication by the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. In July 1982, barely a year after the aquarium opened, the dolphins were flown home to Grassy Key, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where they have been on exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION> Dolphin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The multimillion-dollar dolphin tank was never used for dolphins again. But the lessons they taught scientists guided the selection of beluga whales as the dolphins' replacements, and the manner in which the belugas were moved from the wild to captivity, <PERSON> Stoskopf </PERSON> said. `` We learned things about the animals that will help to make not only their lives in captivity better, but may also make their lives in the wild better,'' <PERSON> Stoskopf </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stoskopf </PERSON> and his associates watched the dolphins' behaviors and where they took place, looking for relationships between behavior and possible stress factors in the tank. `` We looked at everything we thought could be stressful to them, such as the configuration of the tank, temperature, being watched by the public, light levels and noise from the pumps,'' he said. The results showed `` the real problem with the exhibit was the people.'' When the aquarium was crowded, almost 98 percent of the dophins' activity was in parts of the tank away from people As the number of visitors increased, the animals began showing abnormal `` stereotypic'' behaviors. Crowds at the newly opened aquarium were three times what had been expected, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, the aquarium's director of operations and husbandry. `` The building was open until 2 a.m., and then it had to be cleaned. The lights never went out,'' he said. The dolphins retreated as far as they could, but researchers found that by fleeing from the crowds, the mammals congregated in a spot where noise from the tank's pumps was loudest. For replacements, officials settled on beluga whales, arctic mammals that are accustomed to very long or very short periods of daylight. `` We also thought it would be better to acclimate the animals slowly to a new home,'' <PERSON> Stoskopf </PERSON> said. The dolphins had been brought to the aquarium too soon after being captured, with little time to adjust to captivity or people. The belugas, <PERSON> Anore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Illamar </PERSON>, spent their first year in a quiet tank at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquarium </LOCATION> and were introduced slowly to larger numbers of people. Today they `` seem to be very happy,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. They were joined last summer by a third whale.

<HEAD>Bush: Gorbachev's Latest Proposal Good, but not Good Enough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s latest proposal to reduce conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could make the world safer but was not enough to erase the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's `` massive advantage'' over <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a commencement address at the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer confirms `` what we've known all along _ that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> military power far exceeds the levels needed to defend the legitimate security interests of the U.S.S.R.'' Officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday proposed the imposition of ceilings on Soviet forces stationed in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and outlined possible reductions in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> conventional arms as well. More broadly, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the newly commissioned officers that, internationally, he sees `` the ascendancy of the democratic idea.'' The world, he said, is `` witnessing the end of an idea: the final chapter of the communist experiment. `` Communism is now recognized, even by many within the communist world itself, as a failed system, one that promised economic prosperity but failed to deliver the goods, a system that built a wall between the people and their political aspirations.'' And, in some of his most pointed comments yet on the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took note of the pro-democracy demonstrators who have jammed <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square for nearly two weeks and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will do all it can to encourage'' those who `` are speaking the language of democracy and freedom.'' But the bulk of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech dealt with relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the prospects for mutual arms reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, now the subject of negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` The Soviets are now being forthcoming, and we hope to achieve the reductions that we seek,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But he challenged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to disclose accurate figures on Soviet military spending. `` Open the ledger,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the graduates that `` for more than 40 years, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's massive advantage in conventional forces has cast a shadow over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Now, he said, `` The unilateral reductions President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has promised give us hope that we can now redress that imbalance. We welcome those steps because, if implemented, they will help to reduce the threat of surprise attack.'' But he reiterated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must maintain a strong force of European-based nuclear weapons to counter the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's conventional arms superiority. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed _ but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected _ talks aimed at mutual reductions of European-based nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it would be `` irresponsible to depend solely on strategic -LRB- long-range -RRB- nuclear forces to deter conflict in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leaves Friday for next week's 40th anniversary meeting of leaders of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, with the future of the alliance's nuclear force an still-unresolved point of contention between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> wants the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to take the Soviets up on their request for talks on short-range nuclear weapons and is also pushing to reverse plans to modernize the arsenal of short-range nuclear weapons on German soil. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the Soviets have such an advantage in those weapons that cuts beyond what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> unveiled two weeks ago must be made before talks can begin on mutual reductions. As for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s newest proposal to reduce conventional arms, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advisers took a largely positive stance. `` We find this very promising,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` These are major, major concessions that put them more in line with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal.'' <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had given Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> a general outline of the Soviet proposals when the two met earlier this month. Then, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said, `` They were vague. Now they've put more meat on it.'' Also on Wednesday, the White House released the transcipt of an interview between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> journalists. In the interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the massive protests in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and political reform movements in other parts of the world show `` the democratic way is on the march and it is not going to be stopped.'' Still, the president cautioned, `` I'm old enough to remember <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in 1956 and I do n't want to be a catalyst for encouraging a course of action that would inevitably lead to violence and bloodshed.'' In the New <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` never before has the idea of freedom so captured the imaginations of men and women the world over _ and never before has the hope of freedom beckoned so many. `` Trade unionists in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Rulers consulting the ruled in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And even as we speak today, the world is transfixed by the dramatic events in Tiananmen Square. `` Everywhere those voices are speaking the language of democracy and freedom. And we hear them. And the world hears them. And <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will do all it can to encourage them.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, reflecting the fast-changing developments on the arms talk front, made extensive revisions in his speech, both before and after attending a banquet for <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> photographers Tuesday night and this morning as he flew here in a small <LOCATION> Gulfstream </LOCATION> jet. The last-minute revisions may have contributed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stumbling over one passage, where he repeated the word `` security'' three times and finally told the audience, `` The text is going crazy on this machine'' _ his prompter

 Democratic congressional leaders, unable themselves to convince President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to sign legislation raising the minimum wage above what he has proposed, brought three low-wage workers to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Wednesday and gave them a shot at changing the president's mind. `` Raise the minimum wage so we can live a little better and have a little more,'' said <PERSON> Eula </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, who said a custodial company she works for has paid her the minimum wage for 18 years. `` We're not asking for you to give us anything,'' she said. `` We want to work for it.'' The unusual forum was hosted by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, which traditionally holds private meetings to plot strategy and hear from people who would be affected by pending legislation. Wednesday's session was opened to reporters as part of the leadership's effort to pressure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to sign the measure. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised the bill that has cleared <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which would raise the minimum wage from $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.55 by October 1991, will be vetoed when it reaches his desk. The president proposed a $ 4.25 hourly minimum wage by 1992. Democrats urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to change his stance frequently remind the president that the last time the minimum wage was increase was in January 1981. Mrs. <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> put it more simply. `` We have n't had a raise since President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was in there,'' she said. Also at the forum was Verlie Reed, a receptionist at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> community center whose hourly pay jumped from $ 3.35 to $ 3.70 because <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> increased its state minimum wage. `` We're still working on a poverty income,'' she said. `` I think it's a disgrace, it's not right and something needs to be done.'' House Democratic leaders, who applauded each of the three witnesses at the hearing, also fired a few salvos at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` This scandalous neglect of hard-working <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers has contributed to the rise of a new underclass in our society _ the working poor and working homeless,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., the caucus chairman `` We're trying to do justice to millions of American workers who depend on the minimum wage,'' added <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Arab leaders remained bitterly divided Wednesday over a proposal to send a joint police force to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to replace Syrian troops that support Moslem forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year civil war. Despite that rift, and another argument over the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the summit of the 22-nation <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> appeared significantly to smooth relations between some of the Arab world's most bitter foes. President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent a message to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the conference chairman, expressing hope the summit would `` strengthen the possibility'' of an Arab-Israeli peace settlement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders to support the peace initiatives of both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. He also stressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for league efforts to halt the fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The summit convened Tuesday to welcome <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> back to the Arab fold after a 10-year ostracism for making peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It was to end Wednesday, but Moroccan delegates said the dispute over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> threatened to delay the closing by 24 hours. Leaders met behind closed doors and at private meetings Tuesday and Wednesday but made no progress. The summit convened for only five minutes before it adjourned. Another session for heads of delegations only was set for early evening. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war had been dormant for nearly four years when fighting erupted March 8 between Syrian-backed Moslem forces and Christians supported by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> moved quickly to restore his country's leading role in Arab politics by offering a proposal on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> jointly with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. They proposed that all 15,000 Syrian soldiers withdraw from the Moslem sector of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital, to be replaced by a joint <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> police force that also would deploy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian sector, conference sources said on condition of anonymity. About 25,000 Syrian soldiers police the rest of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They suggested the force be drawn from all Arab League member states, except traditional rivals <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` There is no talk about the size of the force yet. First, they -LRB- <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> -RRB- must agree to the idea,'' said one source. Other sources said the reluctance of some <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> members to send troops to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> could undermine the plan. Arab leaders also had planned to discuss recent developments concerning the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wants the Arabs to back his peace overtures, including his recent recognition of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s message said: `` The <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION> summit offers the Arab League the possiblity of strengthening the prospectives of a peace settlement by approving the measures taken by the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> ... by recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renouncing terrorism unequivocally.'' It also asked the Arabs not to hinder <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s plan for elections in the occupied territories. `` The summit can give encouragement to the elections,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Or, if it can not achieve this, it can at least avoid measures which would only add to the obstacles which we face already.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s main Arab foe, is expected to express reservations over the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader's peace moves, conference sources said. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> invited some quarreling leaders to a private meeting at his palace late Tuesday. Among those he persuaded to shake hands were <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>, and everyone with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> had threatened a boycott because of <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s presence. But he surprised reporters and observers Wednesday by arriving with the Egyptian leader and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> in <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s limousine. An Algerian delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> reconciled <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> during a 3 -LCB- - hour meeting

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Wednesday endorsed a bill allowing federal regulation of the prices charged an increasingly confused and angry traveling public by the proliferation of new phone companies for operator services. The bill, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee on a voice vote, would require the operator-services companies to clearly identify themselves, provide rates to callers, not charge for incompleted calls and ensure that credit-card callers are billed at their long-distance companies' rates if they so choose The bill was amended to force such companies to file a list of their prices with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> finds a company's rates to be unreasonable, the company then must justify their charges. The bill also would require the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether the operator-services industry as a whole is charging just and reasonable rates. If not, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> would decide how to establish rate regulation for the industry. The bill now goes to the full <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where it is expected to pass and be sent to the full House. Operator-services companies typically lease long-distance lines from the major long-distance carriers and then contract with such operations as airports, motels, hospitals and schools to provide service. In most cases, the companies pay airports and other customer a commission on each call handled from their phones. The FCC has received 2,000 complaints about operator-services companies, mostly regarding prices, which sometimes can be two or three times the rates charged by the long-distance carriers themselves. But the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in February said there was not enough evidence that companies were charging excessively and instead told the companies to post their names and telephone numbers on pay phones, stop blocking callers from using the long-distance carrier of their choice and stop billing customers from cities other than where the calls are made. The House bill includes similar provisions. But Rep. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, said the bill also orders the pricing investigation because of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` wholly inadequate'' response to the raft of complaints. The subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the bill was a response to `` a litany'' of complaints from consumers `` who innocently picked up pay phones and made calls which resulted in charges 250 percent higher than their regular long-distance rates. `` For the first time in its 100-year history the public pay phone has become an instrument of confusion and frustration,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> added. `` A constituent recently told me she was afraid to use her local phone booth because she did not know what to expect in her next month's phone bill. This morning's action should end the fear and the guesswork.''

<HEAD>Millions of Idled Crop Acres Being Put Back to Work</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers are putting millions of idled crop acres back to work this year, according to new signup figures for 1989 commodity programs announced Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Under this year's programs, farmers will idle 29.2 million acres, little more than half of the 54.2 million acres contracted to be taken from crop production under the 1988 programs, officials said. Despite the decline from last year, the prospective 1989 idled acreage would represent an area larger than the state of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. To be eligible for federal price support and related benefits, farmers are required to take a percentage of their base acres from crop production and put the land in conservation uses that help protect the soil. Last year's drought cut production severely, triggering higher grain prices and a drain on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpiles. The department eased idling requirements for this year's crops in an effort to rebuild inventories. The idled or `` diverted'' acres signed up for 1989 included: corn, 10 million acres, down from 28 million signed up for 1988; sorghum, 2.8 million acres, down from 4.1 million; barley, 2.1 million acres, down from 2.9 million; and oats, 300,000 acres, unchanged. In all, feed grains acres signed up to be idled under the 1989 programs totaled 15.2 million acres, down from 28.2 million contracted last year. Additionally, wheat farmers signed up to idle 9.5 million acres this year, compared with 22.8 million acres in 1988; cotton, 3.4 million acres, up from 2.1 million; and rice, 1.1 million acres, unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report said farmers enrolled 168.1 million acres of feed grain, wheat, cotton and rice in the 1989 program, which represented 76.3 percent of the 220.3 million acres in the national base area for those crops. The idled acres are part of the 168.1 million acres that were enrolled. Last year's gross enrollment was 187.8 million acres, which represented 83.4 per cent of the 1988 national base of 225.2 million acres.

<HEAD>Farmland Prices Rising for Third Consecutive Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices of farmland nationally are going up for the third consecutive year and may rise more than many analysts were saying a few months ago, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showed Wednesday. The farmland forecast was included briefly in a report on agricultural income and finance by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. It said values `` continue to rise and could advance 7 percent to 9 percent this year.'' A tentative forecast made last December called for a farmland value gain this year of around 2 percent to 4 percent. The agency announced last month that farmland values, including buildings, rose nationally in 1988 by 6 percent to an average of $ 597 per acre, the second consecutive increase. Farmland prices sank to a 19-year low of $ 548 per acre in 1986 before turning up in 1987. `` With real estate now accounting for about three-quarters of the farm sector's total assets, movements in land values dramatically affect net worth,'' the report said. `` Coupled with stable debt, higher land values could add $ 40 billion to the wealth of the farm sector.''

 On the night he vanished, film producer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> stepped into a limousine with a drug dealer after arranging for actor <PERSON> Demond </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to follow him with a gun, <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s former assistant testified Wednesday. But the signals for the actor to follow an apparently frightened <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> got mixed up at the last minute, <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s assistant, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, testified in a hearing on the so-called `` Cotton Club murder.'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said he saw another, unidentified car take off in pursuit of the limousine, and never saw <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> again. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> testified at a preliminary hearing in Municipal Court to determine if the drug dealer, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>, and three men should stand trial for the 1983 kidnapping and murder of <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>. Prosecutors allege <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> was killed because of a disagreement over how to split anticipated profits from the movie `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' with Ms. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> production chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said that on the last night of <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s life, the 33-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessman had a series of arguments with Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>, who was known then as <PERSON> Laynie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. He said they argued over missing cocaine and over Miss <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' share in profits from `` <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' She had introduced <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> to <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and the two were negotiatng a deal for the movie about the legendary <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> nightspot of the 1930s. `` There was a discussion of her remaining as part of the ` <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>' deal, and she expected to get her -LRB- $ 50,000 -RRB- finder's fee for making the introduction,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> testified. `` <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> said something about, ` Yes, if it all goes through.''' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said he had planned to drive <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scala </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> for dinner. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, formerly the star of television's `` Sanford and Son,'' was waiting outside with a gun, ready to follow <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>'s car. But Ms. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> arrived in a limousine and insisted <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> ride with her to the restaurant, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> testified. He said he walked outside and tried to signal <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, but was unsure that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> saw the signal. `` As I turned, lights came on on a car parked up from the hotel. It pulled away from the hotel and pulled into the traffic lane the limousine was in,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> testified. That was the last time <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> saw <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>, whose bullet-riddled body was found a month later in a dry riverbed 65 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Another witness has said the plan was for Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> to lure <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> into the limousine, stop at some point, get out and let two men who were following replace her in the car. Prosecutors allege that Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> hatched the murder conspiracy along with three former bodyguards of Hustler magazine publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>. They are <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Molony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamota </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> is fighting extradition in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> predicted Wednesday that barnyard animals in the 21st century may include genetically engineered livestock that are naturally resistant to disease.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told graduating cadets at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that a revolution in military affairs will require `` new military organizations and new methods of warfare.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the 1,011 cadets that their job was to `` maintain a military establishment that is respected by friend and adversary alike'' and said that because of their training he was confident they would meet that challenge. The vice president said he expects a revolution in military affairs over the next 10 to 15 years that will `` require us to develop new operational concepts, new military organizations and new methods of warfare.'' A new strategic planning tool created by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, called Competitive Strategies, will help `` identify, develop and field the weapons systems we need to be competitive with our major adversary and to understand how those weapons might be used operationally,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was sheltered by a canopy during his 10-minute speech while the cadets and their families stood and sat in a steady and often-heavy rain. He said the best and shortest speech he could come up with would have only two words: `` Beat <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.'' The crowd responded with thunderous applause. He noted that two graduating cadets from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> who he had appointed to the academy made the dean's list, `` something I was unable to do.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s academic record, which reportedly was below average, was questioned extensively during the 1988 presidential campaign. The vice president also praised the cadets' parents for their support, understanding and encouragement and called families `` the bedrock of our society.'' `` This is particularly evident on occasions such as these, which are in effect celebrations of our families and of their role in instilling values in succeeding generations of young Americans,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. After the diplomas were handed out, the cadets gave the traditional hat toss.

 More than 20 percent of the costs consultants charged to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in 1988 were deemed `` questionable,'' with fees for advertising and lobbying mixed into the bills, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> audit released Wednesday. `` If the taxpayers knew they were footing the bill for large defense contractors to pay for lobbying, lawsuits, advertising and constant reorganizations, there would be an uproar,'' Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., said in releasing the report The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, in a study of 118 audits, found that of the $ 269 million in consultant costs charged to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, contracts worth $ 53.7 million were considered `` questionable.'' Among the charges were $ 2.2 million for executive or legislative lobbying and about $ 440,000 for unallowable public relations and advertising. The highest cost was $ 33.8 million for `` lack of adequate agreement @ work product.'' These costs were incurred because a defense contractor did not have a written agreement with the consultant. `` This type of loosely monitored buddy system is what created the need for last year's Ill Wind investigation,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said. `` I can only hope that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> learns from these <ORGANIZATION> DCAA </ORGANIZATION> audit reports and improves its management of its contractors.'' The audit agency recommended that defense contractors correct the deficiencies in their system of estimating, approving and accounting for consultant costs. The Pentagon is reviewing federal acquisition regulations covering the definition, allowability and documentation requirements for consultant costs.

<TEXT>
 More than 500 leaders of the Puerto Rican community met Wednesday at the start of a convention aimed at improving what they called `` desperate social conditions'' facing the 2.5 million Puerto Ricans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` They're living in dire poverty, families are shaking at the seams,'' said <PERSON> Zorlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for Puerto Rican Rights. `` We've made very little progress in this country over the last 50 years.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members issued a report outlining the status of Puerto Ricans in the mainland <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> showing that 38 percent of the families live at or below the official poverty line. The report also said 44 percent of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> families are headed by single mothers, the majority of whom live at the poverty level. `` Those of us who are here, those of us who were born here, feel we are not sharing in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' said <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amy-Moreno </PERSON>, a professor and historian and a member of the local <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> chapter. `` Some of us live in the worst conditions in this country,'' she said. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> and Amy-Moreno were among the Puerto Rican leaders who addressed the start of the fifth National Puerto Rican convention Wednesday. The majority of Puerto Ricans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> live in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> or nearby. Other large groups are concentrated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The report contained mostly discouraging news about life among Puerto Ricans on the mainland. Among the other findings: _ Official unemployment for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ricans </LOCATION> is almost double that of the general working age population in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ AIDS is the leading cause of death among Hispanic men in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where most Puerto Ricans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are found _ <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> families have incomes that are less than half those of non-Hispanics _ Few Puerto Ricans own property and spend much of their incomes on rent _ Only 53 percent of Puerto Ricans over 25 have attended four years of college, compared with 75 percent for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> general population `` Puerto Ricans, as well as other Latinos and African Americans, have benefited the least from the expansion which has characterized the economy since the recession of the early 1980s,'' the report concluded. But <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said there are signs of progress, some of which were sparked by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, formed in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in 1981. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> now has more than seven chapters countrywide. `` We've provided a forum for Puerto Ricans to discuss the most pressing problems facing the community and how to deal with them,'' said <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>. Puerto Ricans in this country have tried to better their lot with labor, convention officials said. Many Puerto Rican workers at a major Wall Street firm have joined with other minority employees to demand equal opportunity and more hiring of Hispanics. The United Third Bridge, a group of Puerto Rican workers within Local 3 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, has taken the union to court for failing to defend them against discrimination in construction.

<HEAD>Bill Would Require Colleges To Say How Many Athletes Graduate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bill requiring colleges to disclose how many of their athletes graduate could improve education standards for student athletes, a congressman and former pro basketball player said Wednesday. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON>, D-Md., a sponsor of the `` Student-Athlete Right to Know Act,'' called the effort `` a relatively innocuous consumer information bill, designed to provide the students and parents with valuable information about the school they are considering. <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON> played for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> before playing professionally with the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Bullets. In testimony submitted to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, he said the disclosure bill itself will not ensure that athletes get the education they deserve but could help `` to move us back towards the primary goal of educating young people and to developing basic standards for student-athletes.'' The right-to-know measure, sponsored by former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knicks </ORGANIZATION> star Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would require schools receiving federal assistance to report on the graduation rates of their athletic-scholarship recipients and compare their rate with that of the general student population. Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on postsecondary education, heard testimony on the bill last week and again at the hearing Wednesday The Rev. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, offered a number of recommendations including reducing the college basketball season by five weeks and not allowing freshmen to play. He said every school should publish graduation rates and require that graduation rates for athletic teams must be equivalent to rates for the entire school. <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> also recommended consideration of another idea, to limit athletic scholarships based on players' failure to graduate `` Anything would be better than we have today,'' <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said in his testimony. The chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Massengale </PERSON>, said the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has drafted its own version of right-to-know legislation. He said <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> members will consider it at a convention in January. There are several serious issues to be resolved, including which institutions should have to report and what type of data they need to submit and to whom, <PERSON> Massengale </PERSON> said in testimony submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel. He also said it is unclear whether data should be reported by race `` as suggested in the <LOCATION> Bradley-McMillen </LOCATION> bill,'' adding many institutions would find such a requirement offensive, and in some cases it night cause legal problems. `` These are all legitimate questions, even for one who believes in the fundamental concept of disclosure,'' <PERSON> Massengale </PERSON> said.

 In what could have been a sequel to `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>,'' New Yorkers formed bread lines on Wednesday to buy loaves of real Russian rye flown in from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We're selling it at a rate of one loaf every two minutes; right now, the line is very long,'' said <PERSON> Miraed </PERSON> <PERSON> Peake </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, where 1,100 loaves arrived Tuesday night. `` One person came in and bought 14 loaves,'' she said. Among the buyers were employees from the Soviet mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` The bread is good. It's not a gimmick,'' Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` But Americans also seem to be fascinated with Russian items.'' Yes, but they're still Americans, and any resemblance to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ends at the rear of the bread line. Competition broke out before the bread had even arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and a chain of bakeries is already planning to undercut <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s price _ a hefty $ 6 for each two-pound loaf. The dense bread was made in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday, shipped Sunday night, arrived Monday via <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, underwent federal inspections and arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s on Tuesday. `` That's what we're planning to do every week, assuming it continues to sell well,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Two varieties are offered from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Factory No. 10: <PERSON> Rjanog </PERSON>, a sour rye, recommended with Russian tea, and <PERSON> Borodinsky </PERSON>, a sweeter bread with coriander seeds. They stay fresh three to four days in a regular bread box and will `` last forever'' when frozen, Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Millionaire entrepreneur <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON>, 58, struck the deal that brought the `` peace bread'' to <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, the <LOCATION> Waldorf-Astoria </LOCATION> hotel, the Russian Tea Room and the Rye Town Hilton -LRB- which was n't renamed for the bread; it's in the town of Rye just north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> -RRB- When <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON> announced the import plan in March during a taste-test at the <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, he said it would be sold at 15 <PERSON> Zaro </PERSON>'s Bread Basket stores in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area Therein lies the capitalist rub. <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zaro </PERSON>'s had a falling out. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaro </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bakery, said it was over money. <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON> was vague about the reasons, but said his talks with <PERSON> Mosinter </PERSON>, an economic association of the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, had bogged down because of the Soviet bureaucracy. <PERSON> Zaro </PERSON>'s made its own contract with <PERSON> Mosinter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON> stopped negotiating with that agency and quickly made a deal for <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s through <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, a new Soviet-West German venture run by `` one of the new breed of perestroika entrepreneurs.'' `` It's an interesting metaphor for the future. I negotiated 7 -LCB- months with the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bureaucracy and in 7 days I made a deal with a Soviet entrepreneur,'' said <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zaro </PERSON> said the Soviets have promised him 2,000 loaves on Saturday. He'll sell it for $ 1 less than <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. `` Let's see what happens Saturday; I do n't see how it will get through,'' said <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON>. `` The bottom line is that the Russian black bread is sitting in <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s now.'' Both retailers said they'll seek more deals with the Soviets. <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON> said he was working on more imports for <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s _ he would n't give specifics. <PERSON> Zaro </PERSON> said his father, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, who is company chairman and <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON>'s next-door neighbor, will leave for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Tuesday to discuss selling a product or opening a store there. The competitors also will have a product name in common: `` peace bread.'' `` It has nothing to do with what went on between us and <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Zaro </PERSON>. `` It obviously is referring to the two nations.''

 They may not rank up there with the works of <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION> Matisse </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s Etch-A-Sketch masterpieces are drawing rave reviews at the <ORGANIZATION> Burbank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's incredible,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> as he gazed at an elaborate drawing of a knight battling a scaly dragon outside a brick medieval castle. `` I've been doing Etch-A-Sketch since I was little and all I can draw is a face.'' While the art world reels from an insatiable demand for big-name creations such as `` <PERSON> Yo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>,'' the self-portrait which recently sold for $ 47 million, the visionary <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> is plotting a new artistic course. Equipped with a standard toy-store-issue Etch-A-Sketch, <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> meticulously moves the horizontal and vertical knobs on the red 5-by-7 inch `` magic screen'' filled with metallic powder. Soon, Voila! The little black squiggle that has kept kids quiet in the back seat for three decades becomes another Vidal Original. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> -LRB- and that's his real name -RRB- was n't always an accomplished Etch-A-Sketcher. `` It was always easy for me to draw complicated work. I thought I could get into any medium _ pencils, paint, oil. But here was this Etch-A-Sketch and I could n't get it to work for a darn,'' said <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>. But the freelance carpenter and artist mastered the Etch-A-Sketch so it now takes him 15 minutes to draw a portrait, although up to 25 hours for a more complex work. He said he has bought several hundred of the toys over the years, and several of the drawings on display are more than a decade old. `` I've sold several pieces of artwork _ anywhere from eight to 10 of them _ mostly to friends and acquaintances,'' he said. `` It's unique. I get more response out of this medium. You have to use two hands to use this. It's a toy, and everyone is aware of this toy. And I can carry it with me.'' Although his pictures of a housing development, reptiles, the Beatles and <ORGANIZATION> Darth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vader </ORGANIZATION> have n't yet made it to the Louvre or the National Gallery of Art, the sketchings are prompting open-mouth amazement at the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> library, where they are on sale at prices ranging from $ 200 to $ 5,000. `` It's incredible,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahikina </PERSON>, repeating a common utterance by viewers of the Etch-A-Sketch art. `` All I could do is draw a square.'' The etchings are exhibited flat in a glass case, propped up ever so slightly because of the delicate nature of the toy. The board erases when it is shaken or turned over _ a feature that's nice for kids, potentially disastrous for <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>. Once, he recalled, he had to brake sharply in his car and an Etch-A-Sketch fell off the seat. `` It was a loss,'' <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> said. Special care will be taken next month when the <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> etching collection is moved down the street for its next engagement at the Brand Art and Music Library in nearby <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>. Could the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> of Contemporary Art be next? Etch-A-Sketch went on the market in 1960 for $ 2.98. It has become one of the most popular children's toys ever, having sold more than 50 million since its introduction and continuing to sell about 2 million a year at its current $ 8.99 cost, said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, vice president of development and marketing for The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures the toy. `` We're now into our third generation of Etch-A-Sketch. Mothers bought them for their children and now those children are mothers buying it for their children,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> is not alone in his hobby. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said there is an Etch-A-Sketch art club with 25,000 members.

 The fuel-economy standard for 1989 passenger cars will remain at 26.5 miles per gallon, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in rejecting a petition for reconsideration of the regulation. The petition filed by two Washington-based advocacy groups, the Center for <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, asked <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> to allow the corporate average fuel economy standard to revert to 27.5 mpg, the level set by a 1975 law intended to reduce dependence on foreign oil. The advocacy groups failed to make a case that `` the standard should have been set at a level other than 26.5 mpg,'' <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s order said In their petition, the organizations argued that contrary to <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s findings, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' fuel-economy goals remaned unmet. The organizations said <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> erred in determining that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest automaker, could only meet at 26.5 mpg standard and in blaming declining <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> sales on the fuel-economy standards. The petition put <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> in a position of defending the 26.5 mpg fuel-economy standard after <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said last week he would allow the standard to revert to 27.5 mpg for the 1990 model year. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said then he hoped the stiffer standard would encourage the automakers to make more efficient cars. `` If the agency had applied the same standards to 1989 as it did to 1990, it would have kept the standard at 27.5 mpg,'' said <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON>, director of the Center for Auto Safety. `` Today's decision is simply inconsistent with last week's decision by Secretary <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> One of the two decisions has to be wrong, and we're sure Secretary <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was wrong this week and right last week.'' The fuel economy standards require each automaker's fleet of passenger cars, on average, to attain a certain gas mileage. The 1975 law set a gradually rising scale of fuel economy that must be met, with the goal of reaching 27.5 mpg, but also allowed <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s parent agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, to loosen the minimum standard through administrative order to account for economic and technical factors. The standard was loosened under that provision to 26 mpg in 1986 at the request of the automakers, and remained there until 1989.

<TEXT>
 One of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s most notorious Nazi collaborators was arrested Wednesday and charged with crimes against humanity after spending most of four decades in hiding. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON>, captured at a priory in <LOCATION> Nice </LOCATION>, faces trial for crimes he allegedly committed while leading the pro-Nazi French militia in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, where he worked closely with <ORGANIZATION> Gestapo </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON>, 74, was captured Wednesday morning in <LOCATION> Nice </LOCATION> and flown to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for questioning, police said. He was taken in a guarded fire department ambulance to the Palais de Justice where he was charged, and then transferred to a prison in <LOCATION> Fresnes </LOCATION>, south of the capital. The French news agency Agence France-Presse, quoting neighbors who witnessed the arrest, said <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> was taken into custody at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Priory </LOCATION>, which is run by followers of excommunicated Monsignor <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefevbre </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> expelled the right-wing fundamentalist priest last year after a long battle over church doctrine. `` We see this with great satisfaction,'' said <PERSON> Beate </PERSON> <PERSON> Klarsfeld </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s best-known Nazi hunter. `` It's a great bravo for French justice.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Klarsfeld </PERSON> was instrumental in tracking down <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>, who in 1987 was sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity. <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> was arrested when <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was liberated, but he escaped. He was convicted twice and sentenced to death in absentia for executing and torturing members of the resistance. He managed to stay hidden until the sentences against him expired under a 20-year statute of limitations. In 1971, President <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Pompidou </PERSON> quietly pardoned <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON>. New charges were raised two years later, however, and the collaborator again became a fugitive. <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON>'s protection during the early postwar period by senior members of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy has been extensively documented, and historian <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Amouroux </PERSON> said his trial would bring out `` the role the church played.'' Monsignor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Duquaire </PERSON>, who was private secretary to the archbishop of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> during the occupation, urged <PERSON> Pompidou </PERSON> to pardon <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON>, who had lived in a succession of monasteries in the southern <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> region. One account, by the <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> journalist and historian <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Merindol </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Duquaire </PERSON> was fulfilling a pledge in return for <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> securing the release of 42 hostages about to be shot by the Germans in retaliation for an act of sabotage. When asked to comment on the arrest, Cardinal <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decourtray </PERSON>, current archbishop of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, said he hoped `` the respect for others will prevail over lies and settling of accounts.'' Written accounts suggest <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> could expose prominent Frenchmen as collaborators. Similar fears were expressed before <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>'s trial, but no revelations were made. The new arrest warrant against <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> lists six charges, including the killing of <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Basch </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators determined that when <PERSON> Basch </PERSON>, 81, and his wife, were arrested by <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON>'s militiamen in January 1944 they were `` judged too old to be deported and they were killed on the spot.'' A death notice for <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> was published in a <LOCATION> Grenoble </LOCATION> newspaper in 1984, giving thanks in the name of his family for expressions of sympathy. It was never explained, and there were frequent reports afterward that <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> was seen in monasteries in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Andre </PERSON>, 61, said in an interview he was surprised by the arrest because he had been `` 99 percent'' convinced his brother was dead. `` In a certain sense, his arrest is a good thing. The inquiry will show, even if he is not lily-white, that people have exaggerated and made a mythical figure out of him,'' <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nant </PERSON>, who was an 18-year-old resistance fighter when he says he was captured by the militia and tortured by <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> for 10 days in May 1944, said the collaborator should be brought to trial. `` He's 74 years old, time passes, but <PERSON> Touvier </PERSON> still has an account to settle with justice today,'' <PERSON> Nant </PERSON> said.

 The chief arms control negotiator under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday he was rebuffed in January when he urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to negotiate cuts in short-range nuclear missiles with the Soviets. `` It was my view that it is important to capture, to the extent that you can, the political initiative,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>, who left office May 2. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, headed for a summit of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> next Monday, is trying to end an alliance crisis involving the short-range missiles. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, whose party faces tough elections next year, wants <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to open immediate negotiations, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is pressing <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to agree to modernize the existing 88 Lance missile launchers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>, in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s course would gain no advantage for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and was putting the Germans in an impossible political position `` It appeared to me that we could well take the iniative and propose to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> that we ask the Soviets to join us in prompt neogiatiations on short-range missiles,'' said <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>. `` This propsal would be contingent on the German government agreeing to adhere to its previous position opposing the total elimination of short-range missiles, and to support us as we attempted to secure equal ceilings on such missiles to a level around 200 or 300 such missiles on each side,'' he said. `` I thought that the time was right in January to take this iniative to -LRB- Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> A. -RRB- <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. But it was rejected by him,'' said <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has a great superiority in such weapons today. And without an agreement providing for one-sided reductions by the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> levels, it will be able to maintain such superiority indefinitely in the future,'' <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> said. `` An exchange betweeen us in short-range missiles would be totally and one-sidely destructive for ourselves and our allies, primarily the Germans,'' he said. `` If the point is our ability to be able to initiate a nuclear attack regardless of its effectiveness, we have in the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> area a variety of nuclear weapons of every significant range. The true deterrent to Soviet attack in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on ourselves or our allies must be the great power and diversity of our strategic nuclear forces deployed at sea or based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> said he anticipates an agreement will be worked out. `` In the past 40 years, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has always appeared to be in more or less in dissarray,'' he said. `` The manifest and continuing threat from the East, and the essential reality of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to both the conventional and the nuclear deterrrence to that threat were evident and tended to overcome the centrifugal forces in the alliance in every crisis situation,'' he said. `` The view that the threat from the East has diminished to the unimportant is already widespread. Few credit that shift to the continuing strength and unity of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> when that was needed,'' <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Roughly 40 Percent Drop in Yellowstone's Northern Elk Herd</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hard winter and extended hunting season produced a decline of almost 40 percent in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>'s northern elk herd, according to biologists. Harvest of the animals during regular and late-season hunting accounted for 14 percent to 16 percent mortality, and 24 percent to 27 percent of the herd died from winter exposure, the biologists said. Earlier this year <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> biologist <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> had estimated that roughly one-third of the northern herd would die either from hunting or the winter weather. However, by early March nearly one-fourth of the herd had already died. A report issued by the biologists Tuesday said last year's forest fires and drought were followed by a winter of snow that ranged from 95 percent to 110 percent of normal Three separate arctic cold fronts contributed to the winter kill, the biologists said. Studies of carcasses this spring indicated that most of the dead elk were either elderly or calves. `` A large number of the survivors are prime-age reproductive animals,'' the report said. They said elk died in greater numbers than mule deer and antelope because no mule deer or antelope winter range was burned by the fires. The biologists based their figures on aerial counts of the herd, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s largest. In early winter the population was estimated at 18,506 to 20,358 head, while on Jan. 26 the number fell between 17,207 and 19,059. Counts in April following <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s late-season elk hunt outside the park placed the herd's population between 11,801 and 13,137 animals, according to the biologists. The counts suggested that almost 5,000 elk died from winter kill alone. Singer and fellow biologist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemke </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION>, Wildlife and <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, said in their report that it is impossible `` to separate the effects of drought and the fires of 1988 upon elk,'' since both factors affected summer and winter range. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday they have n't established any average mortality rate for the herd because they have conducted serious elk research only in the past couple years.

Businesses provide 98 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Medley </ORGANIZATION>'s tax earnings, according to Mayor <PERSON> Tobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. An estimated $ 400,000 a year, or 10 percent of the annual budget, goes into free services for residents. All residents in <LOCATION> Medley </LOCATION>, a dusty town jammed against the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, are entitled to a free hot lunch every weekday. One resident, <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arango </PERSON>, has accepted the offer every weekday for the past eight years. In addition to the free school bus rides for children and free van rides to the supermarket and beauty parlor, there are free car trips to the doctor's office and free pickup of medical prescriptions. Residents get free boat rides on the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. They pay nothing to swim in the town pool, lift weights in the gym, even receive health care and housekeepers in their homes. Kids can play video games all day long at the town's game room and never spend a quarter. And more services are on the way. Medley officials are planning to set up low-cost housing for less-privileged residents. Their efforts will be reported in the town's free weekly newspaper, delivered door to door. `` There's a lot of local stuff in there the people like to read,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` If people know what's going on, they usually complain less.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must change the War Powers Act, witnesses told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Wednesday with some suggesting measures to strengthen consultations between the executive and legislative branches and others calling for repeal of the Vietnam-era law. Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, R-Ky., told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on investigations that the law is flawed, but he cautioned against repealing it `` We have an obligation as lawmakers ... when we see something wrong to right it, when something is broken, fix it,'' said <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, the ranking Republican on the panel. Enacted in 1973 over the veto of then-President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, the law requires a presidential report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are sent into situations of `` imminent hostilities.'' Under some instances, the troops must be withdrawn after 60 or 90 days unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> votes to allow them to remain. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was fortunate that the War Powers Act was not invoked in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in 1987 when former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> allowed Kuwaiti-owned oil tankers to sail under the American flag and sent <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships to protect them from Iranian attack. According to <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could have taken advantage of the limited time the troops could remain in the gulf. The <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> mentioned legislation he introduced last year that would remove the provision automatically withdrawing forces and strengthen consultation between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president. The measure has been referred to the subcommittee for consideration, <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, who served on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, said he opposes the time limit of the War Powers Act and urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to alter the law. `` Do not be deterred by critics who say it's fine, leave it alone,'' said <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, who is the director of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> called for repeal of the War Powers Act, describing the law as `` irrelevant, illegal, incompetent, irresponsible and insensitive to the safety of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Armed Forces.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, associate director of the school's Center for Law and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, said the law was unconstitutional because it gives <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> powers delegated to the president. In a sharp attack, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` can not keep secrets. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not act with speed and dispatch,'' and should not have the authority of the executive branch, he added. The War Powers Act has been the subject of an ongoing battle between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In November 1983, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted to override <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s veto of the bill with supporters arguing that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s Vietnam War policies were usurping <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' constitutional right to declare war <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently indicated to him that he would be willing `` to open it up for some discussion'' on the War Powers Act.

<TEXT>
 Hampered by rules against motorized vehicles, firefighters are battling a fire in the heart of <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> that has burned more than 75,000 acres in an area that had n't burned in 30 years, officials said Wednesday. `` This has become a logistical nightmare,'' said park information officer <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON>. `` You have no roads. Federal laws prohibit the use of motorized vehicles, so this has become a major firefighter's nightmare. What looks flat when you're sitting in your car is the worst hiking.'' She said about 257 people, including `` hotshot'' teams of experienced firefighters from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, were battling the blaze, which has charred more than 75,000 acres. They use five helicopters to move personnel and dump water. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has been plagued by brush and grass fires during an unusually dry spring. Residents of metropolitan <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> have grown accustomed to a blanket of smelly smoke that sometimes covers the area, as it did Wednesday. <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> blaze is typical of early rainy season fires in the park. It was sparked by lightning May 16, and if rain in the area had been more evenly distributed, it might not have burned as long as it has. `` But rain is not yet general,'' she said. `` It may dump 6 inches here and none across the road. And the lightning struck out to the side in areas where it's really dry.'' The fire is roughly 30 mile southwest of downtown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON> said that particular area had n't burned over for about 30 years, giving the fire plenty of fuel. Officials had been worried that a Miccosukee Indian village in the park might be threatened, but the wind changed direction Wednesday morning. `` The distance to the village is still some 10 to 12 miles from the fire line itself,'' <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON> said, adding that some precautionary steps were being taken at the village `` as much to reassure the residents of their safety'' as to get ready for fire action. About 500 people live in the village along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 41, known as the <LOCATION> Tamiami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trail </LOCATION>, the southernmost route across the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> region. The wind shift may have been part of a weather change that could bring firefighters some help, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. `` There is a chance that we will get some rain on it and if it does occur it will be a heavy rain,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pifer </PERSON>, citing a combination of unstable air and warmth.

<HEAD>Mass Killer's Wife Awarded Record Libel Damages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A jury awarded the wife of British mass killer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON>, the so-called `` <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> Ripper,'' a record $ 942,000 in libel damages Wednesday against a satirical magazine, Private Eye. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hislop </PERSON>, editor of Private Eye, said the bimonthly may have to fold and declared, `` If this is justice, I'm a banana.'' <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON>, whose truck driver husband was jailed for life in 1981 for killing 13 women and attempting to kill five more, hurried from the court with a blanket over her head. The 200,000-circulation Private Eye was ordered to pay the damages for alleging that Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> sold her story to a tabloid newspaper for $ 392,000 after carousing with its reporters at a hotel. `` We are totally flabbergasted,'' said <PERSON> Hislop </PERSON>. `` I think this is very nearly the end of Private Eye. We can not possibly pay that amount of damages. We are going to launch a Ripper Balls Fund and try to raise some money -LRB- for an appeal -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Hislop </PERSON>, whose gossipy, muckraking magazine is often sued, complained the award was 100 times the average compensation paid to three of <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON>'s victims. The award to 38-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON>, who is legally separated from her husband, was the highest in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> given by a jury in a libel suit. The previous record was $ 831,000 awarded to novelist <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> in 1987 against <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tabloid newspaper that said he gave money to a prostitute. He said he never met her. Pop singer <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> won a record $ 1.84 million libel settlement from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top-selling newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, last year, but in an out-of-court settlment. Private Eye also will have to pay $ 157,000 in court costs. During the week-long hearing, Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> appeared composed as she told how she was pressured to tell her story after her husband's arrest. `` The press seemed to be everywhere, banging on the doors, shouting through the doors and banging on the windows,'' she said. `` They pushed notes through the windows offering money and shouted ` I'll top any offer.''' But she said she decided never to tell her story because she believed newspapers only wanted details of her sexual relations with her husband. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON>, who is held at a hospital for the criminally insane, killed the women over five years in the north <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> county of <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION>. At his trial, he said he believed God had ordered him to kill prostitutes. Private Eye first alleged in 1981 that Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> had made a deal with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. In 1983, it repeated the allegation. This year, after receiving her libel writ, it published two more articles that Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> said implied that she knew about her husband's crimes. During the trial, Private Eye accepted there was no deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> but argued the gist of the story was true. It said Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> had negotiated with newspapers and was prepared to capitalize on her husband's crimes. Private Eye, launched in 1961, is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s best-known satirical magazine with its chatty mix of gossip and satire along with reporting on scandal and corruption. Libel and legal fees have often bitten into its profits, and its founder and first editor, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingrams </PERSON>, once gave his recreation in Who's Who as `` litigation.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter-Ruck </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top libel lawyer, said the award showed juries were now determined to punish newspapers and magazines, as opposed to compensating the aggrieved. `` I think this award is disastrous,'' he said, adding that while big national newspapers could afford to pay huge damages, smaller publications will simply go out of business.

<HEAD>Crewman Says Poor Maintenance Led To Exxon-Chartered Tanker Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY McGRATH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Minor maintenance could have prevented a near-disaster involving an oil tanker that crashed into a concrete catwalk and stopped just short of a major oil transfer station in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, a crewman said. The Exxon-chartered oil tanker, the <LOCATION> Overseas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, was laden with 17 million gallons of crude oil at the time of the April 14 accident. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> are investigating the accident. <PERSON> Boatswain </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballentine </PERSON>, 32, said Tuesday that inadequate maintenance prevented the crew from dropping anchor and slowing the ship as it approached a <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> refinery at twice its normal speed. The tanker demolished a 100-foot section of catwalk. `` Another 50 feet down the dock and it would have been the largest explosion in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ballentine </PERSON> said outside the pilots board meeting. He said the anchors had not been greased properly. Swift action steered the bow of the boat away from the loading station and prevented a disastrous explosion inside the partially filled tanks, he said. An official of the company that owns the ship denied <PERSON> Ballentine </PERSON>'s charges and said the anchors had been greased properly. The ship had been en route to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to help replace the crippled <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> after it ran aground in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> on March 24, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of oil in the nation's worst spill. No one was injured in the April accident and the only damage to the ship was a large amount of concrete debris on deck. The ship continued on to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and is now headed back to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The board said the accident is under investigation and declined to discuss the matter or take testimony from <PERSON> Ballentine </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> says the cause has not been determined. The tanker was operated by <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and chartered by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, vice president of operations for Maritime Overseas, refused to discuss the accident but denied <PERSON> Ballentine </PERSON>'s charges of improper maintenance. `` I'm sure it will come out in the inquiry that the anchors were properly greased,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ballentine </PERSON> said he quit his job aboard the ship as a result of the accident. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said the boatswain had cited a medical reason for leaving. The Chevron refinery, which processes 365,000 barrels of oil a day, is the largest plant in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, and is linked to a major crude oil pipeline, said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Oil Spill Liability Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Wednesday approved a bill giving the federal government authority to determine damages to be paid by oil companies after spills. The measure approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee bars states from enacting stricter damage laws than the federal standard. The issue of state versus federal standard has been the chief hurdle over the past 13 years blocking legislation to simplify existing oil spill laws. The oil industry has favored having the federal government set damages. While the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly passed bills allowing federal standards, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has insisted that states be permitted to have stricter standards. The chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> supporter of that position has been <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, who has introduced a liability bill. The March 24 oil spill of the <LOCATION> Exxon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> has given new impetus to attempts to reach a compromise. `` I think for the first time we have an incredible momentum for a bill,'' said Rep. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. `` Billy'' <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee He explained that changes in wording may make the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure more acceptable to past opponents. States can now tax oil companies to obtain the money needed to clean up spills. If the bill is approved, the federal government would create by a clean-up fund bankrolled by a 1.3 cent per barrel tax on all imported oil. The bill is one of several in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> spawned by the Exxon Valdez accident, the nation's worst-ever oil spill. The giant tanker hit a well-marked reef, pouring 11 million gallons of crude oil into pristine Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The subcommittee also the Prince William Sound Oil Spill Response Act, which calls for better surveillance of vessels in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and stronger safety measures in case of a spill. The bill says a person's license to operate a vessel in the sound could be revoked if the individual was convicted of violating alcohol abuse laws. It states that licenses will not be issued or renewed if the person is a chronic alcohol abuser. Exxon announced March 31 that it had fired the Exxon Valdez captain, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, after federal investigators reported that his blood alcohol level was well above the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> maximum 10 hours after the accident. It was revealed that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> had a history of drunken driving convictions. In addition, the legislation authorizes a total of $ 15 million to study the environmental impact of the spill. It also authorizes another $ 5 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to improve its response to oil spills in Arctic waters and $ 3 million to the Maritime Administration for studies on the safety of tankers operating in Alaskan waters. In a third bill passed Wednesday, the subcommittee answered a problem being created by the administration's `` zero tolerance'' drug interdiction program. Commercial vessels siezed because illegal `` personal use'' drugs are found on board can be returned to their owners during the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation.

 Science is at the point where human diseases can be attacked on the molecular level, doctors said Wednesday at the opening of a $ 50 million center devoted to joining laboratory work and patient care. More than 20 international scientists, including five Nobel Prize winners, gathered at ceremonies and a symposium at the <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Molecular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think it's too far off base to say that the new era of genetic and molecular medicine will offer changes as significant to medical sciences as occurred more than 100 years ago when scientists discovered that bacteria were the underlying cause of disease,'' said Nobelist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, director of the center. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Korn </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s medical school, said the center has attracted at least 40 `` world-class medical scientists'' and would have an annual budget of $ 20 million to $ 40 million. The center, adjacent to <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, has brought together such researchers as molecular scientists and doctors specializing in pediatrics, infectious diseases and other areas. `` The right mind, looking at a frustrating clinical problem can often come up with an insight, which if transferred back into the right scientific environment, can open up a whole new field of research,'' <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> said. Other Nobel laureates at the symposium were <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltimore </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Whitehead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biomedical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>. Controlling genetic diseases, such as sickle cell anemia and certain cancers, through molecular genetics were among the papers presented at the three-day symposium. `` All along we've said that this line of research will lead to significant advances and benefits in medicine,'' said <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>. `` Now I think they are very close at hand. In the next decade, the impact of molecular genetics in medicine will be mind-boggling. I expect we'll see a succession of major breakthroughs in understanding and, ultimately, in dealing with human disease.'' Researchers in molecular and genetic medicine seek to understand human disease or physiology in terms of molecules and genes, <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said. `` The idea of the program is to reach out and encompass everybody who shares that same philosophical perspective,'' he said. The center and a few others like it will speed up application of research work because they provide `` a very necessary channel of communication between the patient and the laboratory,'' <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> said. `` It really is a two-way street. It is n't only from the laboratory to the bedside.'' Molecular biologists are probing genetic susceptibility in people to particular forms of arthritic disease and identifying certain kinds of cells that cause arthritic damage. The researchers are trying to inactivate those specific harmful cells without shutting down the whole immune system. The same strategy is being used in infantile diabetes and multiple sclerosis. There also is evidence that certain genetically designed growth hormones would allow doctors to push radiation therapy and chemotherapy to higher levels than ever in fighting cancer. The hormones would be used to protect and rescue the bone marrow from obliteration by the therapy. Another area of research is the search for a tiny group of powerful cells that, when activated by a hormone, specifically go after kidney cancers without injuring anything else. `` Talk about magic bullets! This is a kind of magic bullet that everybody's been looking for,'' <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> said. Still another frontier of research is the study of how cells in the nervous system communicate with each other on a molecular level. <PERSON> Korn </PERSON> cautioned against misinterpreting scientists' enthusiasm for breakthroughs in the laboratories, or successful tests with some patients, with promises of imminent cures for cancer and other diseases. `` I do think this is a revolution and I do think that molecular biology is going to have as profound effects on medicine as anything that's happened in the history of biological science,'' he said. `` But I'm not going to tell you that one year from now we will have cures for a lot of diseases.''

 Three Democratic lawmakers, saying too many former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials are going to work too soon for private defense firms they had dealings with while they were in the government, proposed on Wednesday to toughen the so-called revolving door regulations. Democratic Reps. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> introduced legislation to prevent defense companies with more than $ 10 million in contracts from hiring senior defense personnel for two years after those officials leave government service. The lawmakers defined senior officials as those receiving no less than $ 68,700 a year and specifically mentioned the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, general counsel and the services' secretary and chief of staff. In all, there are 1,580 civilians and 1,073 general officers who fit the legislation's definition, the lawmakers said. The statistics were based on information from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manpower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a private group. The three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members complained that, according to fiscal 1987 data, the latest figures available, 39 percent of former senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials worked on the same contract for a defense company that they had handled while at the Pentagon. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reported that about 70 percent of former defense officials violate the law by failing to report their new jobs with defense contractors. `` The question before us today is whether the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will be asked to throw up their hands and resign themselves to having their chicken coops guarded by some very hungry foxes,'' <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> called the legislation a `` simple bill'' that for two years would prevent `` somebody in a high-ranking position from sitting at one side of the negotiating table and then jumping to the other side.'' Current law prevents former officials from working for a company on the same contract they supervised while in government service. The officials could work for the company on other matters. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and other <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials have complained that the revolving door laws have made it difficult to attract qualified people from the defense industry to work for the government. Asked whether the regulations are preventing the best and the brightest from serving the government, <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> said the country does n't need people `` cashing in on government service.'' `` Certain people will not do it and good riddance,'' she said. `` We do n't want them in government.'' <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> said the former officials would be prevented from working for two years at about 1,300 defense companies of the 40,000. They would not be restricted from working for universities and think tanks. <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> is co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on defense.

 Soviet veterans of the fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Wednesday shared their sorrows with Americans who are mourning friends and relatives killed in the Vietnam War. The 15 `` Afghantsi,'' as they are known in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, began their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit with a trip to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial, which memorializes those killed and missing in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s longest war Dressed like other tourists, the Soviets blended into the throngs of Americans solemnly looking at the 58,156 names etched into the low, black granite wall and the flowers, letters, flags and medals left at its base. The two wars _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> _ are often compared in terms of the trauma they caused the two superpowers and the alienation and other psychological problems faced by veterans. The Soviet visit is part of an attempt to gain insight into how American veterans coped with their postwar psychological problems. They also want to learn about developments in artificial limbs and other aids for the handicapped, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, president of the Center for Study of the Vietnam Generation. The memorial and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mourners `` have ignited our fires, made our pulses beat faster ... we have felt ourselves like those who fought in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpenko </PERSON>, a 27-year-old veteran with a burn-scarred face and forehead. <PERSON> Karpenko </PERSON>, wearing a <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> baseball cap given him by an American, said he was injured in the explosion of his armored car in a 1981 guerrilla ambush while he helped guard an Afghan army convoy from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Ghardez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Knerick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, who fought in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> from 1982-84, described as `` a spiritual experience'' his coversation through an interpreter with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Puller </PERSON>, a legless veteran of a 1968 ambush at <LOCATION> Danang </LOCATION>. The Soviet `` Afghantsi'' put up their own memorial and began their own rehabilitation programs, with the help of World War II vets, he said. Now they are `` waking up the government for social and medical rehabilitation,'' <PERSON> Knerick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Puller </PERSON>, 43, recalled that he and his late father, famed Marine Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> B. `` Chesty'' <PERSON> Puller </PERSON>, `` disagreed on everything politically,'' to which <PERSON> Knerick </PERSON> replied, `` that was understandable.'' The Soviets said they have organized the Union of Afghanistan Veterans under Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s liberalized policies. The Soviet veterans, accompanied by psychologists, were invited by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans who visited them last year on a survey of Soviet war rehabilitation problems. The visitors are staying in private homes. They will be shown veterans' hospitals and counseling centers and told how <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> veterans `` had to organize and fight the government to get justice, how we work with Viet veterans now in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, how we used the court system'' in such matters as compensation for victims of Agent Orange, said <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviets plan to take part in the city's weekend observance of Memorial Day, the national holiday honoring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> war dead. They then will visit homes in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>.; <LOCATION> Bainbridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 A mother's 21-month jail stay should end because further incarceration wo n't end a bitter child custody battle or persuade her to reveal where she has hidden her daughter, a city appeals court was told Wednesday. Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a prominent plastic surgeon, was sent to the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> on civil contempt charges in August 1987 after refusing to produce her daughter <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> for court-ordered visits with <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s ex-husband and the girl's father. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said she hid the girl because <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> had sexually abused her; <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> has denied those charges. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> has been in prison ever since, and the six-year-old <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>'s whereabouts are unknown. `` She will not trade her freedom for her daughter's safety,'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s attorney, told a three-judge <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> panel that was reviewing a lower court judge's decision to keep <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> behind bars. Civil contempt of court jailings are designed to coerce an inmate into providing information, property or persons the court seeks, but <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> argued that since <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> has not cooperated and has not been charged with a crime, her jailing violates her due process rights. `` Dr. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> is confined unconstitutionally because her incarceration will not serve a coercive function,'' <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said. `` There is no substantive likelihood that she will relent -LRB- and reveal her daughter's location -RRB- _ not today, not tomorrow, not ever.'' While in jail, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> has been forced to shut down her once-thriving plastic surgery practice, and <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said her debts now exceed $ 1.5 million. `` She has demonstrated her resolve,'' <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> argued. `` This is not Dr. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s word we're asking the court to rely on. These are hard facts here.'' The hearing came one day after Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., introduced a bill that would limit civil contempt of court jailings in the nation's capital to 18 months The bill would also apply the law retroactively to <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s case, which would lead to her freedom. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee plans to schedule additional hearings on the matter before voting on it. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, who attended Wednesday's appeals court ruling, said afterward that he was willing to sit down with <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> and negotiate a settlement that would lead both to <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s freedom and the safe return of his daughter. If the appeals court frees <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, there are no guarantees that he will see his daughter again, <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> said. `` Until we know my daughter is safe, the only tether we have to her is Dr. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s incarceration,'' said <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>. `` I do n't derive any pleasure from seeing her in jail, but I need to know where my little girl is. Appeals court rulings in such cases can take up to two months. None of the judges on the panel offered any indication when a ruling would be issued.

 Troops opened fire on ethnic Turks demonstrating in northeastern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> for more rights, and at least two protesters were killed, state media said Wednesday. Exile sources in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and a diplomat in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> indicated there were many more casualties in the violence last weekend, although they could not give figures. Turkish newspapers said as many as 25 people were killed in the clashes. Northeastern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> is home to most of the 900,000 ethnic Turks in the <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> country. The weekend disturbances were among the worst since a campaign in the early 1980s by Bulgarian authorities to get ethnic Turks to adopt Bulgarian-sounding names, restrict their Moslem religious rites and bar the Turkish language in public. The unrest in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> highlighted the recent rise in ethnic tensions throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. From the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to nonaligned communist <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, ethnic minorities have rebelled against discrimination and the denial of rights often enumerated in national constitutions. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that two people were shot and killed by security forces and a third died of heart failure during the clashes in the village of <LOCATION> Todor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ikonomovo </LOCATION>. Three other people, also believed to be ethnic Turks, were injured in the village 187 miles east of <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said. In addition to the <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikonomovo </PERSON>, riots also broke out in some areas of the regions of Razgrad and <LOCATION> Varna </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION>. The diplomat in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the demonstration in Razgrad involved between 4,000 and 5,000 people, and 200 arrests were made. Authorities moved in tanks and helicopters after the clashes in Razgrad, the diplomats said, and communications to the city were cut. It was not known if they had been restored by Wednesday. He said he also heard of clashes between ethnic Turks and security forces in <LOCATION> Dulovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kaolinovo </LOCATION> in the northeastern part of the country. In <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Inal </PERSON> <PERSON> Batu </PERSON> told reporters the government had formally asked <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> for information about the unrest. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> condemned the crackdown on ethnic Turks. `` We deplore <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s blatant use of force in attempting to silence the long-repressed ethnic Turkish minority,'' a statement said. `` We have repeatedly raised our objections in both bilateral and international fora to the Bulgarian treatment of its ethnic Turkish minority.'' <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> did not refer to ethnic Turks in its report because officially there is no Turkish minority in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. `` Extremist-minded individuals, some under the influence of alcohol, committed a gross violation of peace and tried to draw groups of the population into acts of lawless violence,'' it said. It blamed the disturbances on `` inaccurate information provided by some local authorities'' on recently eased travel laws, which allegedly created `` misunderstandings among certain strata of the population.'' The new laws, passed by the Bulgarian parliament this month, make it easier for the country's 8.9 million citizens to get a passport and travel abroad. This would also include ethnic Turks seeking to make trips to neighboring <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The report did not say exactly how the alleged `` misunderstandings'' of the travel laws gave rise to the unrest. Emighre sources in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said a protest hunger strike among ethnic Turks that started May 6 has spread to several parts of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and is estimated to involve up to 300 people at a time. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> ruled <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> for 500 years before 1863, and there is a long history of conflict. Periodic unrest has been reported since 1984 in ethnic Turkish areas, and reports of growing protest have circulated among diplomats in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> for at least a month.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's international debt strategy has cleared a key hurdle by winning endorsement from the board of directors of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> disclosed Wednesday. The approval was considered crucial to implementation of the plan because both the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, have key roles to play in the debt-reduction strategy, which was unveiled by Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> on March 10. Under the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan, Third World debtor nations could tap resources of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to use an incentive to encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of the $ 1.2 trillion in debt being carried by developing countries. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> agreement came at a closed meeting Tuesday of the 22 members of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>'s board of executive directors. `` In general terms, the agreement for the most part endorsed the proposals put forward by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan envisions both reduction of total debt and reduction of the interest burden countries must pay each year. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> endorsed both of these concepts. He predicted similar approval when the top executive body of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> takes up the proposal Tuesday. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said he hoped the agreement to go forward with the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan would help in upcoming negotiations between debtor countries and commercial banks, in particular in the current talks with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> told reporters that the precise sums could not be given on the amounts that would be available for debt relief as nobody knows how many countries will ask for help. Previously, the administration has used estimates that over the next three years the plan could wipe out about $ 70 billion of the $ 340 billion owed by 39 of the most heavily indebted countries. That estimate was based on an assumption that the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> would contribute together $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion to back the debt-reduction effort.

 A high-tech smuggling operation based in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> sought <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computers to bolster the Soviet air defense system after a West German pilot landed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Red Square on a lark, a federal official said Wednesday. The disclosure by <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s top agent in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, came as five people and two corporations were indicted by a federal grand jury in a smuggling case involving $ 1.8 million worth of sensitive computer equipment. The federal government based its case on information from a Dutch citizen caught working last year as an operative for the Belgian-based network, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. The informant, <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Haak </PERSON>, was told by others in the network dealing on behalf of Soviet bloc countries that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computers were needed `` to shore up their air defense after they found that it was ineffective and in disrepair. They discovered this when a West German pilot landed in Red Square,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said after the indictment was announced. Nineteen-year-old pilot <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> evaded Soviet air defenses as he flew a small <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> aircraft into Soviet air space, buzzed the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and landed before a startled crowd in Red Square on May 28, 1987. He was imprisoned in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for 14 months. His unhindered penetration of Soviet air space resulted in a shakeup of the Soviet military and, according to <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, secret orders for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computers that could be used to prevent a recurrence. Customs agents infiltrated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> end of the smuggling ring after <PERSON> Haak </PERSON> was lured to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and arrested, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. The indictment covers deals made with undercover Customs agents who replaced the smugglers, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. The indictment charges violation of the Export Administration Act, which limits the export of sensitive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> materials, and conspiracy to export two <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. VAX 8820 computer systems via <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, a routine channel for Soviet bloc procurements The indictment named <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Smylie </PERSON>, 39, and his wife, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and their <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetstein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and his <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conversion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Specialists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; and computer company employees <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blalock </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Parish </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The four Texans were taken into custody last week, and <PERSON> Wetstein </PERSON> is being sought in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. The name of the suspected Belgian ringleader has not been released. If convicted, the defendants face up to 15 years in federal prison and up to $ 6.5 million in fines. The companies face up to $ 6.8 million in fines. The computers listed in the indictment, described by <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> as top-of-the-line, general-purpose equipment, were seized last week in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, as they were being prepared for export. <PERSON> Haak </PERSON>, named as the intended buyer, recently was convicted in federal court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for trying to divert a similar system from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Federal authorities charged the network also made shipments to or through <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday narrowly defeated a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> attempt to blunt the key capital reform in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s savings and loan bailout plan. The amendment, which failed on a 17-17 vote, would have allowed some institutions to use administrative appeals to delay the imposition of tougher capital standards for up to 18 months. Eleven Republicans and six Democrats supported the weakening amedment, offered by Reps. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. Three Republicans and 14 Democrats voted The committee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, abstained. The vote was the latest in a series by both the Judiciary panel and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has attracted more Democratic than Republican support for preserving his proposed reforms. The banking committee adopted its version of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation three weeks ago. The full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will likely consider it early next month, along with alternatives to specific sections passed by other committees. The House bill and legislation passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last month then would have to be reconciled in a conference between the two chambers before a final product can be sent to the president's desk. `` We're very happy to see strong capital survive,'' said Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, one of the architects of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s S & amp; L plan. `` But we have no illusions. We'll have to fight it again and again and again It's like one of those cheap movies. The monster keeps coming back,'' he said. The key reform in the banking panel's bill would require S & amp; L owners to risk $ 3 of `` real money'' or `` tangible'' capital for every $ 100 they lend. Senate-passed legislation would require $ 1.50 in tangible capital for every $ 100 lent. Both versions would eliminate an accounting break known as `` supervisory goodwill.'' In the early 1980s, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators authorized some healthy S & amp; Ls to count goodwill as capital in exchange for assuming the losses of ailing institutions. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> argued that it is unfair to `` change the rules in the middle of the game'' and said that 152 institutions would have to be considered insolvent unless they are permitted to continue counting goodwill as capital. He would have required financial regulators to conduct hearings under the Administrative Procedures Act for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners who believed the government was reneging on an agreement by changing the rules for counting goodwill. `` My amendment says ... you get a chance at due process before we hold the funeral,'' he said. In other action, the Judiciary committee defeated on a voice vote an attempt by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, to halve the maximum proposed jail term for financial institution fraud from 20 years to 10 years and to eliminate sentencing guidelines calling for jail terms for first offenders.

 Two congressmen said Wednesday they would investigate <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> selection of an Italian gunmaker over <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> to make the military's chief handgun. The Army, for the second time in four years, selected <LOCATION> Beretta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Armi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, over <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Wesson of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ruger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Southport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, also was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The Army on Monday said sample weapons submitted for testing by <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ruger </PERSON> failed to meet minimum performance requirements and the <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M-9 </ORGANIZATION> tested significantly better. `` I can not say at this time that the tests were rigged, but my hunting dog nose tells me that something might be amiss here,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass. `` I will not give up until I am certain <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> is given a fair shake.'' Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mass </LOCATION>, said he and <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> `` will scrutinize every aspect of this competition. If there is a hint of any irregularity, we'll insist on a full explanation and appropriate corrective action.'' `` We have not seen the test results yet, but I will insist upon a full accounting by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The latest competition was ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> and former Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, complained that <PERSON> Beretta </PERSON> was unfairly awarded a contract in 1985 to build its M-9 pistol as the replacement for the military's venerable Colt .45. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> agreed with the lawmakers that <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wesson </PERSON> was improperly shut out of the final bidding process for the original $ 75 million contract to build 315,000 pistols. The new contract competition is worth $ 9.9 million to build 56,705 guns, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> on two separate occasions found against the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> said. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> agreed that <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> has previously been treated unfairly in technical disqualifications, and here we are again. You can rest assured that I will look into every aspect of this evaluation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, in its statement Monday, did not specify the problems with the <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> or Sturm Ruger guns. Army officials said they would brief the companies Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Md. -RRB- Proving Ground. The contract award comes in the wake of a series of problems with the 140,000 Beretta pistols already delivered. Beretta, which opeates a plant in <LOCATION> Accokeek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where the guns are assembled, agreed last summer to suspend deliveries while it corrected a problem that led to a dangerous cracking of the gun's chamber slide Deliveries resumed earlier this month, according to Beretta officials. The Army ordered reduced usage of the guns after a fifth accident in which a chamber slide cracked, sending fragments toward the shooter's chest. In March, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said its SEAL commando forces would not switch to the Beretta 9mm because of the slide failures.

 Southern leaders said Wednesday their new plan to reduce the region's high rate of teen-age pregencies will go beyond urging boys and girls to abstain from sex. `` To prevent adoloscent pregenancies in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, you have to do a lot more than just educate adolescents about the dangers of pregnancies,'' <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said. `` You've got to start with early childhood education; you've got to work on things such as life goals, self esteem, hope for the future,'' he said. `` You've got to involve the community, you've got to involve the parents, you've got to involve the boys as well as the girls. <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> co-chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adolescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pregnancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION>, created a year ago by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. The report proposes a detailed blueprint for government, business, church and civic leaders. `` Adolescents are more likely to get pregnant if they do n't have high expectations, do n't think they will finish their education, do n't think there's a good job waiting, do n't think their life holds a lot for them,'' <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said. The panel proposed teaching life skills at the earliest possible age through state and federal funding of early childhood education programs; family curricula starting in kindergarten; corporate incentives to keep kids in school; expanded public and private efforts to improve jobs; help for adults who want to be better parents; and better health care for young people. The report said 47 percent of the 178,000 births to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> girls under age 17 in 1985 occurred in 17 Southern states, even though only 37 percent of girls under 17 live in the region. Among girls under 17 with second or higher order births that year, 49 percent were in the South. New statistics gathered for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> on Infant Mortality show that <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> led the region in 1987 with 29.62 pregnancies for every 1,000 girls between the ages of 10 and 17. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> was second, with an adolescent pregnancy rate of 29.42, followed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> at 27.76, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> at 26.92, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> at 26.02, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> at 25.32, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> at 25.27, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> at 25.18, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> at 25.41 and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> at 21.20. In six of those 10 states, the adolescent pregnancy rate was higher in 1987 then in 1986, indicating that the decade-long trend of slowly declining adolescent pregnancy rates in the South may be reversing.

<HEAD>Governor's Signing Makes California Gun Law First In Nation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> enacted the nation's first statewide restrictions on the possession or sale of assault weapons Wednesday when Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> signed two bills sparked by a schoolyard massacre. The bills ban the sale of 55 semiautomatic assault rifles, pistols and shotguns beginning Jan. 1. But they allow people who currently own those weapons lawfully to keep them if they register with the state. The legislation was prompted by a Jan. 17 attack at a Stockton elementary school in which a deranged man with an AK-47 assault rifle killed five children and wounded 30 other people before taking his own life. The attack prompted similar bills in several states, including <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s are the first to be passed and signed into law The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> bill failed in committee Wednesday, and lawmakers there say it is unlikely any gun control legislation will be adopted this year. Several cities, including <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, have enacted local restrictions. `` These bills are not going to bring back to life the five beautiful children who were killed on the schoolyard in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said during a Capitol bill-signing ceremony. `` I hope they will help our courageous law enforcement community in fighting violent crime.'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, a Republican who is a longtime foe of gun control measures, said he would also sign legislation requiring a 15-day waiting period for all gun sales, but stressed that he still opposes any further gun control. `` This legislation only bans specified weapons that are not needed by individuals for their self-protection or recreation purposes. They can still go hunting, they can still go target shooting with many other guns,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said. Despite those assurances, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s signing of the two bills, written by two <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Democrats, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberti </PERSON> and Assemblyman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Roos </PERSON>, sparked immediate recall threats. A lone picket stood in front of the Capitol with a sign saying `` Impeach Anti-Gun Traitors'' during the bill signing, and a gun-owners group announced a recall drive against <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. The governor said he was n't surprised or worried about the recall threats. <PERSON> Roberti </PERSON> said he hoped <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s restrictions will `` be a leadership action -LRB- showing -RRB- what can be accomplished in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' `` I pledge this is just a beginning,'' said <PERSON> Roos </PERSON>. `` Today clearly shows <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s watershed position for the country when it comes to crime control and control of violent weapons that people unfortunately have had too easy access to.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has sent a new letter to the West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on the short-range missile dispute in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser said Wednesday that `` time is running out'' for resolving the rift in the alliance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent the letter to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> late Tuesday evening and the German leader intends to respond to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal `` as soon as possible,'' a diplomatic source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. Officials on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> have been scrambling to heal the rift in advance of a summit meeting of leaders of the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, next week. The disagreement may continue to fester until the meeting, which is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first as the leader of the Western alliance and is designed to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The leaders will gather amid a series of arms control proposals by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that have enticed many in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to question the need for updating <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear stockpile. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, commented to reporters as the president delivered the commencement address at the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. Asked if there had been progress in negotiations with the West Germans, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> responded, `` Not measureably.'' Queried whether that meant that the president would travel to the summit without a solution, he said, `` Time is running out.'' The national security adviser added that both sides were `` still talking'' and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not given up on finding a way out of the problem. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> confirmed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had responded to the West Germans, but she refused to give any details of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reply. `` We're not negotiating in public; I just ca n't get into the specifics,'' she said. She repeated Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s expression that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` hopeful'' that a compromise can be reached prior to the summit meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. The controversy stems from a push by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to update aging Lance surface-to-surface nuclear missiles, most of which are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Public opinion in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has turned against such a move, and <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has pressed for an early round of U.S.-Soviet talks on the missile, in part as a means of shoring up his domestic political position. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> last week that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepted the idea of such negotiations in principle, but has opposed opening any such talks until <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces are reduced. The Americans have also demanded that the Germans oppose the total elimination of the weapons. If the short-range Lances were modernized, their range would be tripled to just below 300 miles. All <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles with ranges between 300 and 3,000 miles were banned under a 1987 treaty. The U.S.-built Lances now can hit targets from about 75 miles away.

<HEAD>Italian Printer Honored for Saving Jews from Holocaust</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A nervous, white-haired printer from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was honored Wednesday for having the courage to stand up to the Nazi Holocaust and save thousands of Jews from death by printing false documents for them. <PERSON> Trento </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizi </PERSON> and his town of <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION> are examples of what ordinary people can do in the face of tyranny, said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Graphic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, in a wreath-laying ceremony at the city's Holocaust Memorial. The association invited Brizi to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to receive its third annual Freedom of the Press Award. The award, for demonstrating commitment to a free and uncensored press and to the basic human rights of all people, has gone to The Wall Street Journal and <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> newspapers in the past. With <PERSON> Brizi </PERSON>, 80, came the Rev. <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunacci </PERSON> and Mayor <PERSON> Edo </PERSON> <PERSON> Romoli </PERSON>, representing the clergy and townspeople of <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION> became an underground haven in 1943 as the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> were intensifying their campaign to round up Jews in territories they controlled. <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION>, the centuries-old home of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION>, had no Jewish population of its own but became a haven for the hunted people. At one point, according to <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON>, nearly half the people of <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION> were hiding Jews sought for the concentration camps. <PERSON> Brizi </PERSON>, wounded in the war, came home to help his father, <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON>, in the family print shop. The Rev. <PERSON> Ruffino </PERSON> <PERSON> Niccaci </PERSON>, an underground leader, asked them to print false identity papers and transit visas that would allow those in hiding to escape to safe lands. The father and son team used names from the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> telephone book and designed fake city seals as they thought they might look. They counterfeited seals of cities under Allied control, making it difficult for the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> to check them. They ran their printing shop by day and worked on the documents by night, eventually printing documents for more than 5,000 Jewish and political refugees. No one was ever captured with their false documents, according to the printers' association. <PERSON> Brunacci </PERSON> helped distribute the fake papers, hiding them inside the frame of his bicycle. The <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION> underground eventually involved almost 500 priests, half the townspeople and the cloistered nuns of the Convent of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quirico </LOCATION>. The nuns broke a 700-year-old tradition of not allowing men inside the convent to hide Jewish refugees. `` Eighty to 85 percent of the Italian Jews survived because this kind of thing was happening all over <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON> said. `` In the rest of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, 80 percent of the Jews were killed.'' <PERSON> Brunacci </PERSON> and Rabbi <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausen </PERSON> placed the floral wreath bearing the message `` <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION> Remembers,'' at the foot of the 20-foot statue of twisted, intertwined arms and legs. <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizi </PERSON> died in 1969, his deeds never officially recognized. <PERSON> Trento </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizi </PERSON>, who still operates the family business, accepted a plaque but did n't speak at the morning ceremony. `` I was nervous when I got up this morning, but I'm all right, now,'' he said through an interpreter as television cameras bustled around him and city traffic roared by. He said he clearly remembers working in the night, hiding what he and his father were doing from the Nazi occupiers. `` At that time, none of us was really sure how it would all come out,'' he said. Why did he and the people of <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION> take such a great risk to save the Jews? `` We felt we had to do something,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Ideology Chief Speaks About Multiparty System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s top ideologist, was quoted Wednesday as saying he saw no contradiction between a multiparty system and a communist state, but that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is not ready for such a system. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, secretary for ideology in the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> it was necessary `` to maintain the force for integration that the -LRB- Communist -RRB- party represents in the present state of development, in the extreme complexity and diversity of perestroika.'' Perestroika, the Russian word for restructuring, has been the hallmark of the rule of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> was quoted as saying that `` efforts to weaken'' the party `` by putting other political forces and organizations up against it'' were aimed at `` blocking perestroika.'' Asked why Soviet television did not at first report on the massive demonstrations in Tiananmen Square during <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said the Soviets did not want to give the impression they were `` trying to influence internal events in the host country.'' On the process of `` diversification'' underway in such East bloc nations as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> was quoted as saying that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> approved of what was taking place and was encouraging the changes. `` We consider it irreversible,'' he was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> also said he believed in the market as a factor in the economy and that socialist states should not reject lessons learned from capitalism just because it was another system. He refused to discuss rivalries within the ruling Politburo, saying only that `` lively discussions'' took place. He denied there were different factions within the Politburo.

 A teen-ager who says she had sex with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> testified Wednesday that the congressman paid her $ 40 and gave her a birthday gift after going to bed with him last year. <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> knew she was not 19, as she had professed to be. She was 16 at the time. `` When I told him that I was 19, he looked and sort of laughed and said, ` No, not really,''' Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> testified on the third day of <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' trial. The 58-year-old Republican, who is divorced, is charged with contributing to the unruliness or delinquency of a minor, stemming from the alleged meeting at his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment last November. If convicted of the misdemeanor, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> could be sentenced to 180 days in jail and fined $ 1,000. He appeared agitated when Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> described in graphic detail a sexual encounter that she said she had with <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>. At one point, he clenched both fists and hit his knees. He repeatedly shook his head and scowled. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said she first met <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and did not see him again until the night of Nov. 6, 1988, when she and a friend, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, visited him at Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>'s suggestion. Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> was 19. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> greeted the two at the door wearing boxer shorts, and gave Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> a $ 20 bill to pay their cab driver, Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said. She said <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> recognized her but not Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said took them to a downstairs guest room. `` He told us to get undressed and put on ... two black robes,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said. She asked him why they could not wear two white robes she saw in the room. `` He said those were for white people ... other kind of people,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> are black. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> is white. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> testified that she and Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> got into bed with <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>. `` He started talking nasty,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> then sent Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> out of the room, Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said. She testified that she then performed oral sex on <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> and had intercourse with him twice. She said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> gave her two $ 20 bills and paid Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> $ 30. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> also gave her a glass of brandy and two gifts _ a pink lace fan and a silver pillbox _ and gave Ms. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> a bottle of perfume and a diamond pendant. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> testified later in the day that she went to <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' apartment to talk to him about how she felt about him in 1985, when she first met the congressman A court order has prevented either side from examining what happened in 1985 at length. Testimony has only included allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> gave her alcohol at that time. She said that `` when I got to the door -LRB- and made -RRB- eye contact, I felt the same feeling I had inside for him from the first time I was over there. It was like, should I say love and hate?'' Earlier Wednesday, defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyack </PERSON> attacked the testimony of the girl's mother, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, and tried to depict her as continually unemployed and desperate for notoriety and money. WSYX-TV broadcast on Feb. 1 a secretly recorded videotape that apparently shows <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> offering Mrs. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> a government job after she asked him why he was `` messing around'' with her daughter. The Nov. 11, 1988, meeting at a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> restaurant was recorded by the station. <ORGANIZATION> WSYX </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who arranged the videotaping of the meeting, testified Wednesday he never heard Mrs. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> ask <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> for money, but said he heard <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> offer to help her find a job after she explained that her daughter was underage.

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death row inmates expressed worry Wednesday after a fellow prisoner was executed for a 1981 abduction, rape and slaying because his case sailed through appeals courts without even a temporary stay. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, a 40-year-old electrician from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m. Wednesday, seven minutes after a lethal mixture of drugs was injected into his arms. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> lost a final appeal late Tuesday when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> voted 5-4 to deny a stay without further comment. The appeal was <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>'s first to reach the high court and it has been routine for initial appeals to merit at least one reprieve. `` The significance of this is the courts very clearly are indicating impatience with dilatory tactics within the process and they intend to expedite the process,'' said state Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON>, who witnessed the execution and predicted the pace of executions in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> would accelerate. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>'s execution was the 31st in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the 110th in the nation since the 1976 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allowing states to resume use of the death penalty. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has had the most executions, followed by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with 21 and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> with 18. `` We anticipate the length between the time of conviction and execution will grow shorter,'' <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said. `` Legitimate issues -LRB- for appeals -RRB- are getting fewer and fewer.'' `` Things never look good for death row inmates,'' condemned prisoner <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Bower </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Things look especially poor now. We're running out of generic issues to bring to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` The fact he could not -LRB- get a stay -RRB- changes the seriousness of everyone,'' added <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON>, another inmate. `` They sure zipped it through fast,'' said prisoner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON>. `` It's a bad precedent.'' <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> was convicted in the murder of <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 18, who was abducted by <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> and two other men from her car after it broke down on a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> freeway as she was returning home from a New Year's Eve party. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, who had insisted he was in another room when the woman was slain, made no final statement. He smiled briefly to four friends he invited to the execution. He coughed and his chest heaved five times as the drugs began to take effect, then uttered two long, low groans before he stopped breathing.

<HEAD>French Doctors Partially Withdraw Claim About Toxic Gas in Soviet

<TEXT>
 A French humanitarian group said Wednesday it was withdrawing part of its claim about the use of toxic gas during street protests in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> last month in which 19 people were killed. A statement issued Tuesday by Medecins sans Frontiers -LRB- Doctors Without Borders -RRB- said autopsies on 16 victims identified <PERSON> Chloropicrine </PERSON> as one of the gases. On Wednesday, the organization said its doctors were denied full access to Soviet autopsy reports, but laboratory analysis of the substance allegedly used in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> to disperse 10,000 protesters April 9 revealed <PERSON> Chloropicrine </PERSON>. `` Chrloropicrine is a highly toxic substance used widely during World War I in combat,'' Dr. <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemery </PERSON>, a Belgian toxicoligist, told reporters in a telephone connection with a news conference at the group's <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> headquarters. `` It is highly probable that it was used, but until we have the results of a biological analysis performed on an organ of a victim it is impossible to say with complete certitude,'' he said. Doctors Without Borders said a <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> doctor invited Dr. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumack </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, to analyze a small container of gas the Georgian said had been used on the protesters. The four-member French team worked with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> doctors and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chloropicrine </PERSON> was approved in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for use as a tear gas until 1981, when it was reclassified as a `` suffocant'' or asphyxiating gas for combat use, the French organization said. Soviet authorities have denied toxic gas was used to disperse the protesters. Members of the French team said they learned through Soviet doctors that two victims showed no signs of external physical trauma and death probably was due to inhaling gases, but both victims had burned lungs and the doctors concluded ordinary tear gas would not cause such damage. The doctors said they examined and questioned hundreds of witnesses and victims. They said many people had been admitted to hospitals with symptoms common to trauma victims. `` Children came staggering in, unable to walk straight, complaining about intense fatigue, nauseau, dizziness, irritability, anxiety, depression and indigestion,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Barel </PERSON>, a lung and heart specialist. `` Waves of people'' began pouring into doctors' offices and hospitals on May 17, he said, which was 40 days after the event. <PERSON> Barel </PERSON> said not all of them had been gassed. `` That corresponds to the end of the period of mourning for -LRB- Russian -RRB- Orthodox,'' he said. `` They ... showed some of the same symptoms of the people who had been in the streets on April 9.'' Hundreds of other people were admitted to hospitals long after the clash, believing they were suffering from secondary effects of the toxic gas, but <PERSON> Barel </PERSON> said they showed no evidence of nerve damage.

<TEXT>
 Ten years ago Thursday, 6-year-old <PERSON> Etan </PERSON> <PERSON> Patz </PERSON>, walking alone for the first time to his school bus, vanished from the streets of lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Police and his parents still get reports of purported sightings of him. But despite extensive publicity, a $ 25,000 reward and photographs of the boy plastered all over the city, <PERSON> Etan </PERSON> has not been found. The case, No. 8367, is still open, and there have been thousands of leads, so many of them credible that investigators have been to every state and some foreign countries. But `` the odds are very, very much against <PERSON> Etan </PERSON> being alive,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Missing Persons Squad. `` It has never happened in the history of this department that a person missing that long has been found alive,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who was one of the many officers who canvassed the <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> neighborhood where <PERSON> Etan </PERSON> vanished. Most children abducted by strangers, which is what the police believe happened to <PERSON> Etan </PERSON>, are killed `` right away,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Etan </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Patz </PERSON>, whose faces were almost as familiar around the city as their missing son's because of their willingness to be interviewed, said Wednesday they had decided not to talk with reporters about the anniversary. The thousands of interviews the couple had granted `` have not been helpful and it's intrusive, it cuts into our privacy,'' <PERSON> Patz </PERSON> said. The Patzes have two other children, <PERSON> Shira </PERSON>, now 18, and <PERSON> Ari </PERSON>, 12. <PERSON> Patz </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he does n't agree with the police. `` I think he's still alive, but there's not much evidence to support that, it's an article of faith,'' he said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said his squad still receives `` two to three sightings a week on <PERSON> Etan </PERSON>,'' from all over the country. The lieutenant predicted his squad will get more calls because of news stories about the anniversary. The <PERSON> Patz </PERSON> family also receives calls from cranks and psychics about their son. `` There's a hard core out there,'' <PERSON> Patz </PERSON> sighed. `` We live with it every day, this is just a worse week than others,'' he added. The parents speak weekly with Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, who handles the case, police said. Interest in the case still remains strong. `` It has captured the public's imagination like no other case,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. When asked why, he shook his head. `` If I could answer that, I think I could solve the case,'' he said.

 Federal programs allowing livestock grazing and hay cutting on land taken out of production under this year's crop acreage programs have been expanded in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> announced Wednesday `` I'm encouraged by the rain that has fallen in the Midwestern and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> growing areas in the past week,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` In many places the drought has broken. However, the additional relief actions taken today will help reduce livestock sell-offs in areas where haying and grazing conditions are still not adequate.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he will allow statewide emergency haying and grazing of cropland normally held out of production under 1989 commodity programs in states where 75 percent of the counties have been designated as already eligible for haying and grazing. States which meet that requirement are <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, he said. Other states will be added when they meet the 75 percent criterion. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also relaxed the department's forage sales policy so producers in eligible counties can sell forage from the conservation land at full market prices instead of at levels only to recover harvest costs, which is the current policy. `` Rain is predicted for much of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> areas in the next several days, which could prove to be extremely beneficial for those growing areas,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> drought task force will continue to monitor ... situations on a daily basis and forward additional recommendations to me if and when the situation warrants it.'' In his latest actions, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> stopped short of approving requests from some farm leaders who wanted him to open up for haying and grazing millions of acres taken from production under the 10-year Conservation Program. Dozens of states were made eligible to cut hay from <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> land in last year's drought, but none has been approved for 1989. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s press secretary, said: `` We have not ruled out opening up CRP. It's just at this point we think that it is prudent to watch that very carefully.'' Asked if some additional states might be near the 75 percent level required for statewide haying and grazing approval on idled program land, <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> would be the closest, with around 50 percent or so of the counties currently eligible.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday rebuked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for claiming it has primary authority over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> until the country gains full independence in November. In a private briefing with the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> stressed that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has ultimate authority over military affairs in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, diplomats who attended the meeting said on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief drew a clear line between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s responsibility for local law enforcement and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s authority over any potential call-up of the territorial militia or the South African army, they In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, South African Foreign Minster R.F. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said that responsibility for the administration of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> through independence is the primary task of the South African-appointed administrator-general. That includes responsibility for maintaining law and order in the territory, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said in his letter, dated May 19. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to a U.N.-mediated independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> that began April 1 and is to culminate in elections Nov. 1. But the process was interrupted the day it began when hundreds of armed guerrillas from the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> crossed into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. In subsequent fighting, 316 guerrillas and 27 South African security force members were killed. Both said the administrator-general, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, `` has the right to use such measures and means as he would deem appropriate to counter activities of an aggressive, violent or intimidatory nature emanating from whatever quarter.'' But African diplomats said they were concerned <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> would feel free to recall the army to handle any new incursions by <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, the main rebel group in the territory. Under accords signed in December by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> pledged to cooperate with the plan to make <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> an independent black majority-ruled nation.

<HEAD>Joint Commission Reports on Hitler-Stalin Pact</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A joint panel on sensitive areas in Polish-Soviet history says the Soviet foreign minister's comments after <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was invaded in 1939 were `` contradictory to international law and offensive to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' A report called `` Origins and Beginning of World War II'' was published Wednesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION>, which said it appeared simultaneously in Pravda, the Soviet party newspaper. It includes a reference to the Aug. 23, 1939, Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact and the secret protocol attached to it defining how the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and Soviets would divide <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. World War II began with the German invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> Sept. 1, 1939, the day after the Supreme Soviet ratified the agreement. Soviet soldiers invaded from the east Sept. 17. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Molotov </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> Soviet a month later that the two armies had wiped out `` this grotesque product of the Treaty of <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION>,'' the report said. Molotov's statement was `` contradictory to international law and offensive to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' the report declared. `` The present Soviet leadership and the scientific community of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> distance themselves decisively from it.'' Western historians learned of the secret protocol from captured Nazi documents. The report published Wednesday said the original could not be found in Soviet or other archives. It also said a Soviet goverment statement handed to the <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> ambassador Sept. 17, 1939, declaring the Polish state to be no longer in existence was `` discrepant with the norms of international law.'' That statement said Soviet forces entered <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> only to protect the inhabitants of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. `` The course of events connected with the movement of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in September 1939 to the west requires more detailed historical studies,'' the joint report said. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziembinski </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic journalist and historian, said the report only complicates the process of resolving historical discrepancies. `` This does not satisfy the Polish nation in any case and certainly does not satisfy Polish historians. This document will receive my reply, although I do n't know how it will be with the censorship,'' said <PERSON> Ziembinski </PERSON>, who has written extensively on Polish-Soviet relations in World War II. Two years ago, authorities banned an article by <PERSON> Ziembinski </PERSON> on Nazi-Soviet cooperation in partitioning <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. For Poles, the sorest points of mutual history are the murder of more than 4,000 Polish officers in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> and the internment of at least 10,000 more in Soviet prison camps. Official Polish and Soviet histories say the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> killed the officers in 1941, but many Poles and Western historians believe the Soviets killed them in 1940. The commission, established two years ago, has yet to deliver its findings on the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre, but a Soviet popular magazine recently raised the possibility that the Soviets were responsible.

<HEAD>Governor Signs Future Ban on Vehicles Cooled By CFCs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> on Wednesday became the first state to ban vehicles that use ozone-depleting chemicals in their air conditioning. `` Americans are ready to take tough actions to protect our fragile environment, even if it requires changing our own behavior or giving up certain luxuries,'' Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> said in signing the legislation into law. `` By enacting this important legislation, Vermonters are demonstrating that we are willing to act immediately to protect the stratospheric ozone layer,'' she said. The ban covers the sale or registration of 1993 models that use chlorofluorocarbons, a class of chemical blamed for destroying the ozone layer that protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. Car air conditioning systems are the single largest source of ozone depletion from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The legislation takes other, more immediate steps to reduce <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> emissions: _ Starting in 1991, equipment used to service air conditioners in vehicles must recycle the <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> coolant, rather than release it into the atmosphere. _ As of March 1, 1990, <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> recycling equipment must be used to service building air conditioners and large refrigeration units if such equipment is `` portable and suitable for those purposes.'' _ The sale of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> recharge kits will be prohibited so that consumers can not circumvent the law's recycling requirements by servicing their own cars' air conditioning systems. _ The sale of CFC-based fire extinguishers, consumer cleaning sprays and CFC-propelled party streamers and horns is also prohibited. Despite years of research into a replacement coolant, the nation's Big Three automakers have said they doubt they can meet the 1993 deadline. `` There is no way any manufacturer will be able to modify its entire car line for <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> in essentially three years,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsweig </PERSON> said earlier this month.

 Five high school students were charged Wednesday with sexually assaulting a 17-year-old mentally retarded girl while eight other students watched, authorities said. Two of those arrested were charged as juveniles, and <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said additional arrests were possible. `` We are satisfied that this was a non-consensual sexual assault by these five males against this young woman,'' <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` She did n't understand the nature and quality of her actions.'' <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said the hour-long assault took place March 1 after the students met the girl in a <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> park and brought her to the nearby home of two of those charged, 18-year-old twins <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherzer </PERSON>, whose parents were away. The girl was assaulted with a small baseball bat and a broomstick in the <PERSON> Scherzer </PERSON> basement, <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said.

 Soldiers reported they were fired at Wednesday in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, and five Palestinians were sentenced to prison for their roles in a stone-throwing riot in which a Jewish guard accidentally killed an Israeli teen-ager. The shooting attack was the second reported against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security forces in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> in two days. No one was hurt in either incident. The attacks have fueled concern over Palestinian threats to step up violence against Israeli targets by using guns. A police van was hit in Monday's shooting. Soldiers on Wednesday carried out two in a series of more than 30 pre-dawn raids on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> villages this week, in which dozens of suspected <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists have been arrested. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> accused Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of harming the chances of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s peace plan and breaking the practice of not speaking publicly about U.S.-Israeli disagreements. In a <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> military court, five Palestinians were convicted and jailed in connection with the death of 15-year-old <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>. The death caused a furor in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last year because of the conflicting explanations of what happened. Jewish settlers claimed the girl was stoned to death or shot by Palestinians who attacked her and fellow settlers while they were on a hike in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. But the army later said she was shot accidentally by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> guard who was hit by a stone during the April 6, 1988 rioting in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> village. In court, the five defendants confessed to crimes in the incident, in which the Israelis shot and killed two Palestinians. Haled <PERSON> Hassin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Benishams </PERSON>, 19, was sentenced to four years' jail for forcing the hikers into a violent situation and attempting to stab the guard His companions were sentenced to terms of between 18 months and two years for throwing stones and threatening the hikers. In <LOCATION> El-Azariya </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, two settlers from nearby Maaleh Adumim were slightly injured late Wednesday night when their car came under an Arab stone-throwing attack. Hundreds of angry settlers demonstrated after the attack, the second in the area in four days. They tried to stage a revenge raid on El-Azariya but were blocked by troops, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said. A firebomb was thrown at a settler's car as it passed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Biddya </LOCATION>, 16 miles east of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. No one was injured, but the car was totally gutted by the flames, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. The army on Wednesday asked for an additional $ 233 million to put down the 17-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. It is the same amount that was cut when the military's $ 5.89 billion allotment was approved in February. In the latest army offensive, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said, troops Wednesday deported to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> six women and 10 children because the women overstayed permits allowing them to visit their Palestinian husbands. They were discovered in a raid at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amari </LOCATION> refugee camp. The army confirmed several people were expelled to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, an aid worker with Save the Children, was detained for three hours because he lives near the camp. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 35, said he saw several of 300 men detained in a schoolyard kicked and slapped, and heard screams from a bus after soldiers took three Palestinian refugees into the vehicle. The army said soldiers `` had to use some force'' when one detainee tried to grab a soldier's gun. Elsewhere in the territories, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded 13 people in clashes with stone-throwing Palestinians, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials said. Since the start of the revolt, 497 Palestinians and 22 Israelis have been killed. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> returned home Wednesday from a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to promote an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace plan aimed at ending the uprising. He told reporters he was concerned about <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s statement Monday urging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stop building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and to forget about annexing them. `` Mr. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s speech may make it more difficult ... to get European support for the plan,'' said <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. `` The things that were expressed publicly were harmful to the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The plan calls for electing Palestinians to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on self-rule in the territories, with talks in three years on the final status of the occupied lands. Palestinians oppose the plan because it does not offer independence or Israeli withdrawal.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday to pump an extra $ 822 million into federal efforts this year against illegal drugs, but decided not to increase anti-drug spending even more by taking money out of the Star Wars research budget. On a party-line 227-197 vote in which the chamber's majority Democrats prevailed, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> finally passed a $ 3.7 billion domestic spending measure for fiscal 1989 that included $ 822 million for anti-drug efforts. The legislation was a pared-down version of a $ 4.7 billion bill the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> refused to pass a month ago. But on a 213-205 vote, lawmakers rejected a measure that would have transferred to next year's drug programs any 1990 spending for Star Wars missile defense research above this year's $ 3.7 billion. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has sought nearly $ 900 million more for Star Wars in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. On a 409-0 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> then reiterated its support for a $ 1.2 billion measure for hard-pressed veterans programs, a bill that has bounced back and forth between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' two chambers because of a dispute between them over pet projects. The vote sent the legislation back to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which has approved a smaller version. The Democratic effort to bolster anti-drug initiatives was opposed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and put Republicans in the politically embarrassing position of having to vote against higher drug spending. House Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., called the two measures containing the drug funds `` a two-headed malodorous swamp animal. Nonetheless, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers argued the extra money for drug programs could wait until next year and would add even more red ink to the federal deficit. They also insisted that spending for anti-missile research should not be whittled down. `` Nobody's opposed to putting more money for drugs,'' said <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations Committee. `` What we are opposed to is the irresponsible way we're doing it.'' But Democrats argued that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should provide money for the Anti-Drug Abuse Act enacted last year and finance a struggle against drug traffickers that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emphasized during his campaign last year. `` Let's put our resources behind this war,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. The domestic spending bill contained $ 822 million for new prisons, extra law officers and other anti-drug initiatives. It included $ 893 million for the Guaranteed Student Loan program for college students, $ 423 million for state-run foster care programs, $ 342 million for the costs of battling last year's Western forest fire, and money for other programs. It also contains a provision that would grant the <ORGANIZATION> Latrobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> a temporary exemption from a federal law that requires alcoholic beverage containers to carry health warnings. <LOCATION> Latrobe </LOCATION> had complained that the painted labels on the beer it brews, <LOCATION> Rolling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, would be too expensive to alter. The measure was sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, D-Pa., whose district includes <LOCATION> Latrobe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. On April 26, a $ 4.7 billion version of the measure failed to gain <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval after lawmakers voted down a plan by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders to pay for the bill by cutting domestic and defense programs by 0.57 The separate measure to transfer spending from Star Wars to federal drug initiatives was sponsored by a trio of Democratic liberals: <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. It would freeze 1990 Star Wars spending at the 1989 level of $ 3.7 billion, and transfer the amount by which that program was to grow _ $ 862 million _ to next year's drug efforts. Last Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> took the $ 1.2 billion for veterans out of the domestic spending bill after Republicans, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and veterans groups complained that disputes over other portions of the legislation were bogging down the veterans funds. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> then passed the separate $ 1.2 billion veterans bill, which provides money for health care, a cost-of-living benefits increase and other programs run by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. Several hours later, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a different version of the bill, providing only enough money for veterans initiatives through June 15, or about $ 75 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> then left on its Memorial Day recess, which lasts until May 31. Senators argued that by saving most of the needed veterans money for a later bill, they could attach to that measure spending for programs they favor. Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> singled out $ 6.6 million needed this year for a program that subsidizes airlines serving remote Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> objected to this Wednesday, claiming that veterans would suffer so the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could win approval for programs it favors. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wo n't release the veterans as hostages,'' <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> said. The $ 1.2 billion for veterans was also included in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s larger domestic spending bill House members argued that by putting the money in both measures, it enhanced their bargaining position for upcoming negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on the legislation.

<TEXT>
 A joint panel on sensitive areas in Polish-Soviet history says the Soviet foreign minister's comments after <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was invaded in 1939 were `` contradictory to international law and offensive to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' A report called `` Origins and Beginning of World War II'' was published Wednesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION>, which said it appeared simultaneously in Pravda, the Soviet party newspaper. It includes a reference to the Aug. 23, 1939, Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact and the secret protocol attached to it defining how the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and Soviets would divide <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. World War II began with the German invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> Sept. 1, 1939, the day after the Supreme Soviet ratified the agreement. Soviet soldiers invaded from the east Sept. 17. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Molotov </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> Soviet a month later that the two armies had wiped out `` this grotesque product of the Treaty of <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION>,'' the report said. Molotov's statement was `` contradictory to international law and offensive to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' the report declared. `` The present Soviet leadership and the scientific community of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> distance themselves decisively from it.'' Western historians learned of the secret protocol from captured Nazi documents. The report published Wednesday said the original could not be found in Soviet or other archives. It also said a Soviet goverment statement handed to the <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> ambassador Sept. 17, 1939, declaring the Polish state to be no longer in existence was `` discrepant with the norms of international law.'' That statement said Soviet forces entered <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> only to protect the inhabitants of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. `` The course of events connected with the movement of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in September 1939 to the west requires more detailed historical studies,'' the joint report said. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziembinski </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic journalist and historian, said the report only complicates the process of resolving historical discrepancies. `` This does not satisfy the Polish nation in any case and certainly does not satisfy Polish historians. This document will receive my reply, although I do n't know how it will be with the censorship,'' said <PERSON> Ziembinski </PERSON>, who has written extensively on Polish-Soviet relations in World War II. Two years ago, authorities banned an article by <PERSON> Ziembinski </PERSON> on Nazi-Soviet cooperation in partitioning <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. For Poles, the sorest points of mutual history are the murder of more than 4,000 Polish officers in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> and the internment of at least 10,000 more in Soviet prison camps. Official Polish and Soviet histories say the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> killed the officers in 1941, but many Poles and Western historians believe the Soviets killed them in 1940. The commission, established two years ago, has yet to deliver its findings on the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre, but a Soviet popular magazine recently raised the possibility that the Soviets were responsible.

 Mauritanian troops are gathering on the border with <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, and the African neighbors may go to war, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>'s interior minister said Wednesday <PERSON> Djibrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ould </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallahi </PERSON> said in an interview on the French television network Antenne 2 that <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> was ready to make war if `` <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> makes it.'' `` When a frontier that seemed to be settled is thrown into question and troops mass on the other side, one is obliged to do the same thing,'' he said, without providing any details on Senegalese troop movement. He said <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> massed troops on the border along the <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, although he declined to give their precise location or number. Asked if war was possible, said it was. He said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was partially responsible for the conflict because it transferred people from one country to the other during colonial rule. Anti-Senegalese violence in <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> and violence against Mauritanians in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> in recent weeks has left an estimated 260 people dead. The dispute between the countries has long historical and racial roots, but the latest confrontation was sparked by a minor border incident near the river in April. Tens of thousands of Mauritanians and Senegalese were repatriated in a massive airlift.

The resolution, adopted on a voice vote, also calls on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s government to resolve the crisis without violence and enter a dialogue with protest leaders It says the government should end martial law and not arrest, jail, prosecute or otherwise punish those who have led and taken part in the pro-democracy movement.

 House Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was the center of speculation Wednesday as the odds-on favorite to succeed <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as speaker should the embattled <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressmen be forced to relinquish his leadership post. `` There is near unanimity of support for <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont. But as sources said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyers were negotiating a deal under which he would step down in exchange for dropping the most serious ethics charges against him, there was no guarantee that <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who has spent 25 of his 60 years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, would gain the top <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> post without opposition. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, a former prosecutor from <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, emerged as a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leader in 1974 when younger <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats overturned the long-standing seniority system. He became chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that year, and moved into the leadership in 1980 when he was made majority whip, the third-ranking position. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> was mentioned as one possible Democratic oopponent for <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, but in the supercharged political atmosphere of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in transition, there was no shortage of names mentioned for other leadership posts _ vacant or otherwise. `` I do n't think the Angel <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> could beat <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>,'' said one congressman who insisted on anonymity. But there also was talk of a `` clean sweep'' ticket that would seek to oust all members of the current leadership, including <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and majority whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> were to leave the speaker's post, the chamber's 260 Democrats would then choose a successor. Lawyers for the speaker were discussing an arrangement under which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would resign his post in exchange for the ethics committee dropping the most serious charges against him, said sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. One <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member who has been a <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> supporter said _ speaking only on condition of anonymity _ that he had found no evidence on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor that anyone was maneuvering overtly to garner support for a leadership race. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the third-ranking member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership, has his own ethics problems. The congressman has acknowledged that he failed to disclose a $ 50,000 loan from a savings and loan in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that he used toward purchase of $ 100,000 worth of junk bonds. Mentioned as the possible slate to replace the current leadership were Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> for speaker; Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> for majority leader; and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> for whip. Such a bid would be considered highly unlikely and none of those named would acknowledge any such ambition. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, an unsuccessful candidate for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, is a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> and is widely respected by his colleagues. `` I do n't want to answer hypothetical questions,'' responded <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> when asked if were planning to run for speaker _ a response considered significant for its lack of a direct denial. He was also mentioned as a potential candidate for majority leader if <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> succeeded to the speakership. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> as caucus chairman, after serving as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He is the only black in the current leadership. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' strength in speculation was based on his Southern base. Should <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resign, there would be no southerner in the leadership ranks. Othere names circulating as potential leadership candidates were two powerful committee chairmen _ Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> committee and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> were to resign, said <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, `` I would expect the majority leader, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, to be a candidate, and I support him.'' If <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> chose not to seek the speakership, `` I would consider my own options at the appropriate time,'' said <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> was described as happy with his chairmanship and unlikely to bid for the leadership. His background in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> machine politics also was considered a detriment should he change his mind.

 The Turkish breakaway state on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> claimed ownership Wednesday of sixth century mosaics already involved in a tug-of-war between an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> art dealer and the Republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> for permission to intervene in a lawsuit filed in March by the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> republic and the Greek Orthodox Church of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Experts believe the case could lead to a landmark decision on worldwide dealing in national art treasures. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> claims art dealer <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> purchased the rare mosaics illegally and they should be returned to the church. Turkish <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> asked Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noland </PERSON> to delay the civil trial, which is scheduled to begin next Tuesday. <PERSON> Noland </PERSON> did not rule immediately. `` As far as we're concerned, there can not be a full adjudication of these issues without the input of the people who have control over that land mass,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Youssouf </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Freehold </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, attorney representing the Turkish occupation state. Turks have governed the northern third of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island since Turkish forces invaded in 1974. The Turkish occupation state is not recognized by any nation except <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` You can say that something does n't exist but if you can prove that it does: has a flag, a national anthem, a population and regulates the territory from which these four mosaics were stolen ... we are a real party in this case,'' <PERSON> Youssouf </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, a county commissioner in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, bought the mosaics for $ 1.1 million in July 1988 from a Turkish dealer in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. She claims she has legal title to them under Swiss law. The rare mosaics are made of glass and were once part of a much larger work in the church of <LOCATION> Panagia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kanakaria </LOCATION> in the Cypriot village of <LOCATION> Lythrankomi </LOCATION>. The 2-foot-square mosaics depict the heads of the Christ child, the apostles <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and an archangel. Experts say they are among only a handful of artworks surviving from the first centuries of Christianity. The Republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and the Church of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> claim agents of the Turkish occupation state surreptitiously ripped the mosaics from the walls of the church in 1979. Court records show the mosaics were allowed to leave <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> under an export document purportedly signed by <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Orek </PERSON>, who acted as prime minister for <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Orek denies signing the document and will testify in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> if allowed to do so, <PERSON> Youssouf </PERSON> said. Turkish <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> is asking for the return of the mosaics for restoration in the church, unspecified damages and court costs.

 Suspected Basque separatists set a car bomb that killed three policemen and injured five other people Wednesday in this northern Basque city, a provincial spokesman said. The bomb exploded as a police bomb squad inspected a stolen car parked outside a dealership. The dealership had been damaged three hours earlier by a small bomb, said a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Vizcaya </LOCATION> province Civil Governor's office. No group immediately claimed responsibility. But the spokesman said police suspected the Basque separatist group <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks independence for the three-province northern Basque region. The explosion killed two police officers and a member of a bomb squad of the <LOCATION> Ertzainza </LOCATION>, the police force of the autonomous government of the Basque region, the spokesman said. The five injured included four police officers and a firefighter, the spokesman said. The car was stolen at gunpoint late Tuesday by two men in <LOCATION> Amorebieta </LOCATION>, a town 12 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION>, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The car's owner was found tied to a tree outside the town, he said. In its 21-year campaign for independence, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for four killings. All occurred since April 4, when <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> ended a moratorium on attacks on government targets after breaking off three months of peace talks with <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> officials.

Rep. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajoie </PERSON> gave up earlier on her bill to prohibit the sale and possession of assault weapons. `` I sense the mood of this committee but sooner or later we're going to have to keep these weapons out of the hands of people who use them for the wrong reasons,'' <PERSON> Bajoie </PERSON> said Backers of bills to set waiting periods for handgun buyers said they expect no better luck when their measures are considered Thursday. What gun control advocates failed to consider is that <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, where license plates read `` Sportsman's Paradise,'' is a largely rural state where hunting and owning guns are ways of life, said Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Scogin </PERSON>. `` You outlaw guns and only the outlaws will own them,'' said <PERSON> Scogin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said that a few months ago, a teen-ager in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> stole a shipment of Israeli-made Uzi assault weapons from a boxcar. `` He was selling them in the projects for $ 80 apiece,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` A 16-year-old has been charged with killing someone with an Uzi.''

 Actor and former football star O.J. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> must pay $ 700, perform 120 hours of community service and continue psychiatric counseling for his no-contest plea to wife beating, a judge ruled Wednesday. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, who did n't appear in court, was also placed on two years' probation by Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, 41, entered a no-contest plea Monday to one count of spousal battery through his attorney, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON>. The maximum sentence for spousal abuse is one year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. `` O.J. just decided it was in everybody's best interest not to contest the charges any longer,'' <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON> said at the time. The plea is not an admission of guilt, but allows the defendant to be judged as guilty. <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> to perform 120 hours of community service through the <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> organization in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, pay a $ 200 fine and give $ 500 to a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> shelter serving battered women. He was also ordered to undergo twice-weekly counseling, said city attorney's spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Qualls </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> has been undergoing counseling since January, he said. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, a former professional football running back who won the Heisman Trophy while at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, allegedly screamed `` I'll kill you'' as he slapped and kicked his 29-year-old wife of four years, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON>, in a pre-dawn New Year's Day argument In a statement released Wednesday, the <PERSON> Simpsons </PERSON> said the City Attorney's office had turned the incident into a `` media event and public crusade at our expense and personal embarrassment.'' The <PERSON> Simpsons </PERSON> said they wanted to `` set the record straight from the distortions and misleading news reports that our family has been subjected to.'' `` Upon returning home New Year's Eve, we got into an argument which escalated and the police were called. Fortunately, neither one of us required medical treatment,'' the couple said. `` The very next day, we talked about it and took steps to put this behind us. `` We have never been separated and our marriage is as strong as the day we were married, if not stronger.'

 The perjury trial of former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> moved closer to opening arguments Wednesday as attorneys finished questioning potential jurors. The attorneys next will choose from a group of 33 jurors, and opening arguments could come Thursday in the trial in which <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> stands accused of lying to a federal grand jury investigating money laundering, Forty-seven potential jurors were questioned over two days regarding their knowledge of the heavily publicized case and their feelings about the former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> dismissed 14. Thirteen said they possibly could not put aside their unfavorable impressions of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> and be impartial jurors, and the 14th was a former law partner of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>. At least eight of the 33 people in the jury pool said they, too, had unfavorable opinions about <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> but could put them aside and decide the case on the basis of the evidence. The potential juror pool also includes one woman, a former <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> fund-raiser, who said she `` admires'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> but promised to be open-minded. Defense attorneys have asked the judge to move the trial because of extensive publicity, but <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said he would rule only after hearing from potential jurors. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is accused of lying under oath in early 1988 to a federal grand jury investigating his dealings with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, an associate and now-admitted money launderer, and a federal agent posing as a money broker for probable drug dealers. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal grand jury, each of which carries a penalty of 10 months to five years in prison on conviction. The indictment contends <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> lied in concealing from the grand jury his discussions of how to cover up the sources of an $ 850,000 loan to be used to pay for his home. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> returned uncashed a check for the first installment of the loan. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a two-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman, lost his seat representing <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s eastern suburbs to Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> last November.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told an international delegation Wednesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to blame for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political crisis. `` We told them our truth,'' the general, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader, said in a brief statement after meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> delegates for 2 -LCB- hours. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of the armed forces, told a news conference the three-hour meeting had been `` postive'' and gave the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> `` an opportunity to express their idea about the economic aggression ... and the foreign intervention that caused the deterioration'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` Each officer spoke of his concept of this reality,'' he went on. `` We talked about the intimidation, of outrages, of excessive foreign presence and intimidation by air, sea, land, submarine ... even the ozone layer has suffered intervention,'' he joked. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent about 2,000 extra <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after the government nullified the May 7 presidential election and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters beat up opposition candidates. When he was asked what he planned to do, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> thought a second and said, `` That's the million dollar question.'' An aide said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told the delegation his resignation is an issue that would be decided by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, not by an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> request. International observers say the election was won by opposition candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>. The government said <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> won. The delegation, led by <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, included foreign ministers <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Palencia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sahadeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Basdeo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>. Earlier, the delegates met with leaders of the opposition and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition leaders told the delegation they wanted their election victory recognized and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> retired. `` We want democracy and justice for the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said after meeting with the delegation. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two vice-presidential candidates, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, were accompanied by 300 cheering supporters as they marched several blocks from a church to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation's hotel. About 25 riot police wielding bullhorns peacefully dispersed the crowd. Opposition spokesmen said one bodyguard and an <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> aide were arrested. Acting president <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said no new elections were possible before Sept. 1, when his term as `` minister in charge of the presidency'' is supposed to end. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> told a meeting of bureaucrats that new balloting could not be held because of the expense and `` because of the psychological condition of the Panmanian people after the trauma of the elections.'' He suggested he would continue in office, citing an administrative code that says a person must serve until he is replaced. `` Juridically, there is no problem, but politically we will have to define a transfer of power,'' he said, adding, `` It could possibly be the succession of one person by another of the same group.'' After the nullification, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution criticizing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and calling for `` a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.'' `` We want recognition of our electoral victory and the retirement of General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We will not betray the people. The May 7 vote is a mandate from God,'' said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> listened but did n't want to comment. They said they would like to meet again.'' The march Wednesday marked the fourth time the opposition has defied a government ban on demonstrations in effect until June 5, when the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> commission is due to file its report. On Tuesday night, the Panamanian government presented its case against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s government has said it hoped the mission would `` establish the truth of the crisis as a conflict between <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' and cited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions as proof of malice. The government also has proclaimed it will accept no interference in internal <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> affairs and that some aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> resolution violate the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> charter. The first street demonstrations against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule began in June of 1987. Since then <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges, charges he says are part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to renege on its commitment to give up the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> at the end of 1999.

<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, his political career of 35 years in shambles, bargained through lawyers Wednesday to resign his leadership post in exchange for the dismissal of some of the ethics charges confronting him. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> denied that he was considering stepping down and issued a statement saying he would `` press ahead'' with his defense. Even so, Democrats were looking beyond his departure to selection of a succcessor _ and apparently closing ranks behind Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s representatives shuttled through a daylong series of meetings with key members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a bid to nail down an unprecedented agreement stripping him of his post as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and second in line of succession to the presidency within a week. The extraordinary drama of political abdication overwhelmed normal business at the Capitol, even though it was played out almost exclusively behind closed doors. `` What I know is that negotiations are taking place that deal with resolving this issue very soon,' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION> `` They involve dropping one of the charges in exchange for the speaker resigning the post, and it's something that will probably be settled in the next 24 to 48 hours.'' Other sources suggested it would be next week before the issue was resolved. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said he understood <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would retain his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat under the terms of the discussions. But there was no word on whether the Speaker would seek re-election from his <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> congressional district in 1990. Other sources said the deal involved dropping conflict-of-interest charges that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> accepted gifts of housing and a car and salary for his wife. If those charges were dropped, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> could step down as early as next week, the sources said. But sources said the committee was not receptive to any arrangement that would clear <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of charges that he evaded <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside income through bulk sales of his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' One congressman familiar with the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a majority of the ethics committee favored some sort of negotiated settlement. But the ethics committee adjourned late Wednesday until June 1 without acting on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s case, and sources said the negotiations were continuing. Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., the panel's chairman met at one point during the afternoon with <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to discuss <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s situation At the same time, the timing of any resignation was uncertain, and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican, said, `` I personally am opposed to any arrangements, deals, plea bargaining.'' `` It's kind of a dance _ a very tentative kind of dance,'' said one House member, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. In the background, the politics of succession flourished. `` There is near unanimity of support for <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'' as speaker, said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont. `` There would be no campaign'' for the top leadership post, he said. Even so, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> was careful not to dampen speculation that he might seek the speaker's job, and a long list of contenders was mentioned to take <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s rung on the leadership ladder and vie for other spots. The party's whip, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, caucus chairman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, deputy whip <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> headed the roster of potential candidates. House Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., who normally has avoided comment on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s plight, said: `` I guess if I had that kind of a problem, I would n't be around here If the conditions were exactly the same and I were dragging my party into the kind of area that I see ... I'd have no alternative but to step aside.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who spent his day in a serious of meetings with his supporters and his leadership team, left the Capitol early in the evening without speaking to reporters. The speaker also issued a statement saying: `` I very firmly believe that my position is right. I hope and trust that the committee will consider the matter on its merits and dismiss the charges. `` I eagerly await the time and opportunity when my side of this whole question may be heard clearly by my colleagues and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. To this end, I shall press ahead.'' Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, a member of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s defense team, met with ethics committee counsel <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> and made the initial offer, the sources said. The proposal ran into opposition from ethics committee Republicans and still was being negotiated, said the sources, who commented only on condition they not be named. The ethics committee _ made up of six Democrats and six Republicans _ met for much of the day in private, deliberating <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s motion to dismiss the two most serious allegations. The chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., promised a `` fresh look,'' but there was no indication any of the committee members had been persuaded Other signs were ominous for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, as fellow <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrats began to talk openly of growing odds against his keeping his post. The most serious allegations facing <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> are that he used bulk sales of an autobiographical book to evade rules limiting outside income and that he improperly took gifts from a developer friend who had a direct interest in legislation. Earlier Wednesday, entering a luncheon with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrats, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was asked about widespread speculation that he was considering stepping aside as speaker until the ethics case is resolved. `` No, I'm not,'' he answered. Asked whether his political position was eroding, he said, `` I do n't feel that at all.'' However, a fellow <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, said, `` There is some hint <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> might step aside, at least temporarily, until this whole thing is resolved.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, an elder statesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a member of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s legal defense team, for 1 -LCB- hours Wednesday morning, and <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON> later met with ethics committee attorney <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>. When asked whether there was a deal in the works to drop some of the charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in return for his stepping down, the speaker's spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, declined comment. `` There's no question the speaker is in serious trouble,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` The speaker's problems have translated into institutional problems for all of us. The institution is getting a black eye.'' <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON> said some of his constituents now are telling him the evidence against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is overwhelming and that `` where there's that much smoke, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, there's got ta be a spark somewhere. He added: `` There obviously have been some mistakes made, some rules if not broken, bent severely.'' `` Public opinion is weighted against him at this time,'' added <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>. `` I think the die is cast. There is still a glimmer of hope he might survive. But the cards are stacked against him.'' Rep. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, D-Ind., who previously called for a leadership change, embraced the idea of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> stepping down at least temporarily and appointing a replacement `` There is a state of continuing erosion of public confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and I do n't think that's a good state for anybody,'' <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. On Tuesday night, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had told reporters: `` I want to be an effective person in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and I've had that privilege. Most of all now I want to protect my good name and that of my family and my wife and my colleagues.'' The ethics committee's two senior members indicated there was nothing new in the fiery arguments they heard a day earlier from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, during a televised hearing. `` My mind was n't changed,'' said <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, the committee's senior Republican. `` There were no new points raised, absolutely no new points.'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said, `` I think Mr. <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> indicated in his remarks that he was not optimistic that any or all of them would be dismissed, but I do think we have a responsibility to reassess that and give it a fresh look.''

<TEXT>
 Nearly 200 teachers went on strike Wednesday in the first serious display of worker discontent since January, when the government announced a tough austerity plan to fight 20,000-percent inflation. Educators at two schools split from the national union and gave the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government a deadline to answer demands for pay raises and other improvements. The pro-Sandinista <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> ANDEN </ORGANIZATION> by its Spanish initials, struck a conciliatory note. The nationwide labor union backed most demands but warned `` pro-imperialist and rightist pseudo-leaders'' against instigating strikes. `` This is the crucial moment to reach our vindication and we ca n't lose it,'' said teacher <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON>. `` This is the awakening of the teaching profession.'' Monthly salaries now range from $ 21.62 for high school teachers to $ 81.08 for college professors. <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON> is a member of the negotiating committee from the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Experimental Center, one of two schools in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> that gave the government until Thursday afternoon to answer the teachers' demands for better pay and working conditions. The Mexico Experimental Center, a high school, has 120 teachers, while the other school, <PERSON> Maestro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, has 112 teachers. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION>, a town 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the entire force of 198 teachers was on `` indefinite strike until our situation has been solved,'' said <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, principal at the <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> <PERSON> Aviles </PERSON> elementary school. `` Today they came -LRB- from the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- with an offer which we did n't think is correct,'' said <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON>. `` The 5,000 cordobas we earn daily does n't cover anything. You buy a soft drink and a piece of bread and there goes your 5,000 cordobas.'' <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> said the 47 teachers at the school earn an average 150,000 cordobas monthly and they are demanding a tripling of the salary, `` although even 600,000 cordobas a month would barely cover a family's basic needs.'' At the current rate of exchange of 7,400 cordobas to the dollar, 150,000 cordobas equals $ 20.27 and 600,000 is worth $ 81.08. <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON>, principal of the <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> high school in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION>, said representatives of the teachers would meet with government officials on Thursday. The government also has been meeting with teachers in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to negotiate a solution, but already it has said that granting pay raises would undo its anti-inflationary measures. Inflation in 1988 reached more than 20,000 percent. <ORGANIZATION> ANDEN </ORGANIZATION> issued a communique saying the teachers had legitimate grievances but a pay raise would `` make inflation explosive and would not contribute to the logic of the -LRB- government's -RRB- economic measures.'' Barricada, the official newspaper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, accused right-wing politicians and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy of trying to `` manipulate'' the teachers' discontent.

<HEAD>Negotiators in Teachers Strike Grow Less Inflammatory, More Optimistic</HEAD>

 The teachers strike in the nation's second-largest district went into its 11th day Wednesday without the inflammatory statements that had prompted state legislators to admonish negotiators to stop bickering Negotiators for the teachers' union and the school district expressed optimism about reaching an agreement as they headed into talks late in the day. `` I am hopeful that we will emerge with a contract and people will go back to work tomorrow,'' school board President <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> said. `` I think that the time has come for the offer the board has made to be accepted ... I am very optimistic, I certainly expect that we'll have some good news.'' <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teachers-Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told reporters that a private meeting both sides had with state legislators in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> on Tuesday spurred resumption of talks. `` I think that it brought a sense of realism to both sides that ... there is serious concern about what is going on in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the powerful legislators, influential people, want this thing settled,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> also told reporters, `` I think there is an expectation that there will be some movement and possibly a settlement tonight.'' In another development, a striking teacher was booked Wednesday on assault charges of throwing a rock at a substitute teacher. Sheriff's deputies said the rock missed the teacher's car and struck a 12-year-old girl. She was treated at a hospital for a cut on her head, said sheriff's spokesman Deputy <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. The teachers are seeking a 26 percent raise over three years. School board members have said they boosted their offer to a 24 percent pay raise over three years, with the second year raise contingent on receiving state surplus funds. Otherwise, it will drop to 5 -LCB- percent. Teachers earn between $ 23,440 and $ 43,319 a year, depending on experience and level of education. Education in the district has slowed to a crawl since the union representing 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers went on strike May 15. Most classes wind up June 23, but some schools operate year-round.

 <PERSON> A.A. </PERSON> `` Abe'' <PERSON> Schechter </PERSON>, the first news director for <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> and the first executive producer of the `` Today'' show, and his wife, <PERSON> Fritzi </PERSON>, died Wednesday in a car accident. He was 81. Mrs. <PERSON> Schechter </PERSON>, who was 82, was driving the couple's car when it ran off a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> highway and struck a tree, <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> police said. <PERSON> Schechter </PERSON> was the author of `` Go Ahead Garrison,'' published in 1940, and co-wrote `` I Live on Air,'' both books describing his exploits in journalism. In the second book, published in 1941, he told of the time he directed an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reporter to set up for what was intended to be the first broadcast from the base of the Egyptian pyramids at a time when remote broadcasts were rare and difficult. The radio reporter arrived to find a CBS reporter already on the air from the opposite side of the pyramid. He phoned <PERSON> Schechter </PERSON> for directions and was told `` then go to the top of the pyramid.'' The order became a catch-phrase for producers to dramatize the importance of being first. <PERSON> Schechter </PERSON> was born in Central Falls, R.I. He worked at The Providence -LRB- <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> as a reporter before he became an editor in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

 A <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> man who was allergic to nuts died after eating a <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> nut and an almond he was given by a female companion, authorities said. <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, 38, ate the nuts Monday while driving near <LOCATION> Heffley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> just north of here and about 270 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, said Coroner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> and the woman, whom <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> did not identify, stopped for gas, she bought a bag of nuts and began eating them as they resumed driving, the coroner said. `` She offered him a <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> nut,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. `` Then she offered him an almond. `` Then he turned to her and told her ` I'm allergic to nuts.''' They returned to <LOCATION> Heffley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, but by the time an ambulance arrived, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>'s heart had stopped from the allergic reaction, said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. He said he knew of only one other similar case in the region, a youth who died five minutes after eating a chocolate bar containing nuts. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> apparently offered no explanation to the woman, a casual acquaintance, for eating the nuts. `` I guess he was just driving along with his mind in neutral,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. `` They were offered to him and he took them.''

 Hoards of homeless wo n't be dispatched in bus loads to this celebrity beach retreat in spite of actor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>'s official welcome for them in his capacity as honorary mayor. `` There will not be any buses. Things have spiraled to such a degree they are out of my control,'' <PERSON> Rush </PERSON> <PERSON> Limbaugh </PERSON>, a nationally syndicated radio talk show host who had threatened to organize a homeless `` March on <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>,'' said Wednesday. <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>'s declaration offering <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> as a nuclear-free, homeless sanctuary triggered <PERSON> Limbaugh </PERSON>'s proposal to arrive Saturday with busloads of indigents. But the continuing uproar gave <PERSON> Limbaugh </PERSON> second thoughts. `` Call me a coward, call me a wimp, but I am doing what is right,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The bottom line is that I will not be able to guarantee their safety.'' <PERSON> Limbaugh </PERSON>, a conservative, has been needling <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> and what he calls the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> `` left coast'' for years, and <PERSON> Limbaugh </PERSON> had maintained busing homeless to <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> was a fair response to <ORGANIZATION> Sheen </ORGANIZATION>'s declaration But on Wednesday he said, `` I do n't have to bring a bunch of homeless down there to prove my point.

 Nuclear-tipped antibodies that seek and destroy cancer inside the body show promise of giving doctors a new way to attack tumors, researchers say. The goal is to blitz cancer cells with huge doses of killer radiation. Doctors launch the attack with protein probes that hunt down the cancer deep within the body. In initial experimental use, researchers found that the strategy wiped out all detectable cancer in people who were not helped by ordinary treatment. However, far more study will be necessary before researchers know for sure whether this approach will cure cancer. The findings were presented Tuesday by Dr. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> to the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oncology </ORGANIZATION>.

 Women who experienced natural menopause before age 45 tended to die sooner than other women in a new study, suggesting early menopause may indicate the body is aging faster than normal.

<HEAD>Gospel Missions Serving Widened Range Of Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gospel rescue missions, long a champion in the inner city for the homeless, are responding to a whole new range of needs that were practically unthinkable even a decade ago. Expansion in the role of these downtown missions was highlighted at the recent annual convention of representatives of about 300 such missions in cities across the country. It long has been a stereotype that they mostly serve older alcoholics and drug abusers. However, young adults, women and children are just as likely to seek help these days. That has put a growing load on rescue missions to meet needs not met by state or other agencies. `` In the last 10 to 15 years, things have changed drastically,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gospel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missions </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've been called on to do things we had n't done before. A look at some of the issues raised at the <ORGANIZATION> IUGM </ORGANIZATION>'s 76th annual conference here earlier this month tells part of the story: AIDS, children's nutrition, unschooled minors, battered women, drugs. It used to be almost unheard of to have to worry about children in the missions, <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> commented at the close of the five-day conference. But women and children now are the fastest growing proportion of those served, now amounting to about 40 percent. <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, nephew of retired <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, in August will become executive director of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> organization which oversees some 300 rescue missions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He says there has been a vast upheaval in the social fabric of this country. `` Today there are millions of homeless in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ a population that continues to grow and become more diverse,'' he says. No city has been left untouched by the homeless problem, he notes, suggesting a look at the shuttered up steel-mill towns of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, or a place like <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> -LRB- population 15,000 -RRB-. `` I thought of that as a picturebook place and here they were with the fishing industry falling apart, the lumber industry falling apart, alcoholism on the rise. And all of a sudden,'' recalls <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, `` we have a homeless problem.'' <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION> is one of a number of cities across the country which have turned to the <ORGANIZATION> IUGM </ORGANIZATION> in setting up programs for the homeless and what <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> calls the `` near-homeless,'' or those people whose whole condition is unstable and regularly move in and out of the system. He says there is agreement on causes of the homeless crisis: the disintegration of the family, changing values, drug and alcohol abuse, a changing economy. What is not so clear are what the solutions will be. But there is reason to hope, <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> says. `` The church has become awakened to the possibilities.'' He says there are more volunteers, and churches which over the years have tended to move away from the inner city are getting more involved. He says one key is to persuade people to pitch in. `` Part of the problem is we've challenged but we have n't told them what to do. You have to provide the vehicle to get people downtown,'' a formidable task, <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> says, when there are already so many demands on people's daily lives. Another key, he adds, is creating innovative programs to help those trying to rebuild shattered lives. `` Even those of us in this work can get a fortress mentality.. and not see the new needs _ the mentally ill, the Hispanics, the folks being dumped out of hospitals, the elderly being kicked out of homes being turned into condos,'' <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> says. `` Government can provide funding, but it ca n't get involved with people on a personal level to help overcome years of abuse, alcoholism. ...'' <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> says the thinking now must be: `` How do you get that person to see, with God's help, what they can do'' as well as `` What are you doing to keep people out of the mission.'' Under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, the homeless could fare better, he believes. `` I think the problem is quite obvious at this point and it seems -LRB- Secretary of Housing and Urban Development -RRB- <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has a real commitment,'' <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> says. For others out in the communities wanting to commit themselves to the homeless issue, <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> plans to develop videos of model programs across the country.

<HEAD>Congressional Tap Dance</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This was supposed to be National Tap Dance Day, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> never got around to proclaiming it. It's had trouble getting around to a lot of things this year. This was going to be the historic, high-powered 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. So far, the bicentennial session has been long on ceremony and heavy on intramural disputes. Chief among them now is the ethics case against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the top Democratic official in the government, struggling to hold onto his job. As he tried to get the major charges dismissed, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyer suggested to the ethics committee that the tough line against the speaker is part of the fallout from other episodes _ such as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejection of the nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to be secretary of defense; and the continuing effort to deal with the savings and loan crisis. Along with those issues came one in which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> himself played the leading role, the 50 percent congressional pay raise originally programmed to go through without a vote. It was derailed and defeated after a public outcry led the speaker to put it to a roll call. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s own ethics case is a distraction or worse, although other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders insist it has not diverted the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from conducting its regular business. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> himself takes a somewhat different line, insisting the charges are unfounded and should be dropped so that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can concentrate on the work of governing. Three major measures that have passed this session are a $ 1.17 trillion federal budget for the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1, a measure providing limited aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and a $ 4.55 hourly minimum wage bill. The budget was n't really legislated; it was negotiated with the administration, at the urging of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. To make the deal, the negotiators put aside contentious tax and spending questions until next year. `` It's no more smoke and mirrors than in the past,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the budget committee. And he said the process that produced the budget agreement is itself a stride toward a better way of doing things in the future. The Contra package was a negotiated deal, too, and it is subject to an intricate system of congressional vetoes. The minimum wage increase will be an issue, not a law, for a while yet. The Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> raised the rate past the level <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would accept, but by margins that are not wide enough to override a veto. The lines are drawn on that one, and despite his preference for compromise and bipartisanship, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't afford to back down. That does n't add up to much of a season as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes its Memorial Day recess. Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., said his college-age son was driving to work with him the other day when they spotted a bumper sticker on the car ahead: `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deserves </LOCATION> a Better Congress. `` I said ` What do you think of that, son?' He said, ` Well, I think they're right.''' Early in the session, Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, introduced his joint resolution to designate today as National Tap Dance Day, this being the birthday of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> `` Bojangles'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in 1878. He proposed to honor <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, `` King of the Tap Dancers,'' and `` to refocus the attention of the nation on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tap dancing.'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., introduced the resolution in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and added some more Bojangles lore `` He coined the phrase ` everything is copasetic,' which means it's going along just fine,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, this phrase no longer holds true for the art form he brought to near perfection.'' Nor for the resolution, which never got to the floor for the routine approval that is customary on such commemorative measures. But then, not much is copasetic in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> these days.

 Treat <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who made a name for himself playing offbeat characters in often obscure films earlier in his career, has been on a mainstream roll lately. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> played a hippie in the film version of the musical `` Hair,'' a cop tugged by divided loyalties in `` Prince of the City,'' a charming airliner hijacker in `` The Pursuit of D.B. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>,'' and a seedy <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON> in `` Smooth Talk.'' In `` Third Degree Burn,'' premiering Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>, he plays a more accessible character, a hard-luck private detective. He also plays a Drug Enforcement Agent in next season's <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries, `` Desperados: The ` <PERSON> Kiki </PERSON>' Camarena Story'' and a reporter in the theatrical film `` The Heart of Dixie.'' `` I've had a tendency in the past to play characters more on the edge of normalcy,'' he said. `` In my younger years I was more into character work and not leading men. As I've gotten into my late 30s, I'm playing characters in the mainstream of life, not on the edge of life like my character in ` Smooth Talk.' `` The screenplays that writers are writing for men in their late 30s are more interesting. The characters are more interesting, life is more complex, and they are more complex. They've lived longer and had more experiences. The simple fact of the mechanics of the business is that you try to find the best role in the best story directed by the best director that you can among all the options available to you.'' The movie `` The Heart of Dixie'' also stars <PERSON> Ally </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cates </PERSON>. It takes place in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> but was filmed in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, Miss. `` I spent two months on the picture but I did n't work that much on it,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` I got to travel and see a lot of the South.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is now preparing for a Broadway musical version of `` <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Gantry </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' story of a 1930s evangelist who turned out to be a charlatan. It will be his first musical since `` The Pirates of Penzance.'' Meanwhile, he is completing his role as <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> in `` Desperadoes.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> also star in the miniseries, which is being filmed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Since it deals with political corruption in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> it could not be filmed there. In `` Third Degree Burn,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>, a former policeman who supports himself by investigating small-time divorce cases. He's hired to check up on <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholes </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON>. `` Scott has an Achilles heel which sets the plot in motion,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` He has a tendency to sleep with other men's wives. He becomes involved with the woman he's investigating. He becomes ensnared in a trap that includes murder and spends most of his time trying to figure out how he got there. `` It's a film noir,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` I hope it does n't seem imitative. I'm sure every story has been told at least once. We were trying to tell a contemporary story, but it certainly falls into the category of film noir.'' The movie, directed by <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Spottiswoode </PERSON>, was filmed in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, usually flies to locations in his own two-engine <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION>. `` I have as much flying time as most airline co-pilots,'' he said. `` I call it <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> for Treat <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.'' He began flying while at the <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. `` My high school coach lost my ring,'' he explained. `` He said he could n't pay me the $ 35, but since he was a flying instructor he would give me two free lessons. I soloed when I was 17 and bought my first plane when I was 21 and doing ` Grease' on Broadway.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was married last June to <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Sant </PERSON>, a modern dancer and actress. They were married by one of his former classmates, now an Episcopal minister and headmaster of the <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. He calls his place in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> a `` farmette.'' It has an 1826 farmhouse and on one side is a dairy farm and on the other side is a horse farm. `` It's a beautiful place,'' he said. `` We have an extraordinary view of the <LOCATION> Equinox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Arming Yourself Against Investment Scams</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the legitimate investment world has boomed in the 1980s, so has its dark underside, where the ripoff artists ply their trade. Stories abound of operations selling `` gold'' that is actually dirt, penny stocks at pumped-up prices, packages of government securities that never existed, and tax shelter deals that ca n't stand up to the slightest scrutiny Of course, financial scams are just about as old as the history of money. A lot of the ploys in use today are merely recycled versions of schemes dreamed up long ago. But the volatility of all securities markets in this decade, and the fast-buck atmosphere it has helped foster, seems to have created an especially fertile breeding ground for financial phony business. `` We've never been this aware of so many frauds in things such as penny stocks, coins, gold piles and so forth,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an analyst at the Wall Street firm of <ORGANIZATION> Legg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. One apparent cause of this, <PERSON> DeVoe </PERSON> says, is the proliferation of new investment vehicles that Wall Street has devised to offer to pension fund managers and other sophisticated clients `` Some of the financial creations of the last few years are so bizarre that even professionals do n't completely understand them,'' he observes. `` Because the legitimate financial creations are so complex, it is very hard to tell them from the phony ones.'' All this leaves many individuals who have money to manage in a tough spot: How to protect themselves while still attempting to invest their money productively. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Finlay </PERSON> at the Cleveland-based investment firm of <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Turben </PERSON> suggests three basic rules: `` Beware of very high yields. Know the person with whom you do business. Do n't make hasty decisions `` It seems laughable that many people spend more time selecting a necktie or dress than investing their life savings,'' <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> observed in the firm's monthly publication Investor News. A prime tool of the scammer's trade is the telephone. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> acknowledges that many above-board investments are promoted over the phone. But it has published a list of tips for dealing with what you suspect is a `` boiler room'' operation selling questionable or fraudulent goods. Among the association's most compelling recommendations: The harder a telephone salesperson presses, the wiser it is to resist. If a caller turns abusive, hang up. Do n't fall for any claims of spectacular rewards or promised `` guarantees'' until you can verify the legitimacy of the deal and have a clear picture of all the risks involved. If you ca n't understand an investment, do n't buy it without the counsel of a trusted and knowledgeable adviser Never give your credit-card number to a stranger on the phone. Be especially suspicious of propositions involving delayed delivery of the investment in question. Likewise, look warily at any deal in which the seller proposes some unusual arrangement to collect your money, such as sending a messenger to pick up your check. `` Some con artists try to avoid mail fraud charges by using overnight courier services,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASAA </ORGANIZATION> points out. A deregulated financial world is also a let-the-buyer-beware world requiring a good deal of healthy skepticism. That means mustering the strongest doubts when the caller's voice is most persuasive, or when the name of the purported business is most impressive-sounding Fly-by-night boiler rooms have been known to call themselves `` national exchanges,'' `` research institutes,'' `` bureaus,'' in fact almost anything but what they really are.

<HEAD>Housing _ A Time To Buy?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With asking prices below their highs of a few months ago, with large numbers of unsold houses on the market and with interest rates falling, an investment opportunity may be developing in single-family housing. While such opportunities are more common in housing than in most markets, partly because housing is made up of a greater percentage of amateur versus professional sellers, as in cars, they are transitory. In fact, as soon as such opportunities appear, they begin to vanish. That's the housing market for you, up and down more sharply than other markets, and always exaggerating the usual economic cycle. Bust to boom and back to bust. The most important element in the opening for buyers is the general decline of interest rates, which many forecasters expect will continue right through the year. Interest rates are key, since interest is the biggest housing expense for those who take out 20-year or 30-year mortgages, sometimes equalling the total cost of all other factors, including land and the structure itself. When you have a combination of lower rates and relatively softer prices _ asking prices that are below their earlier highs or that are negotiable _ you have a buying opportunity. Now add to that a big inventory of unsold units. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> estimated the inventory of unsold homes at more than 2.9 million units, or a nine-month supply of existing homes and 7.5-month supply of new houses. What that means is a lot of unhappy sellers. While they could rationalize the inattention given to their offerings during the winter, when weather and mood keep people from shopping, they are now in the prime selling months. Another factor enters the picture: The news about housing has a rather dismal cast of late. Just a month or two ago, for example, sellers and buyers were loudly lamenting the deadly duo of rising prices and interest rates. In many areas those factors have changed _ in some they have been reversed _ but the mood lingers, keeping many potential buyers from the market It is, of course, a situation that can change overnight. It has happened before. Still another factor is involved in the potential investment opportunity. If the price of the house purchased today is to have greater market value tomorrow, it would help tremendously if future housing were in short supply. There is no proof that such a situation will develop, but it should be noted that the number of residential building permits issued in 1989 could be the lowest in seven years. Future demand, therefore, might not be met. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> forecasts 1.02 million single-family housing starts this year, a figure that would make 1989 the weakest homebuilding year since 1983. <PERSON> Lomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortgage </PERSON> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, a large mortgage lender, estimates new housing permits this year at 1.394 million, 21 percent lower than in 1986. Building activity today creates tomorrow's markets, and if building this year is weak it could tip tomorrow's buyer-seller balance. Those who buy today, that is, conceivably could find market values higher a few years hence.

<HEAD>Count of Women Clergy Doubles In Decade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women ordained to the church's `` full ministry'' _ preaching the word and administering the sacraments _ has about doubled in the last decade. They total 20,730, as statistically projected, nearly twice the 10,470 of 1977. They now constitute 7.9 percent of the clergy in denominations ordaining women. That percentage also has about doubled, from 4 percent, and seems likely for a further steep increase as indicated by the boom in women enrollment in seminaries. The figures were gathered by Constant <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacquet </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of the research office of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. His report says women still face some discrimination, but adds: `` There has been an increasing acceptance of women clergy in local church situtations especially by younger people and by those of higher educational attainment. `` Women have also gained acceptance as pastors once they have been given the opportunity to demonstrate their competence in preaching and pastoral care at the local level.'' Among mainline denominations, the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> -LRB- merged in 1988 into the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> -RRB- had the highest percentage of women heads of local pastoral staffs, more than half its clergywomen. American Baptist also ranked high in this category. Among mainliners, Lutherans and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> had the highest perentage of women clergy serving in local congregations generally. Getting on the staff of a local church, particularly as chief pastor or head of staff, is considered a key measure of acceptance of women clergy. It also is seen as a common obstacle. `` Women clergy appear to be more easily accepted in church employment outside the local church at various denominational administrative offices, in ecumenical conciliar positions and in many institutional roles,'' the report says. Among 221 denominations included in the survey, 84 of them ordain women and 82 do not, with uncertainty about it in 49 others. Six do not ordain clergy at all. The proportion of denominations ordaining women had grown little since 1977, when 76 ordained women and 82 did not. However, those ordaining women had now become a slight majority, 84 to 82. With totals projected as of 1986, the Assemblies of God led the field in numbers of women clergy, 3,718 of them, up from 1,572, or 137 percent. Others among the next ranked l0, and their decade's increase or decrease in women clergy, were: <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, 3,220, up from 3,037, or 6 percent <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, 1,891, up from 319, or 496 percent. Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> -RRB-, 1,519, up from 370, or 310 percent. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, 1,460, up from 400, or 265 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, 796, up from 94, or 747 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Disciples of Christ -RRB-, 743, up from 388, or 91 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, 484, up from 55, or 780 percent. International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, 666, down from 804, or 17 percent. Southern Baptist Convention, 450, up from 20, or 2,150 percent. American Baptist Churches, 429, up from 157, or 173 percent. Apart from those numerical rankings, other large percentage gains in women clergy were by the <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which went from one to 42 of them, up by 4,100 percent. Also, the American <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- now also merged into the <ORGANIZATION> Evanelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> -RRB-, increased women clergy from 18 to 306, or 1,600 percent, while the Menonites went from four to 48, up 1,100 percent. In the smaller Mormon branch, the Reorganized Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>, women's ordination was authorized only in 1984, and since has shot up from none to 860, the report says. In some instances, the numbers of women clergy dropped. The Church of the Nazarene count fell from 426 to 355, a 17 percent drop. Like the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, some larger, conservative <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> churches do not ordain women, including the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. The present fundamentalist administration of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> opposes women's ordination, but the report shows the denomination's women clergy, up from 20 to 450, have multiplied more than 20 times. Congregations in that denomination are autonomous and may ordain without higher approval, but few have hired women pastors. Until recent times, the increase in women clergy was relatively slow. It took 27 years for the 1950 total of 5,591, most of them among Pentecostals or para-church groups, to double by 1977. Now that most mainline denominations ordain women, the totals have zoomed, doubling again in one decade. The report says: `` There is every reason to believe that the percentage of women ordained will continue to increase ... as women gain wider acceptance in the various denominations based on demonstrated performance and on the changing attitudes of those currently opposing equal roles for women.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Babes in Arms'' is the <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> musical that people think they know _ and do n't. What everybody recalls is the folklore that has obscured this classic `` Come on kids, let's put on a show'' musical that introduced such standards as `` My Funny Valentine,'' `` The Lady Is a Tramp,'' `` Johnny One Note,'' `` I Wish I Were in Love Again'' and `` Where or When.'' They remember the vastly different _ and softer _ <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy-style </PERSON> movie starring <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> and not the Broadway musical which opened two years earlier at the Shubert Theater with a cast of young unknown performers that included <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dailey </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Heatherton </PERSON>, father of <PERSON> Joey </PERSON>. It is a concert revival of the original Broadway version that will grace <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> Hall June 5. Performers include <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Graae </PERSON> and a singing group called J.Q. and the Bandits. Some of the book will be performed, but <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> will serve as narrator to tie together some of the plot developments. The concert, a benefit for the <ORGANIZATION> Starlight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> which helps critically ill children, will be presented and conducted by <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON>, a Juilliard-trained musician who has conducted at the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> and other opera companies. He will lead the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Spialek </PERSON>'s original orchestrations. `` This show has a unique place in musical theater history,'' says <PERSON> Haile </PERSON>. `` ` Babes in Arms' is a score that has five standards but has n't been done in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since its premiere. And the original book is much more interesting in a lot of ways than the later versions because it deals with social issues.'' The story for `` Babes in Arms,'' which <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> also wrote as well as the music and lyrics, is set during the Depression. It concerns the children of out-of-work vaudeville performers who put on a revue so they will not be sent to a work farm. The show flops but the kids are saved in Act 2 when a trans-Atlantic flyer, a Frenchman named <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Flambeau </PERSON>, crashes in the area and helps the teen-agers out of their financial predicament. `` There is a whole argument about socialism vs. capitalism in the musical,'' said <PERSON> Haile </PERSON>, explaining what was in the original script. `` One of the other big issues in the show is that when the children find an underwriter for the show they are trying to put on, they discover he's a bigot and wo n't let the two black kids -LRB- played in the original by the <ORGANIZATION> Nicholas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- go into the show.'' That was the musical's first act finale. When the curtain came up the on the second act, the kids were on the work farm and the black performers did not reappear in the show. The show boosts several lesser known <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> songs such as `` You Are So Fair'' and `` Imagine,'' as well as two long ballet sequences, originally choreographed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>. The music from both will be performed at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> although in abridged versions, particularly the `` Johnny One Note'' ballet which consists of some 12 minutes of the song repeated in the same key. Even stage versions of `` Babes in Arms'' that audiences have seen over the last three decades have been different than the original, says <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> who oversees the rentals of <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> musicals as manager of the <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Hammerstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>. In the 1950s and'60s, according to <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> encouraged revised versions of three or four <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> shows which were basically not being produced at all. That quartet included `` Babes in Arms.'' `` I can only surmise that in the 1950s he felt the way to get the <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> shows performed more, was to do more up-to-date versions,'' <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> said. `` With ` Babes in Arms,' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON> wrote a new book that was what everybody thought ` Babes in Arms' was from the beginning _ a summer stock musical, kids in the barn on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> trying to put on a show.'' `` Babes in Arms'' has had very few major revivals over the last half century. The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Municipal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> performed it in 1940; <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> starred in a production at the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Poinciana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Playhouse </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in 1959; and the <ORGANIZATION> Goodspeed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had its own version with <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> McArdle </PERSON> of `` Annie'' fame in 1979. `` The revised version by Oppenheimer that we rent does very well in high schools, but more and more, as people are becoming aware of originals, they are asking for originals,'' <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> said. `` There has been interest but it has never been followed through with ` Babes in Arms.' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Bramble </PERSON> -LRB- co-author of the book for `` 42nd Street'' -RRB- wanted to do a production in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> based more on the original but that did n't work.'' Haile's concert presentation could awake interest in `` Babes in Arms'' again. Already several recording companies have indicated they might want to record the show.

<HEAD>Bette Midler Stars in Remake of Stella Dallas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's 1937, and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanwyck </PERSON> playing the outcast <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> watches from outside as her daughter gets married. It is one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s classic tear-jerking scenes. Flash forward to 1989. The feisty, funny <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> is starring in a remake that the production team says updates the old concepts of high society but keeps the basic story intact. So, instead of <PERSON> Stanwyck </PERSON> needing to chase after a rich husband to make her unsuccessful attempt to move upward, <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> can grumpily tell her friend how she told off the rich guy and does n't need his money. The new version, called `` Stella,'' was filmed in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> this spring for a planned release in the winter. The handkerchiefs, though, will still be needed. At the end, just as her predecessor did, <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> will be watching from outside at her daughter's elegant <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> wedding. `` I think the old movie was really about class distinction,'' said director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Erman </PERSON> said in an interview. `` This movie is really about opportunities.'' This will be the third version of the <LOCATION> Stella </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> story, based on a novel by <PERSON> Olive </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> <PERSON> Prouty </PERSON>. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> made a 1925 silent film, starring <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersholt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He produced the King <PERSON> Vidor </PERSON> version in 1937 starring <PERSON> Stanwyck </PERSON>, who was nominated for an Academy Award. The <ORGANIZATION> Samuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goldwyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> held the rights. Now, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is co-producing the new movie with <ORGANIZATION> Touchstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, which has an exclusive arrangement with <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>. Touchstone will domestically distribute the movie, and <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON>'s company has international distribution. <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> traces the idea to remake the movie back to 1986. He said he did n't intend to get involved in a co-production but the chance to get <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> as the film's star was too good to pass up. `` She's really become a reason to redo the picture,'' he said. As for the script, <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> said that the original movie's reliance on the class system would n't totally work today but the emotional scenes still do Among the `` set pieces,'' as he called them, are the birthday party for the daughter to which nobody comes and the famous ending. He, and others involved in making the movie, say there's no doubt that some sort of class system still exists even if it is not as ironclad as in the earlier part of the century. The new version ranges from 1969 to the present. <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> plays a bartender in a small upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> town, who meets rich New Yorker <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> while he is a medical student in the area. She gets pregnant, he backs off, she brings up their daughter without any help. That, of course, is just the start. `` It's <PERSON> Bette </PERSON>'s picture all the way,'' said actor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON>. The `` trick of the plot'' is to show that <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> simply do n't belong together. `` So nobody's a bad guy,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said, taking a break from tuning fellow actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>'s guitar. `` They're having a great affair, but realistically marriage is not in the cards for them.'' As for the famous scene where <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> will be watching her daughter get married, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said, `` If anybody in this day and age can make that scene fly, she could. `` If it works, it'll be similar to ` Beaches,' _ a really good cry and the kind of story people really like going to the movies for.'' The burly <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, off from the smash hit television series `` Roseanne,'' is playing <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>'s oldest friend, hard-drinking <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Munn </PERSON>. `` I have to make it work for myself,'' he said when asked about the difficulties of updating the story. `` I ca n't think of what's gone on before. <PERSON> Erman </PERSON>, who directed such television movies as `` The Two Mrs. <PERSON> Grenvilles </PERSON>'' and `` An Early Frost,'' said the key update is that <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> choose not to be together. `` We've all worked very hard to make sure this is credible and plausible,'' he said. `` I frankly think that if you had done this with an actress who did n't have the range that <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> has, then it might seem more like a soap opera.''

 <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> has no illusions that the forestry program he supervises for young inmates will help all of them, but authorities say a little respect and some incentives can go a long way toward helping some. `` When you're at the bottom and have never had anything, anything is important to you,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. `` These boys come from a rough background. Some of them you're going to change, some of them you're not.'' Inmates who participate in the BRIDGE program range in age from 18 to 25 and learn such skills as carpentry, forestry, logging and fighting forest fires in the state's three mountain districts. BRIDGE is an acronym for Building, Rehabilitating, Instructing, Developing, Growing and Employing. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> credits the program's success to incentives. There's `` gain time'' _ for every eight hours a BRIDGE inmate works, a day is subtracted from his sentence. The inmates wear special uniforms with logging boots and get a break from prison food by eating at restaurants near worksites. At the program's administrative offices at the <ORGANIZATION> Burke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, there is a display of photographs of the participants, with the inmate of the month at the top. That's another incentive, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said, because some of the inmates have never had an 8-by-10 photograph of themselves. `` They're not Boy Scouts,'' added <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who directs the BRIDGE program from <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. `` They did something wrong. But if you treat them well, you get something back.'' The participants in <LOCATION> Avery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are constructing buildings that will house up to 50 inmates in the program. Pointing to five young inmates skimming the bark off a pine tree at a makeshift sawmill, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, a Division of Forest Resources project leader, said, `` That's a good crew right there. They actually hunt work to do.'' Nearby, several young men used hammers and handsaws to put the finishing touches on one of three buildings resembling vacation lodges that are perched on a hillside in the <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. Inmate <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who is serving a three-year sentence for breaking and entering, had never seen a sawmill before but took to the work quickly. `` It's a lot better than sitting around all day,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 22, who entered the program about four months ago and has about seven months left. `` They treat you just like you're at work.'' Some inmates are chosen to work on the `` helitack crew,'' which fights forest fires from a bright yellow <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopter equipped with a collapsible water bucket. While they're building the camp facilities, the program's 26 inmates are temporarily housed at the <ORGANIZATION> Burke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Instructors from nearby <ORGANIZATION> Mayland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> have provided training in carpentry and masonry, but no professional contractors have been hired. `` A lot of it we just beat and bang and learn ourselves,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Layman </PERSON>, director of the Division of <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, said the young prisoners have a chance to develop skills, such as carpentry and plumbing, and they are also attracted to the program because they are treated less like inmates. `` Our nicest compliment on the program was one young man gave up his parole to stay in the program,'' Layman said. `` The kids begin to feel part of something. We treat them with respect.'' Since the program was begun in 1986, it has taken in 206 inmates. About dozen have re-entered the prison system, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. Others have been hired by the state forestry division and private employers. The youths volunteer for the program and are carefully screened, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. Layman compared the program with the <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> begun by President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> during the Depression. `` It's using the forest as remedial,'' he said. `` There is something healing about taking them out in the woods and letting them work with nature. `` We cut down the logs, then build the camp ourselves with our forestry supervisors and the inmate labor,'' he said. Layman said the program was begun after a fire in <LOCATION> Burke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> destroyed 47 homes built on `` little switchback roads.'' He said it was born a union of the state's prison and forestry divisions. The program is one of just two east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, state forest officials said. The other is in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Modeled after similar programs in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the BRIDGE program uses only young, minimum-custody prisoners. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruton </PERSON>, 21, has been in the program 19 months. He has earned 674 hours of gain time _ enough for more than 2 -LCB- months off his sentence _ and has nearly completed a 13-year prison term for breaking and entering. `` You hear of forest fires on TV,'' said <PERSON> Bruton </PERSON>. `` They offered it to me, and I thought it would give me a change from regular prison.'' <PERSON> Bruton </PERSON> has learned carpentry, landscaping and the operation of heavy equipment, such as bulldozers and a `` knuckleboom loader'' used by the logging industry. He also spent 18 months on the helitack team. `` I've learned so much,'' he said. `` I did n't know nothing before I came in.''

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prison system is like a stopped up pipe. Built to contain a stream of criminals, the plumbing is overflowing. Spillover inmates end up in tents in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and on surplus troop barges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, POW-style camps may be built. Some states have installed jury-rigged emergency valves to free prisoners ahead of their time. But last year, when courts freed a wave of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> inmates, they committed a wave of new crimes. And 10 days after one <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prisoner got an early release he was charged with killing two cops. The states swamped the worst are trying to bail themselves out with new prison construction. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 70 percent over the brim, is spending $ 3.2 billion on building. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants an extra $ 1 billion in 1990 for federal prisons, which are 55 percent over capacity. Authorities say these vast amounts and desperate measures are not enough to ease the jam and the threat of riot that goes with it. They propose shorter sentences for non-violent criminals, and more use of work release, probation, restitution, halfway houses and electronically monitored house arrest. `` The entire system is filled beyond capacity. It's clogged,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Travisono </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's like trying to mop the bathroom floor without turning off the spigot on an overflowing bathtub,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnyman </PERSON>, a civil rights lawyer in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. Recent mandatory sentencing rules and a jump in drug-related prosecutions have packed prisons, officials said, but the flood of inmates is not new. This year was the 14th straight that opened with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prison population at an all-time high. The number imprisoned has nearly tripled since 1975. The 627,402 people behind bars at the start of this year were 60,504 more than the system was designed to hold, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Are the streets safer? `` There's not a criminologist or a sociologist in the country that can say as a result of more incarcerations we have lowered the crime rate,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoelter </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Institutions and Alternatives. `` We've been blackmailed by our fear of crime.'' If so, it's expensive blackmail. The annual tab for locking people up is $ 16 billion a year. In some places the $ 20,000 cost to imprison an inmate each year could send a student to <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, or pay a cop's salary. An average new prison costs $ 40 million. Last year, the system grew by 42,967 inmates, which translates to the need for 86 new prisons. States are building furiously. This year, $ 9 billion is being spent for construction. An additional $ 6 billion is on states' wish lists. But if the number stayed the same, and every projection says it will keep accelerating, it would take eight years just to build cells for all the inmates who need them, the <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. Even corrections officers say new prisons wo n't solve overcrowding. `` Nobody has been able to build their way out of the overcrowding problem. Once built, a prison bed will soon find an inmate,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Meachum </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. If all 24,000 beds that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to add to federal prisons were available immediately they would eliminate only the overflow; the 48,039-inmate system is 55 percent over capacity. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> may put prisoners in shelters for the homeless. Recently, 75 inmates at <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> slept in a single room with one toilet. The city is housing prisoners on two surplus ferryboats and two converted British troop barges. A five-story, 625-foot long floating jail is being built. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with the largest inmate population in the country at 80,721, is spending $ 3.2 billion on more space. It has built 21,000 new beds since 1984. Americans `` expect criminals to serve hard time, to suffer,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, professor of justice at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` They want these people off the streets, but they're not inclined to think through what it will cost.'' The cost could be another <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Soledad </LOCATION>, some officials warn. `` The potential for explosion is always there in an overcrowded prison,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sublett </PERSON>, president of the ACA. Thirty-five states, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> are under court order to relieve overcrowding; all but <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Twenty-seven have population caps set by federal courts. Until 1988, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> housed 1,046 inmates in 12-person tents. The state is building 9,376 new prison beds at a cost of $ 109 million. And to comply with a cap, the state has an early release program in which inmates serve only 35 percent of their sentence. One convict, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>, was accused of killing two <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police officers in November, 10 days after he was released from prison and served eight years of a 15-year sentence for attempted murder. `` The system is broken,'' said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we have now is a legal escape system. We just open the door for them.'' <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> prisons twice released inmates last year to meet a court order. Of 256 inmates released in June, 106 were arrested within six months and accused of 156 new crimes. `` That's 156 crimes that should n't have happened.'' said District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON>. `` We're sending a message to criminals that they're not going to jail here. You ca n't imagine how frustrating it is.'' Because of a court-ordered cap, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> closed its system to new inmates in April, the 31st time since 1987 the doors were shut. That just burdens county jails. One judge authorized <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to build POW-style camps that could be patrolled by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, parole was outlawed in 1981, and a 1984 state law mandates emergency release if the prison population is at 110 percent of capacity for 30 days. To avoid opening prison doors, the number of people in a parole-like program called supervised home release has increased from 700 to 3,400 in the last 18 months. Nine states have military-style boot camps where young felons trade their sentences for a few months of pre-dawn wakeups, pushups and hard labor under bombastic drill sergeants. Critics doubt the discipline will help and fear it might just make criminals meaner. Fifty overflow inmates from the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> were blamed for death threats, fires, food fights and sabotaged toilets after they arrived at a prison in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. Guards threatened to strike. Last week, 10 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison guards charged in a lawsuit that overcrowding was so severe their lives were in danger. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, too, has reason to worry. Her state spent $ 100 million in five years for 4,500 new prison beds and still pays $ 28,000 a day to house an overflow of 700 inmates in county jails. The money, she said, has `` begun to restrict the state's ability to educate our children, provide health care for the elderly, disabled and low-income citizens and fulfill other state obligations.''

<HEAD>Natural Crop Weapons Sought in War Against Nasty Old Pathogens</HEAD>

 If you sometimes think the daily grind is a dog-eat-dog world, you ought to see what goes on between the fungi and the pathogens. Of course, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, there are good fungi. But there are also bad fungi. Pathogens? They're the tiny things like viruses that cause diseases _ and they're mostly bad. The idea of using nature's own organisms to fight, hold back and destroy plant diseases has been around a long time. And the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the search continues for biological ways of protecting crops. Recent reports from the agency show the task to be slow and painstaking. Fungi and bacteria exist naturally in the same soil that nourishes corn, wheat, rice, cotton, soybeans and even backyard tomatoes. One of the tasks of the scientists is to sort out those organisms and choose through experiments the ones that can help protect crops. `` Twenty years from now, we'll have many more biological controls like fungi to use,'' says <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fravel </PERSON>, an agency plant pathologist. `` They may not be as common as chemicals, but they certainly will be increasingly important. I do n't think biological controls will ever completely replace chemicals, but they will help reduce the amount of chemicals used.'' Half a dozen beneficial fungi are being studied at the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Biocontrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diseases </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Fravel </PERSON> works Each is under scrutiny for its ability to fight pathogens such as the bad fungi, bacteria, microscopic worms called nematodes and even viruses. `` The idea is that we can enhance what's out there in nature,'' <PERSON> Fravel </PERSON> said. `` A lot of management practices in use right now, such as adding organic matter to the soil, actually are biocontrols because organic matter feeds the organisms already in place.'' Fungi used in biocontrol fight plant pathogens in several ways: parasitism, or actually feeding on the pathogen; antibiosis, or producing some sort of compound that is toxic to the pathogen; and through competition, the most common action. For example, she said, `` Plant roots leak carbon sources such as sugar. The biocontrol organisms get to those carbon sources before the pathogens do, so the pathogens ca n't get anything to eat and ca n't grow. Or the biocontrol organisms may simply occupy all the space around the root so the pathogen ca n't get in.'' <PERSON> Fravel </PERSON> and her colleagues are conducting tests in some <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> eggplant fields to see how well a beneficial fungus _ Talaromyces flavus _ fights <PERSON> Verticillium </PERSON> wilt disease. In previous field tests, the fungus in combination with a reduced amount of chemical fumigant reduced wilt disease in eggplant crops by as much as 75 percent. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a soil scientist at the <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION> laboratory, said work recently began on encasing two other fungi _ <LOCATION> Trichoderma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gliocladium </LOCATION> _ in pellets, which then are mixed into infected soil or potting material to test their effectiveness. `` The pellets contain food for the biocontrol fungi,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` The organism grows out of the pellet and spreads through the soil, where it attacks the pathogen and kills it.'' A number of other fungi also are being studied as possible weapons, including some that might be targeted against pathogens that help cause the rotting of seed and the seedlings of cotton, sugarbeets and many vegetables and ornamental plants. Still other fungi are being used experimentally against some of their bad relatives noted for causing stalk rot in corn. Plant pathologist <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vakili </PERSON>, who works at the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency's <ORGANIZATION> Cereal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, said the good fungi enter and live inside the corn plant, where they eat away at the rot fungi. <PERSON> Vakili </PERSON> sprayed spores of <LOCATION> Melanospora </LOCATION> damnosa on corn plants in test plots. In the first year, the beneficial fungus infected only about one-half of 1 percent of the stalk rot fungus, Fusarium moniliforme, in the stalks. But after five years, as the good fungus built up in the soil, 50 percent to 80 percent were infected. The results suggest that strains of biocontrol fungi could be selected for compatability with specific lines of corn, he said. The corn would be bred to support large numbers of the fungi organisms. `` In the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> alone, stalk rots reduce yields by some 500 million bushels annually,'' <PERSON> Vakili </PERSON> said. But fungi are not the only weapons being looked at by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientists. Chemist <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buyer </PERSON> and two colleagues have produced and tested a monoclonal antibody, a custom-built protein, that will seek out and fasten onto iron-hoarding compounds called siderophores. Virtually all bacteria and fungi, good and bad alike, produce siderophores to meet their own iron needs, <PERSON> Buyer </PERSON> said. Sometimes, but not always, these compounds help control pathogens. `` Right now, we have no good methods to study the compounds in their natural state or determine why they sometimes do and sometimes do n't help control disease organisms,'' Buyer said. The new antibody, which is headed for greenhouse tests this summer on roots of barley seedlings, hopefully will seek and bind to siderophores so they can be measured and studied more fully. Eventually, it may be possible for farmers and home gardeners to make bad microbes anemic by loading the soil with certain beneficial bacteria that will deprive the pathogens of their iron supply.

 <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> had one of your better supporting roles on TV as <PERSON> Newdell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s intimidating makeup man on `` Buffalo Bill.'' When the critically acclaimed comedy failed to reach a wide audience and was canceled by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> landed on his feet in yet another great supporting role, on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Night Court.'' `` ` Buffalo Bill' was a wonderful show,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` But unfortunately it did n't make it. I thought maybe my career was over. Then I heard I might go to ` Night Court.' Three days later I got the call.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> joined the `` Night Court'' cast in September 1984 when the show began its first full season. He has been with the hit comedy ever since as laid-back court clerk <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. The series features a parade of defendants through the unconventional night-time <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court session. It's sometimes difficult to separate the itinerant loonies from the officers of the court. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> stars as the hip judge, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Larroquette </PERSON> has won four Emmys as the licentious prosecutor, <ORGANIZATION> Markie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> is the perky defense attorney and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moll </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Warfield </PERSON> are the bailiffs. `` Mac's a more difficult character to play than <PERSON> Newdell </PERSON> was on ` Buffalo Bill,''' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` He's a wonderful guy, but it's hard to play a guy like that <PERSON> Newdell </PERSON> had all those colors, he was unpredictable. <PERSON> Newdell </PERSON> could show up in a dashiki. What do you dress Mac in? Khakis and a sweater. `` Mac's the normal person on the show. He stands back and observes the others. But he also participates in the craziness. He can say something that shocks me. He has better control than the others. I love playing Mac. It takes a lot of discipline. He's always on the verge He senses what's going on and can be touched by it. <PERSON> Newdell </PERSON> would step away, but <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> sees them as part of his family.'' `` Night Court'' is a variation on the concept of `` Barney Miller'' and was created by <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> <PERSON> Weege </PERSON>, a former producer of `` Barney <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>.'' The show had a tough shakedown and was not an immediate hit. It has also undergone a lot of cast changes. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Larroquette </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moll </PERSON> are the only members of the original cast. <PERSON> Selma </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> began as the caustic, wisecracking bailiff, and after her death from lung cancer in 1985 she was replaced by <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Halop </PERSON>. <PERSON> Halop </PERSON> also suffered from lung cancer. She died in 1986 and was replaced by <PERSON> Warfield </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> was the first court clerk and <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was the first defense attorney. `` They're taking Mac in a new direction,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` Mac has always wanted to be an attorney, and they're sending him back to school.'' Mac also got married on the show, to an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> woman named <PERSON> Quon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Denice </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumagai </PERSON>. `` I think a lot of it's based on my own life,'' he said. `` My wife is from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he organized a singing group called the <ORGANIZATION> Drells </ORGANIZATION> and worked in local theater. `` I always wanted to entertain,'' he said. `` When I was 5, I wanted to be a minister. Then I started singing with various groups. But after a while I got discouraged. I was n't thinking about acting, but I was watching television and saw <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> and said, ` I bet I can do that.''' He studied at a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> workshop, but felt he was n't getting anywhere and quit. `` <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the -LRB- workshop -RRB- director, called me and asked me to come back and I never quit again,'' he said. `` She gave me a scholarship. After about five years I moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.'' He also trained with <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>, a well-known <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> drama teacher and father of actress <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>. `` He challenged me,'' <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> said. `` When I was young my attitude was that I knew it all. He would see if I was n't giving my all. I'd drive home in tears. Finally, I decided to listen. He was so important to my career.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> worked on such shows as `` Hill Street Blues,'' `` St. Elsewhere,'' `` Columbo'' and `` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>.'' He was in `` Roots: The Next Generation,'' `` Rehearsal for Murder,'' `` Haywire,'' `` The Trial of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>,'' and such theatrical films as `` Gray Lady Down,'' `` Apocalypse Now,'' and `` The River.'' He was in a pilot based on the movie `` The Last Detail'' and another called `` Temporary Insanity.'' He also starred with <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> in a pilot called `` The Buffalo Soldiers,'' about black cavalry in the last century.

<HEAD>Most American Companies Reacting Cautiously to Chinese Turmoil</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies operating in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are reacting to the tumultuous political events there by delaying visits and telling expatriate workers to avoid street protests, but few are taking people out of the country. Most companies believe it's premature to even consider divestment or withdrawal, particularly because the protests are n't anti-foreign and violence has been rare But many were surprised at how quickly the government's seeming stability weakened because of the demonstrations for democratic reforms gripping <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` So much depends on what ultimately happens here,'' <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a lawyer and expert on doing business with the Chinese, said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residence. `` I'm still holding open the possibility that a new surge of modernization, a more open <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, could come out of this,'' he said. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based association of American companies with interests in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said business requests for information have multiplied to 50 or 60 daily since the crisis intensified, vs. two or three a day ordinarily. But <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he knew of no companies that were rethinking their long-term plans in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` There's a lot of hand-wringing going on. But companies are intelligent enough not to make decisions in that environment,'' he said. `` Companies do n't react to something like this until they see the longer-term implications.'' The unprecedented demonstrations come against a background of broadening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business operations in the world's most populous country, with ventures as ranging from open-pit coal mining to nuclear power. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a leading foreign investor in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and one of its most important trading partners. More than 600 U.S.-Chinese joint ventures have been established since the countries normalized relations a decade ago. Telephone interviews Tuesday with business consultants and executives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> suggested many visits to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had been delayed until the political crisis stabilizes. Most postponements were attributed to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> travel advisory and uncertainty over whether the demonstrations would turn violent. `` Everybody is just tentatively rescheduling things,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Some companies also curtailed <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> operations. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, closed its office temporarily over the weekend and offered its 27 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> staffers the option of sending family members out. Spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallerstein </PERSON> said it was unclear whether any had left. `` We've closed the office just because we do n't want our people coming in to work in light of that situation,'' he said. `` We've also asked them to stay in their residences as much as possible, avoid public gatherings and not carry cameras around with them. Among other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies with offices in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said three expatriate employees temporarily had left the country and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said one had, partly because the protests paralyzed traffic in much of the capital, making ordinary work nearly impossible. `` It's really not business as usual there,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>. `` So we sent our three non-Chinese employees to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> on a temporary basis, until normal business conditions return to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.'' Others _ including <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s jeep joint-venture _ were said by sources in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to have evacuated an undetermined number of staffers and dependents. But spokesmen for those companies said they were unaware anyone had left due to the crisis. Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said the computer giant's 50 expatriates in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were taking what he described as prudent precautions `` We just make sure the employees are using good sense,'' he said. `` If you ca n't get to work, do n't come to work.'' <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Torbert </PERSON>, a partner and Chinese legal expert at the Chicago-based law firm <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, which has offices in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said he was unaware of any clients withdrawing plans for investment or business negotiations. <PERSON> Torbert </PERSON> also said many business representatives in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were rooting privately for the protesters' cause of greater freedom and democracy. `` In fact, people are excited to be there,'' he said. `` It's such an exciting moment What are you going to tell your grandchildren, that you left?''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> once could count herself among <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s most powerful women, the only female casino president in this oceanside gaming resort. But the president of <ORGANIZATION> Elsinore </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> lost her status as she presided over the demise of the financially troubled casino. `` Everybody liked her quite a while ago. She seemed like she was working toward everyone's benefit,'' pit clerk <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, one of more than 1,200 laid-off casino employees, said Tuesday on his way to the unemployment office. `` Everyone used to be fairly well impressed with her intentions, but in hindsight, everything she did was bad,'' he said. The state <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Monday closed the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>, which had run up $ 150 million in debts. Regulators are considering a bid by developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to buy the Atlantis for $ 63 million and convert it into a luxury non-casino hotel. About 600 hotel and restaurant employees still on the Atlantis payroll are anxiously watching the outcome of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s purchase agreement, which is being challenged by the casino's state-appointed conservator Mrs. Hood was n't around for the casino's final day of gaming on Sunday, her 63rd birthday. Atlantis spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrow </PERSON> said Tuesday that Mrs. Hood is in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Repeated attempts to reach her directly or through a spokesman were unsuccessful. During the casino's chaotic final two years, Mrs. <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> was a study in contrasts. She dressed elegantly, but said she drove to the local mall in a <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> she kept in the Atlantis parking garage. During an employee strike in 1987, pickets chanted `` <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, she's no good'' while faithful workers talked with reporters inside about her loyalty to the company. And though her fondest dream was to see news reports stop referring to the Atlantis as the `` financially struggling casino,'' Mrs. Hood failed to accomplish just that. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON>, a gaming analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said strained relations between Mrs. Hood and workers often were reflected in the treatment of customers. `` Their level of tips was at half the level of the other houses, but a lot of them stayed because they could not get similar jobs in other casinos. Most casino jobs in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> today are entry-level,'' he said. In Mrs. Hood's defense, <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said she inherited an ill-designed and ill-managed casino from her arrival in late 1985. The three-level casino floor was never popular with customers, and the Atlantis is burdened with a heavy debt structure. The Atlantis also failed at a marketing campaign aimed at middle-class customers that steered away from high-rollers who pump money into gaming halls. Mrs. Hood succeeded her husband <PERSON> David </PERSON> as president of the Four Queens Casino Hotel in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, which also is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Elsinore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, after his death in 1977. She has said the promotion was a matter of convenience as employees accepted her as readily as her popular spouse. Mrs. <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> added the job of president of <ORGANIZATION> Elsinore </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> operations eight years later when the president quit. A month after her arrival, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a former partner that was owed money on a promissory note, filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the Atlantis. The casino promptly filed for bankruptcy itself, seeking protection from its 15,000 creditors. Mrs. Hood has candidly admitted she had no idea what bankruptcy meant at the time. In the ensuing years, Mrs. Hood lived full-time at the Atlantis, returning to her <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> home occasionally for family visits. `` I have the touch and feel of the property,'' she said in a 1988 interview. `` I have my arms around it.'' But in the casino's final weeks, Mrs. Hood could only watch as the state handed control to a conservator and then ordered the Atlantis closed. On one of her final walks through the casino, many employees called her unflattering names. Mrs. Hood reacted by smiling and waving.

<HEAD>Dukakis Unveils Anti-Takeover Legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has proposed erecting some of the nation's toughest barriers to hostile takeovers in an effort to protect the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle from corporate raiders. The former Democratic presidential candidate said Tuesday the barriers would include mandatory severance pay for workers laid off during takeover battles and a higher percentage of share ownership required for control. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he hoped the package would inspire similar measures across the nation. He had called for anti-takeover action during last year's presidential campaign. `` In the absence of federal action ... the states have got to move _ and we're going to move,'' he said. The governor outlined the legislation in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>'s Technology Square, outside the headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which recently staved off a $ 3.1 billion hostile bid from <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s experience helped shape the bill The instant photography company, which is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, made use of a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law that bars completion of a takeover for three years unless the raider either gets approval of the target company or buys 85 percent of its stock. By placing millions of its shares in friendly hands through an employee stock ownership plan, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> made it virtually impossible for <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> to reach the 85 percent level. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law would go further, raising the threshold to 90 percent. The law would also be triggered earlier _ delaying a takeover as soon as a hostile bidder acquires 5 percent of a public company's stock, rather than 15 percent, as in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. The bill was drafted by a 27-member commission appointed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and including labor leaders, corporate executives, lawyers and legislators. Some provisions, such as the severance pay, are expected to draw opposition from business lobbyists. Merger specialists also predicted that the 5 percent threshold would be challenged in court as an unconstitutional intrusion on federal authority over interstate commerce. `` It's an admirable effort, but the question is going to come down to state regulation versus federal regulation, and I think there's going to be a lot of debate about it,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, a partner in the law firm of <LOCATION> Skadden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arps </LOCATION>, Slate, <ORGANIZATION> Meagher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Flom. `` They're going to be in and out of court.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> maintained the legislation was not designed to ban all takeovers, or even all hostile takeovers. Rather, he said, `` the aim is to force takeover artists to be socially responsible'' and block them from buying companies, laying off workers and then selling the companies piecemeal at big profits. Among the legislation's provisions is a requirement that an acquiring company assume all of the takeover target's labor contracts. In addition, boards of directors would be given explicit permission to consider the interests of employees, customers and communities in deciding whether to reject a takeover offer. That would help insulate directors from lawsuits by shareholders who favor selling out quickly for the highest price. From the time a raider acquires 5 percent of a company's stock until two years after the takeover is completed, all employees who are laid off without good cause would be entitled to two weeks severance pay for each year they had been employed. Also, the legislation would make it easier for corporations to set up shareholder rights plans, or `` poison pill'' defenses, which boost the price of a takeover by giving shareholders an automatic right to buy additional shares. Proponents of the takeovers that have reshaped corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the 1980s contend that hostile bids have shaken up entrenched managers and forced companies to pay more attention to providing a good return to stockholders. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> the most common takeover targets are not weak companies, but well-run firms whose stock is undervalued because executives focus on long-term opportunities not quarterly profits. `` It's our best corporate citizens that are being attacked _ it's the Polaroids, the Primes, the Gillettes, the Stop' n' Shops,'' he said, referring to a string of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> companies that have faced takeover battles in recent years

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is n't taking seriously a statement by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> man who says he heads a group formulating a proposal to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> simultaneously for $ 4.9 billion. The printed statement released in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday said a company called <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was in the final stages of creating an investor group that might bid up to $ 130 a share for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> and up to $ 7 per share for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> for the $ 4.9 billion total. In addition, the company would acquire up to 300 new aircraft for more than $ 22 billion, the statement said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, who was identified as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION>, declined to elaborate but said in a telephone interview that the announcement was not a hoax. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> has shown previous interest in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> but has not made a legitimate bid. `` He never has been able to demonstrate any financial support and in view of that history we would not view this proposal as being credible either,'' <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, has been contacted by <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> but has not received a bid from him, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON>, a spokesman for the nation's fourth-largest carrier. To limit the impact of the Trans Global announcement and provide time for traders to review it, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> halted trading in shares of the two airlines for about 25 minutes Tuesday afternoon. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON> later termed <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s news release as appearing `` somewhat less than credible.'' <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock closed up $ 2.12 -LCB- at $ 106 a share. Pan Am rose 37 -LCB- cents to $ 4.75. The Trans Global statement said further information could be forthcoming by next week, but did not indicate who would finance the plan. The statement said a `` major Wall Street investment banking firm and a major domestic banking institution had indicated an interest in participating'' in the joint bid. But <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> declined to identify the institutions and would not provide details about himself when questioned by telephone. The news release described Trans Global as a `` privately held New York-based holding company.'' The release said a former senior official of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, who was not identified, had expressed interest in acting as the group's legal adviser. It also stated the bid would include up to $ 600 million of equity and would not result in the breakup of either airline. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, which has been a takeover target since late March, has invited interested buyers to submit bids by May 30. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> announced May 9 that it might submit an offer, but it was continuing to seek financing. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, an airline industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said he never had heard of Trans Global. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, said he had no information on the Trans Global bid. `` There's a lot of little outfits coming out of the woodwork here to try to get their moment in the sun,'' <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- Trans Global -RRB- could be the sultan of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> for all we know.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> claims that federal regulators unfairly thwarted the savings and loan company's plan to leave the thrift industry's federal insurance fund The widely watched tussle between the large thrift and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> demonstrates the anger felt by managers of healthy S & amp; Ls who blame sloppy or dishonest rivals for the present crisis in the fund that insures customers' deposits. Great Western, the nation's third-biggest thrift, stands to lose $ 20 million this year because of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> ruling. That amount is the difference in the cost of coverage by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ the fund for banks. Great Western filed suit against the government in federal court Tuesday, one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> rejected its proposal to merge two subsidiaries in a deal that would, in effect, take the company's big <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> operation out of the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. The suit calls the decision `` arbitrary and capricious'' and contends Great Western met the legal requirements for changing insurance funds. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s erroneous refusal to approve the application unjustifiably imprisons <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> within the ailing <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> system,'' the company said in announcing the suit. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said officials had expected the suit, and stood by their decision. Great Western Financial, a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills-based </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L holding company, sought to merge its <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, into another subsidiary, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> -LRB- Despite the use of bank in the names, both institutions are chartered as savings and loans. -RRB- The <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> institution already has fled the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> S & amp; L is barred from such a switch by state law, but by merging into the smaller <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> institution would be able to change insurance funds. Great Western Financial, with $ 35 billion in assets, has 280 retail <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L branches in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Its chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, has been outspoken in his belief that healthy thrifts are being unfairly tapped to make up losses incurred by the one-third of the industry that is in trouble. The <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> is strapped by a wave of failures and federally forced mergers among thrifts pummeled by failing real estate markets in some states and, according to some critics, by fraud and mismanagement that regulators overlooked. <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> insurance, which once cost about the same as <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> insurance for banks, has nearly doubled in price because of surcharges imposed to replenish the fund because of the wave of failures and mergers. In order to preserve the insurance fund, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 imposed a moratorium on departures from the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. But Great Western is among some 30 thrifts that could qualify for exemptions to the moratorium because they stated an intent to leave the fund before the moratorium was approved. Among those thrifts that have applied to leave the fund is the nation's biggest thrift-holding company, <ORGANIZATION> H.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahmanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, parent of Home Savings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 In the latest crackdown on penny stock fraud, four former employees of a defunct brokerage have pleaded guilty in connection with a scheme prosecutors say bilked customers nationwide of $ 67 million. `` These are not mere technical violations of securities laws,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` They were blatant frauds that cost investors millions of dollars.'' The Paramus-based company, F.D. <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, systematically manipulated stock prices that bilked thousands of customers across the country, <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. Before declaring bankruptcy last February, the company also had offices in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, F.D. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' former national sales manager, admitted in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here to conspiring with other top management at the firm to use dozens of fraudulent techniques to sell the stocks. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $ 1 million. He specifically pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and three counts of securities fraud. Also pleading guilty to related charges were <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisen </PERSON>, the former manager of the firm, and <PERSON> Pamella </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON>, a broker, both of <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Siesser </PERSON>, a broker, of <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eisen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> pleaded guilty to one count each of securities fraud <PERSON> Seisser </PERSON> pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud. All face maximum sentnces of five years in prison and fines of $ 250,000. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Politan </PERSON> will sentence them Aug. 22. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said the first step in the scheme was for F.D. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> to locate or create companies, which usually existed only on paper and had few or no assets. The companies would then make an initial public offering of the stock. F.D. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> would then purchase the stock in nominee accounts that its officals referred to as `` dirt-bag'' accounts, <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. F.D. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' stockbrokers would then conceal their ownership in the accounts while they touted and sold the securities at inflated prices, <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said and <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> admitted in court. The sales manager hired a young, inexperienced sales staff with little or no training in securities. The employees used high-pressure, badgering telephone sales techniques to sell the stock. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said up to 250 of the brokers worked at any given time, some of them making up to $ 250,000 a year. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said he would seek restitution for the investors, but he added officials are not sure where all the money generated by the F.D. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> is.

<TEXT>
 Debt-laden <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to sell its largest insurance subsidiary for $ 135.5 million as it pares down its holdings and looks for cash. <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>, which is in violation of agreements with holders of about $ 1.1 billion in bonds, said Tuesday it had reached agreement in principle to sell its 89 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5.21 a share to a partnership of <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION>'s other stockholders will receive no less than $ 22.72 million, or $ 7 a share, for their holdings under the agreement. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> also will receive $ 30 million in preferred stock in exchange for the $ 35 million in preferred stock it currently holds in <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> has been shopping <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and its other insurance holdings since January when its two top officers were ousted by outside directors. `` The proposed sale of <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION> is another step in our efforts to downsize <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> through selective asset sales,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, brought in to run the company after Chairman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> were forced out. <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiter </PERSON> said the sale will help the company's cash flow, but will not bring it into compliance with net worth provisions of the outstanding bonds. <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> said two weeks ago stockholders' equity had fallen from $ 701 million on June 30, 1988 to a negative $ 428 million on March 31. Although the change opens the door for creditors to begin proceedings to force <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy, they have not done so and <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> says it can continue to pay interest on the bonds for some time. The sale is subject to further discussions among the parties, including obtaining fairness opinions and regulatory board approval of the various companies. <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION>, with assets of more than $ 1.4 billion, last week reported first-quarter income of $ 4.89 million, compared with last year's $ 580 million loss in the first quarter. The company markets a diversified line of life insurance and annuity products, especially property and casualty insurance and private mortgage insurance through nine subsidiaries. Although most operations are in the Southeast, it is licensed in 47 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The sale also comes in the midst of a bitter fight for control of <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>, which two weeks ago announced a $ 1.04 billion quarterly loss due primarily to an $ 829 million writedown of its real estate assets. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, developer and real estate investor, is leading a proxy fight to win three seats on <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>'s seven-member board of directors.

 Steelmakers are trying hard not to look prosperous as they wait for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to unveil his plan for extending restraints on steel imports. Prices are up, but not as high as they were when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> established five-year quotas on steel imports in late 1984, domestic producers say as they gather in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for their annual meeting starting today. Supplies of certain products are tight, but not because of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Voluntary Restraint Agreements. The market is working as it should, they say. `` And they probably made $ 3 billion last year, so it's kind of hard to claim injury,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, steel analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. `` Under the trade rules, they have to be injured'' by imports to get trade protection, he said. `` They have a real problem,'' <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said. `` But since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised, you'd better believe they are going to get it.'' An extension of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s VRAs was a last-minute campaign promise by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and during their meeting steel executives are expected to call on the president to fulfill his pledge promptly. Legislation enabling the president to enter another round of quota agreements with steel-producing nations has 57 co-sponsors in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, nearly twice the number who sponsored the 1984 quota bill. The American Iron and <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> counts 231 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members as co-sponsors. With the broad support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for renewal of VRAs, the industry's big questions concern the duration and strength of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> program, not whether there will be another round of quotas. Among options being discussed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is a two-year version of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s five-year plan. Another option is a four-year plan that would relax restraints on individual countries as they eliminate unfair trade practices, according to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryers </PERSON>, legislative director for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa. No version has emerged as the most popular <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to unveil his quota plan as early as June. There is little debate that the industry has healed during the last 4 -LCB- years, although some authorities argue the turnaround was less the result of import quotas as of industry streamlining, equipment upgrading and the weakening of the dollar. Average employment edged higher by about 6,000 jobs to 168,900 workers in 1988, the first yearly increase since 1979, according to the American Iron and <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Following losses of $ 12 billion from 1982 to 1986, the industry had operating profits of $ 1 billion in 1987 and $ 3 billion in 1988. Exports are rising, reviving an outlet that was largely closed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers for much of the 1980s. The improvement is largely a result of a swing in the value of the dollar compared with other currencies. When the dollar was strong against other currencies, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods were more expensive overseas and imports were cheaper in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the second-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer, this month agreed to raise wages and benefits in a tentative agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> that is being criticized on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> as too generous.

<HEAD>Government Pushes Interest Rates Up 1 Point to 14 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government, in its continuing fight against resurgent inflation, today pushed up interest rates a full percentage point to 14 percent, the highest level in more than four years. Weakness in the British pound triggered the increase, the first since November. The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> signaled the rise in British commercial banks' base lending rate by announcing it was raising its own money market rate to 14 percent, effective today. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s four major commercial banks, <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> LLoyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, responded by raising their base rate one point to that level. After its announcement, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> underlined its support for the pound by intervening against the dollar, foreign exchange dealers said. Both moves helped lift sterling about one cent against the dollar but the pound quickly fell back from highs reached immediately after the rate announcement. The pound stood at $ 1.5665 at late morning in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, down from a high of $ 1.5750 after the rate increase, but up from $ 1.5645 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> late Tuesday. Stock prices fell sharply on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index fell 26.2 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,125.4, by late morning. The government was `` obviously reacting because it is concerned about the fall in the pound,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, an economist at <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, repeated that high interest rates were necessary to bring down inflation, which is running at an annual rate of 8 percent, compared with 3.9 percent a year ago. She said that while the effects of high interest rates might be uncomfortable, continued high inflation would be worse. A <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official, who was n't identified in accordance with British practice, said the government `` has always made it clear that we will take no risks with inflation.'' He said that while consumer demand is slowing, the government could n't ignore the fall in the currency. Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s top official, has repeatedly stated over the past few months that the government was prepared to defend sterling because a decline in the currency would increase inflationary pressures. The 8 percent annual inflation rate for April raised expectations that inflation would climb higher, rather than peak at that level, as <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> had forecast in March. Some analysts have said that the government might raise interest rates as far as 15 percent before they come back down again. The interest rate rise might not be passed on to mortgage holders this time. Officials from building societies, which are the major lenders of mortgage money in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, have indicated recently that they might hold off on increasing mortgage rates, especially if they view a base rate rise as a short-term measure. Mortgage rates were last increased in January to between 13.5 percent and 14.2 percent. Building societies, flush with funds, are n't keen to suppress the mortgage market, which has already been depressed by previous rate rises. The last time interest rates stood at 14 percent was in March 1985. The interest rate increase was the 10th since June, when the base rate stood at 7.5 percent, a decade low. The commercial banks' corporate customers can obtain loans at one percentage point above the base rate.

<HEAD>London Shares Fall Sharply, But Off Lows By Midday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices were sharply lower but recovering from an earlier plunge by midday Wednesday as the bearish effect of a rise in British interest rates was offset by indications economic growth has slowed. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 26.7 points, or 1.2 percent, at 2,124.9, by about 12:15 p.m. in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It was above the morning low of 33.3 points down, which came a few minutes after the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> signaled a rise in base rates to 14 percent from 13 percent. The central bank prompted the interest rate hike after the recent plunge in the pound started to threaten the British government's anti-inflationary strategy. But the late-morning news that British retail sales volume fell a surprising 1.4 percent in April gave some comfort to the market, suggesting that previous measures to slow the economy were having the desired effect. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, an equity analyst at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, said 14 percent base rates probably would be sufficient to counter inflation, without denting corporate profits too much. `` This will be the final turn of the screw,'' <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said. Volume came to 306.9 million shares by midday, compared with 245 million shares at the same time Tuesday.

<HEAD>Aetna to Resume Writing New Policies Following Prop. 103 Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> officials say the company will resume writing new property and casualty insurance policies in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The announcement follows a moratorium on new policies that began after the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld most of Proposition 103 two weeks ago. The Hartford-based insurance company reversed itself because the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> is interpreting the measure in a way `` consistent with the court ruling, which clearly permits a fair return on our business and permits us to petition for relief from Proposition 103 rate rollbacks,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> was the only insurer to stop writing new policies after the court ruling. It continued to renew policies of existing customers. The court ruled that the 20 percent rate rollback imposed by Proposition 103 is constitutional but it said insurers must first be allowed to earn a `` fair return'' on their investments. The Department of Insurance has since issued a detailed form that insurers must complete by June 3 if they want to be exempted from the rate cut. Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Roxani </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> has promised that decisions will be made by November. <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> is the ninth-largest property and casualty insurer in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Auto insurance makes up a small portion of the company's business.

<HEAD>OPEC President: Increase Output If $18 Benchmark Desired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> president said an increase in the cartel's output is needed if members want to maintain an $ 18-per-barrel benchmark price through 1989, according to an interview published Wednesday. `` If we wish to maintain the current level until the end of the year, then we must increase the production quotas,'' said <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> in an interview published in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> weekly magazine al-Yamamah. The ministerial council of the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> holds its biannual meeting June 5 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to consider production and pricing policy for the July to December period. The cartel's 18.5 million barrel-per-day production ceiling for the first six months of the year has been largely responsible for arresting a downslide in prices and raising them beyond <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s targeted $ 18 price At times, the price has overshot that level by $ 2 to $ 3, though oil industry analysts also attribute this hike to major oil accidents in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, who is also <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s oil minister, referred to demand by some <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members for an increase in the overall quota between one and 1.5 million barrels per day. `` We want a moderate and gradual increase in prices, not a sudden one, and we therefore have to study the market to decide on the best production level for the second half of the year,'' he said. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> should have a `` moving ceiling'' which it can raise or lower to maintain the price levels it sought. But he also noted that in case output had to be considerably hiked, it would only be the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member states with high reserves and production capability that could accommodate such demand. He listed in this respect <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Producers outside the cartel could harm the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> price system if they did not cooperate on output levels, he said. `` We definitely need assurances from them that they will cooperate with us and work together with us, not doing anything that would harm the market,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has been given a deadline to line up financing commitments for its proposed $ 415 million purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION>'s lucrative Northeast shuttle or see its offer fail. Eastern on Tuesday gave <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> until 5 p.m. today to arrange the financing or <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would treat the offer as withdrawn. Strikebound Eastern already has agreed to a $ 365 million offer for the shuttle from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. Eastern attorney <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> announced the deadline during an abbreviated hearing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>. All parties in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy case _ including the airline's unions and creditors _ were expected to discuss the competing offers for the <LOCATION> Washington-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Boston </LOCATION> shuttle But Tuesday's court session lasted 20 minutes, and followed a brief hearing Monday when <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> still had questions about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>'s financing for the shuttle purchase. The parties were to return to court Thursday morning. If <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> has arranged its financing commitments by this afternoon's deadline, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> must determine whether they are satisfactory before both offers for the shuttle are considered further <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> must approve any sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets. <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> also must win approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> as a tenant at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s board of governors is scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon. If <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is unable to line up financing, the parties will consider only the Trump offer, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> expires at midnight Friday and he said Monday he would not raise his bid or extend the offer past the deadline. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, is offering Eastern $ 415 million for the shuttle and $ 336 million for 10 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757s. Alternatively, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> would buy only the shuttle's gates and landing slots in the three airports for $ 375 million, without 21 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s that are included in Trump's deal. The 21 727s, which are older than the 757s, have an estimated value of up to $ 80 million. Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors after the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union struck the airline March 4. Pilots and flight attendants are honoring the walkout, forcing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to cut back its flight schedule by 90 percent. Two investor groups, one headed by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> and the other led by former <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, have submitted formal bids for the entire airline. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday indicated it had contacted <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to express its interest in buying certain properties, including facilities at the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> airport and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> routes from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. The unions want the airline sold as one entity. But <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, wants to sell $ 1.8 billion of the airline's assets and operate as a smaller carrier. Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said today in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> the carrier must become streamlined before it can be saved, and said pilots who walked out in sympathy with striking Machinists may not have jobs when the airline recovers. Bakes told a group of travel industry representatives that while there are no plans to liquidate <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the airline would need to part with the $ 1.8 billion in assets to become financially solvent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Wednesday it had notified dealers to offer <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> buyers $ 1,000 rebates to fight a move by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on its Cadillac luxury cars. The incentive `` is purely a competitive action,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON> said. The offer, the first time <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has had rebates on the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, took effect last week. The company has a 56-day supply of Continentals on hand, which is not unusual, he added. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has been offering $ 1,000 or $ 2,000 rebates on some of Cadillacs since May 17. Those incentives expire May 31, a week before other <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> offers run out. The <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> rebates continue indefinitely, while other <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> incentives expire at month's end. Other incentives give buyers the choice of cash or low-interest financing. Meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also said Wednesday that rebates for some of its smaller cars, including the Ford Escort and Festiva and the Mercury Tracer, will be increased by at least $ 100 each.

<HEAD>British Pharmaceutical Company Posts 19 Percent Profit Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a major British pharmaceutical company, Wednesday reported a 19 percent profit increase for its fiscal year, with the best growth coming from prescription drugs. <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>, which has proposed merging with <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said its after-tax profit for the 12 months ended March 31 came to 301 million pounds, or about $ 473 million, up from 252 million pounds, or $ 396 million, in the prior year. Earnings per share were 39.73 pence, or 62 cents, and 33.34 pence, or 52 cents, in the same respective years. Revenue grew 1 percent to 2.51 billion pounds, or $ 3.94 billion, from the prior year's 2.48 billion pounds, or $ 3.89 billion. The earnings results coincided with <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>'s mailing to its shareholders of the formal document setting out the terms of its merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>. The merger, on which <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> shareholders are to vote June 20, would create a combined company with annual sales of more than $ 6.7 billion, ranking it second only to <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> among world pharmaceutical companies. <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> said prescription drugs contributed strongly to its profit, with the best growth coming from sales of newer, higher margin products such as the antibiotics Augmentin and <PERSON> Timentin </PERSON>. But sales of Amoxil, <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>'s long-standing antibiotic which is facing generic drug competition, were flat. <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON> did n't break out results for its fourth quarter or the second half of its fiscal year. It is n't required to do so under British law.

<HEAD>British Government Pushes Interest Rates to Four-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government raised interest rates by a full percentage point Wednesday, hiking them to a four-year high in a counterattack against newly resurgent inflation that has been worsened by a drop in the British pound. The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> signaled the change by raising its base lending rate to 14 percent, and major commercial banks responded by boosting their prime lending rates one point to that level. It was the 10th increase since last June, when rates stood at a decade low of 7.5 percent, but economists called the latest action particularly meaningful. The last time interest rates stood at 14 percent was in March 1985. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government has sought to curb an annual inflation rate which has moved up to 8 percent in April, compared with 3.9 percent a year earlier <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Capel </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday's rate hike is `` an important statement that the government is not going to accommodate any inflationary pressures growing in the economy.'' After announcing the increase, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> also intervened in the foreign exchange market by selling dollars for pounds, underscoring its support for the British currency, dealers said. Both moves helped lift sterling about one cent against the dollar but it quickly fell back from highs reached immediately after the rate announcement. The pound closed at $ 1.5695 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, up from $ 1.5675 dollarslate Tuesday. Prices fell sharply on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 18.9 points at 2,132.7. But shares were off their lows on news that British retail sales volume fell an unexpected 1.4 percent in April, providing evidence that the previous interest rate rises were having some effect of curbing strong consumer spending. A <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official, who was n't identified in accordance with British practice, said that while consumer demand was slowing the government could n't ignore the fall in the currency. A weaker pound fuels inflation by making imports more expensive. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said that while the effects of high interest rates might be uncomfortable, continued high inflation would be worse Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s top official, said in a radio interview: `` Overheating is on the way to subsiding. It is only a matter of time before inflation is coming down.'' But opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> attacked the government's move, saying the higher interest rates could broaden the country's trade deficit, which stood at $ 2.7 billion in March. Economists predict the British economy will grow between 2.5 percent and 2.8 percent this year, vs. 3.8 percent in 1988.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose Wednesday against all key currencies except the British pound in nervous European trading. Gold prices fell. Currency dealers said the dollar steadied in late trading after fluctuating over a broad range throughout the day. After concerted central bank intervention Tuesday and overnight dollar-selling by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, no central bank besides the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> was sighted in the European open market Wednesday. `` It's been very confusing today,'' said a trader at a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` It's been up and down, up and down. It's hard to figure what's going on.'' The British pound, which has lost 14 percent in value against the dollar this year, edged up to $ 1.5695 from $ 1.5675 late Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> hiked the base lending rates from 13 percent to a four-year high of 14 percent. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 1.05 Japanese yen to a closing 143.00 yen, a 19-month high. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it eased to 142.78 yen. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Tuesday: 2.0115 West German marks, up from 2.0079; 1.7887 Swiss francs, up from 1.7820; 6.8250 French francs, up from 6.7865; 2.2670 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2570; 1,455.75 Italian lire, up from 1,451.50; and 1.1985 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1975. Gold bullion fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 362.75 a troy ounce from $ 364.25 bid late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold fell to $ 362.60 an ounce from $ 364.25 bid late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose five cents to a closing bid of $ 364.02 an ounce. Silver bullion lost most of Tuesday's gains, dropping to $ 5.18 a troy ounce from $ 5.26.

 Share prices fell sharply Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following a rise in key British lending rates. But the market finished near its highest levels of the day as the pound strengthened and traders speculated that Thursday's British trade report would n't bring any bearish surprises The <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index fell 18.9 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 2,132.7, slightly below its best level of the day.

British banks raised their base lending rates by 1 percentage point to 14 percent. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index fell 13.4 points to 1,774.0, and the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index fell 9.68 points to close at 1,214.97. Volume fell to 468.3 million shares from Tuesday's 557.5 million shares. The rise in British interest rates came after the recent plunge in the pound had started to threaten the British government's anti-inflationary strategy The 100-share index has lost 72 points, or 3.3 perent, since the beginning of the week on worries that rates were about to go higher. `` The currency markets have really forced it -LRB- the rate rise -RRB- upon us,'' one <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equities dealer said. The market found some comfort, however, in news that British retail sales volume fell an unexpected 1.4 percent in April, suggesting that previous measures to slow down the economy were already having the desired effect.

<TEXT>
 With Republicans taking the lead, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted today to cut by half the increased civil penalties that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to impose on fraudulent savings and loan operators and embezzlers. Voting 17-14, the committee adopted an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, to reduce the proposed new civil penalties to $ 500,000 for each violation and to a maximum of $ 2.5 million against any one individual. As part of his $ 90 billion S & amp; L bailout package, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had sought to raise the civil penalties for defrauding banks, thrifts and other financial institutions backed by federal deposit insurance from the current maximum of $ 5,000 to $ 1 million for each violation. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said his amendment, which was backed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> but opposed by the administration, was intended to make the civil penalties `` remedial rather than punitive.'' Opponents, however, said the effect will be to reduce the government's ability to recover billions of dollars in federal deposit insurance funds that might be lost in the future to insider loans, fraud and embezzlement _ the major contibutors to the current S & amp; L crisis. `` The taxpayers are going to have to fork up $ 300 billion because of a bunch of high rollers,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON>, D-Ky. He referred to the interest costs over the 30 years for the taxpayer share of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bailout plan. `` I do n't think we should be worrying about remedializing them,'' <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> said of fraudulent S & amp; L operators. `` We should worry about punishing them.'' Five of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s 21 Democrats, including <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, and 12 of its 14 Republicans supported the amendment. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got all he wanted and more from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in seeking to make S & amp; L owners put more of their own money at risk, he faced new opposition to that as well today from members of his own party. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., said he would offer an amendment today before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> make </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators go through lengthy hearings before making thrift operators put up billions of dollars in new capital <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s No. 2 official at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s measure `` a grave error.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, approved by both the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, would raise from the current five years to 20 years the maximum sentence for bank and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L fraud and embezzlement. The maximum fine would rise from $ 5,000 to $ 1 million. Fraud has been blamed by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, regulatory officials and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as the single biggest contributor to what has become the nation's largest financial crisis since the Depression. The legislation is the price the administration is demanding for a $ 90 billion bailout of the industry. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> jumped into the fray Tuesday, asking <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders in a letter `` to hold absolutely firm against any attempt to weaken those vital elements ... which protect the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer from additional costs.'' `` Now is the time for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to act,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in identical letters to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, Democratic Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> GOP Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` Bipartisan majorities in both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> have defeated determined special interest lobbying against the tough capital standards needed to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayers from a repeat of this tragedy,'' he said. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> denied his measure is an attempt to weaken the capital standards adopted earlier this month by the banking committee. `` We're not touching the capital requirements at all,'' he said. `` An effort will be made to provide for hearings under the Administrative Procedures Act so that S & amp; Ls affected by the new capital structure requirements will have an opportunity to get due process.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., a member of both the judiciary and banking committees, described the proposal as a `` back-door attempt to undercut the ability of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> to enforce the capital standards. `` If we create a whole scheme of appeals and litigation to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> from enforcing the standards, then we'll have another run on the taxpayers because we wo n't have real money representing these institutions.'' The 51-member banking committee approved the bill three weeks ago, two weeks after it was approved by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week changed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to make the $ 50 billion taxpayer share of the bailout part of the federal deficit over the next three years. After the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> completes its action, the bill still has to go before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> before reaching the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor for action there _ now anticipated the second week of June.

Sales during the latest mid-May period were helped by incentives programs by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Big Three's incentive plans expired just as the mid-May period began a year ago. The companies said they sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 37,126 during the May 11-20 period this year, compared with an average daily rate of 36,299 during the same time last year. Car sales rose 2.3 percent and sales of light trucks were up 2.2 percent. On May 11, 1988, large portions of the Big Three's incentive packages expired. The selling rate during the first 10-day period of May 1988 was stronger than what proved to be the annual rate, partly because people accelerated their buying plans to take advantage of the incentives. This year, the Big Three initiated incentive programs in late March or early April. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s expires May 31 and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s June 5. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s incentive program runs indefinitely. So far this year, the Big Three have sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 34,501, down 5.3 percent from the rate of 36,412 during the period last year. Between New Year's Day and May 20, car sales have fallen 7.7 percent and truck sales have dropped 1 percent on a year-to-year comparison. Cars sold by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> at an average daily rate of 7,616 during the period this month, compared with 7,410 last year, a 2.8 percent increase. Car sales so far this year were running 0.5 percent behind last year's rate. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s mid-May truck sales were 6.1 percent higher than the rate during the period last year and, for the year, were running 2.9 percent behind last year's pace. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said its cars sold at a daily rate of 11,895 during mid-May this year, up 2.6 percent from the daily rate of 11,592 during the period last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s year-to-date car sales were down 9.6 percent. Truck sales in mid-May were up 4.6 percent and down 0.1 percent for the entire year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said its cars sold in mid-May at a daily rate of 3,378 this year, or 0.2 percent ahead of the 3,372-car-per-day rate during the period last year. So far this year, the No. 3 automaker's car sales were running 15.6 percent behind last year's rate Truck sales were off 6.4 percent in mid-May and 0.4 percent ahead of the pace during the same time last year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday adopted proposals for a law that would cut the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television programs shown in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, despite intense lobbying from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The proposed law will most likely be adopted by the governments of the 12 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> members at a meeting in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> June 14. The proposal was designed to coordinate broadcasting regulations in the 12-nation EEC and includes provisions to reserve a majority of transmission time to European works and to limit the amount of advertising allowed on television. Parliamentarians adopted a strongly-worded amendment to try to ensure that at least 50.1 percent of entertainment programs broadcast be European-produced by 1993. Last week, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plumb </ORGANIZATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, to express <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s strong objections to the proposal. `` The enactment of such a measure is unjustifiable and would almost certainly have a disastrous effect on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry's substantial European earnings,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> wrote `` Whatever benefits this television directive might promise to bring to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will undoubtedly be outweighed by its extremely negative impact on our bilateral trade relations,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> warned that if the measure were adopted, she would `` have no choice but to consider how to proceed in response to it under ... ` special 301' provisions.'' These provisions allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to issue a list of nations that have erected the most harmful barriers against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products. The administration would have 18 months to negotiate the removal of the barriers and if it failed, it could slap 100 percent levies on imports from these trading partners. Members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation said legislators had listened to their arguments but said the TV law was `` a matter of political concern.'' The measure is part of steps being taken by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in its drive to form a single market _ allowing the free flow of goods, people and money among the dozen nations _ by the end of 1992.

 If you believe the optimists of Wall Street, the stock market is sending out a happy message for the American economy these days. The crash of 1987 is fading fast into history, without having caused much trouble outside the world of Wall Street itself. And the economy, which has n't suffered an official recession in seven years, appears to be sailing into the 1990s with its momentum intact and no slump in sight. But the six-month-old rally in stock prices that has helped engender this kind of enthusiasm still has its skeptics. In fact, they maintain, investors in the securities markets have drifted into a dream world that could be setting them up for another rude shock. From the middle of November through the end of last week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose almost 23 percent, surpassing the 2,500 level for the first time since a week before the Black Monday crash of Oct. 19, 1987. The average, which is the oldest and best known measure of market trends, has moved within striking distance of the high of 2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987. By some gauges that include dividends as well as the level of stock prices, the market already has recouped all its 1987 losses and has reached new peaks, maintains <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON>, editor of the investment advisory letter <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Any way it's measured, it has been a remarkable comeback _ especially considering that it took stocks 25 years to recover from the crash of 1929 The rally has drawn support from a spreading belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has found a way to steer the economy safely past the threat of rising inflation without causing any serious slump in production, consumption or investment. It also has bolstered the case of `` new wave'' economists who believe that the system, for a variety of reasons, is now able to withstand the forces that used to drive it into a cyclical decline every four years or so. `` The new wave is on a roll,'' declares one of its most prominent proponents, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> at the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Of course, inflation is still a problem. But there are many recent developments that should help to offset such business cycle pressures as high capacity utilization and low unemployment, which in the past pushed inflation higher.'' Meanwhile, corporate earnings, a primary long-term determinant of stock market trends, have risen sharply in the past couple of years. `` The market has far firmer foundations now than when it last moved to this general level in mid-1987,'' <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON> says. But a vocal group of dissenters calls this kind of reasoning not only dubious but dangerous. `` Players in the stock market are dancing to a tune only they can hear,'' says <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Ladenburg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thalmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` When tight money bites in earnest, repercussions will ripple through the entire economy. In many ways, the atmosphere in <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> reminds us of the summer of 1987, just prior to the market meltdown.'' Says <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Legg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>: `` The slowdown in the economy currently under way is supposed to make a ` soft landing' without going into recession. `` Several new bull market scenarios call for ` the nicest recession you've ever seen' that would lower interest rates and cause foreign money to come surging into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock market. `` In our view this all sounds like ` deja voodoo' _ the best of all possible worlds. There is a recession out there somewhere in time and all the ` new era' or ` new wave' rhetoric wo n't make it go away.''

<HEAD>Despite Big Problems in the Airline Business, Strong Season Predicted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 From labor travails to terrorist threats to rising fuel prices to aging planes, the nation's airlines face daunting challenges as their busiest season of the year begins this Memorial Day weekend. Nonetheless, many industry analysts and travel agents expect a strong summer for air travel, as stable fares at home and a more valuable dollar abroad lure vacationers. `` I think it's going to be a record summer,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> securities firm. The airline industry has been turned on its head, with competition growing fiercer and takeover raiders swarming over profitable <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. But the industry's biggest trauma this year, a bitter labor strike at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, has n't resulted in the mass inconvenience to travelers that originally was feared. In fact, it's turned out to be a boon for Eastern's leading competitors. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, especially, are reaping windfall profits from the woes of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since March 9. Together, the rivals have captured an estimated $ 6 million to $ 7 million a day in revenue lost by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has been virtually grounded by the walkout that started March 4. The extra profits have given many big airlines a cushion against surging fuel prices, sparing them from having to hike fares, <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> and others suggested. Eastern's sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced last month that it was raising its `` MaxSaver'' discount fares by up to 18 percent. But <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, often a price leader, recently retracted the fare hike after other carriers failed to match its initiative. That could signal an end, at least for a while, to what had been a trend of rising fares. Air tariffs have increased as much as 20 percent this year over 1988, some analysts reckon. `` I do n't think there are going to be vast increases in fares,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` -LRB- The airlines -RRB- have tested almost the limits of fares.'' The halt to the fare spiral has occurred despite a dramatic rise in prices of jet fuel caused partly by the Alaskan oil spill and expectations of possible short oil supplies. Jet fuel, one of the biggest costs in the airline industry, has jumped to about 65 cents a gallon from 58.7 cents in February, before the March 24 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> tanker spill that delayed shipments of crude oil to refineries. Projections by <ORGANIZATION> Avmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an aviation consulting concern, suggest jet fuel costs will rise even more in years ahead, hitting at least 80 cents a gallon by the end of the century. Since they're not raising fares, many carriers are resorting to more creative ways of making money. The most important strategy is the use of sophisticated reservations computers to determine the lowest possible number of cut-rate tickets that should be offered on each flight. That's why it's often difficult or impossible to get a discount seat on a high-demand, New York-Los Angeles Sunday afternoon flight, and easy to fly cheaply midweek from <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The apparent slowdown in the economy, credited in part to higher interest rates that have discouraged consumers from spending, does n't appear to have dampened air travel. `` It may darken the skies a bit, but I do n't see any big storm clouds,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He expects passenger traffic this summer to be at least as good as last year within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and `` stronger than a lot of people think'' overseas. `` Our business is up fairly substantially for this summer over last year,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> DMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Bookings to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are running 15 percent to 30 percent above last summer, while domestic travel is up slightly, he estimated. The anticipated growth in foreign travel is largely due to the rebounding dollar, analysts say. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency has been surging in value against the Japanese yen, West German mark and British pound in recent weeks. This means it takes fewer dollars to vacation in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than it did a year ago. In addition, international airlines like <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> are sharply discounting fares to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this summer. Pan Am's foreign passenger traffic rose 1.9 percent in December 1988 from a year earlier. But it dropped 8.6 percent in January and 14.0 percent in February _ largely as a result of the Dec. 21 crash of a U.S.-bound flight over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> that has been blamed on a terrorist bomb. The disaster scared many potential fliers away. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s overseas traffic has been picking up and is expected to post an increase for May, spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Air terrorism is n't the only fear of flying that has kept travelers away. Some would-be passengers are still wary of the stories about aging planes that break up in midair, despite the recent flurry of orders for new aircraft by many big carriers seeking to rejuvenate their fleets. There are constant reminders. This past Tuesday, for example, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> laid the major blame on <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' maintenance program for failing to detect fatigue damage to the fuselage of a 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 that split open over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> slightly more than a year ago.

 Turmoil within the airline industry has some passengers a little nervous, but they're still flying and generally want the government to stay out of the business. Random interviews with travelers by AP reporters at big airports nationwide suggested the underlying demand for airline seats remains strong as the country heads into the traditional Memorial Day summer kickoff. At the same time, there's a high level of awareness by the traveling public on issues confronting the airline industry. There's a bitter <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is on the auction block and aging aircraft is a frequent topic. Flying `` is probably less safe because some of the jets are a lot older,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> businessman passing through <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> this week. `` Structurally they're beginning to have problems, I guess.'' Many carriers are rushing to buy airplanes to expand and replace their fleets. This past Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported an `` industry-wide deficiency'' in the inspection of the popular but aging <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 airplanes. `` Everybody's on strike,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Siska </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> businessman said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` You've got management doing work that they're not qualified to do, and it's the passengers who take the risks.'' Despite the concerns, `` flying is still safer than driving,'' said <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, a jewelry salesman traveling through <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` It's safer than driving a car,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Reistroffer </PERSON>, 32, a Fairbanks, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, resident arriving at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` If you're going down the freeway, two cars at 50 mph, one driver sneezes, it's all over. A pilot can sneeze and he can go all over the place _ there's a lot of leeway.'' Employees, meanwhile, have mixed feelings about the changes in their industry. `` I have n't noticed any difference in the attitude here at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>,'' said one pilot in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` My job has not changed one iota.'' But a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said, `` I feel secure that <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> wants to stay in the airline business, but buyout possibilities make me a little nervous.'' An American flight attendant in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said, `` I make less money because of deregulation. The girls who have been flying for more than 10 or 15 years are making 30 to 40 -LRB- thousand dollars a year -RRB-, and those who've been flying for 10 years or less only make 10 to 20 -LRB- thousand -RRB-.'' American's two-tier wage scale, where it takes 12 years to reach top pay, is a frequent target of union criticism and was one of the important issues in recently concluded contract negotiations. A businessman at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> agreed the government should n't reassert its regulatory authority over the airline business, which it largely relinquished 10 years ago. `` Prices are going up, there's no question. A lot of it is to cover their operating expenses,'' he said. `` But because of deregulation many airlines are marking down their prices to compete. Passenger traffic is up, but I think they are concentrating on improving their aircraft and upgrading maintenance.'' `` The airlines are doing just fine now and competition will establish the price,'' he said. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kensy </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> airplane mechanic travel through <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, was one of the few who said more regulation is needed. `` It's letting people get a little loose with what they do,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kensy </PERSON> said. `` Safety, service, they're all sliding a little bit here and there.'' The changes in the industry are having some effect on the airports, depending on their connections with specific airlines. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, for example, is a major hub for Eastern and, `` at times it certainly has been more hectic due to the Eastern strike,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> employee. But at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the main effect of the Eastern strike is expected to be a boost in public relations value. DFW spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dealey </PERSON> said the reduction in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s operations in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> should allow the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> airport to leapfrog over <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> to become the world's second or third busiest airport DFW last year ranked third in operations behind <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> and fourth in passengers behind those and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Woman Awarded $3.1 Million From Stockbroker, Investment Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> woman who says her stockbroker used her investment account to generate more than $ 1 million in commissions for himself has been awarded $ 3.1 million by an arbitration panel. In one of the biggest securities case awards ever, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> disclosed Tuesday that an arbitration panel ordered that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 42, be paid $ 1 million by broker <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and $ 2.1 million by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, his former employer. <PERSON> Dahle </PERSON> declined comment on the award. Mrs. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> also declined comment. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Faigen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the brokerage would appeal the decision. Mrs. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Dahle </PERSON> traded in her account to generate commissions _ a process called `` churning'' _ and breached his fiduciary duty, purchased stock on credit without her permission and bought investment products that were unsuitable. <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> also ordered <PERSON> Dahle </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> jointly to pay attorneys' fees and other expenses involved in the litigation, which lasted more than seven months Mrs. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, said the woman's actual monetary loss totaled about $ 200,000 on stocks and an undetermined amount on the limited partnerships. In addition, lost investment opportunities cost Mrs. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> more than $ 2 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> arbitration documents filed Tuesday in federal court. Mrs. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s father was one of the founders of <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lanier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, two Atlanta-based companies. Over a period of several years, <PERSON> Dahle </PERSON> became such a trusted adviser of Mrs. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s that she approved whatever he recommended, even though she was not sophisticated about investments, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> complaint. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that about half of all the stocks <PERSON> Dahle </PERSON> purchased for Mrs. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> were sold in less than 30 days. Mrs. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s complaint charged that <PERSON> Dahle </PERSON> generated $ 132,972 in commissions in 1985, $ 852,202 in 1986 and $ 17,272 in 1987 by trading in her account.

 Stock prices closed slightly higher in moderate, uneventful trading today with little news to spur investors. The market opened lower behind weakening bond prices after the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> said it would raise its base lending rate from 13 percent to 14 percent.

<HEAD>OPEC Says Figures Show Members Supplied Bit More Than Production
Accord</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations supplied slightly more oil to the world market in April than allowed in a production accord designed to lift crude prices, the organization said Wednesday. It was the first time this year that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reported a supply level above the ceiling set in an agreement covering output for the first six months of 1989. Private analysts have detected a recent pickup in production by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, secretary-general of the 13-nation oil organization, urged the producers to try `` to sustain the present hard-won stability in the market.'' `` Production restraint by all producers, both inside and outside <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, is still necessary in view of the fragility of the present price structure,'' he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The statement said 12 of the 13 members poured 17.54 million barrels a day into the international market last month. The production agreement for the first half of 1989 sets a supply target of 17.51 million barrels a day for the 12 members. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> said total production by the dozen nations amounted to 18.47 million barrels a day in April. Figures were not available for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, it said. `` The so-called <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> overproduction to which the media has been calling attention has not been supplied to the market, but has gone into building stocks, in a concerted effort by member countries not to destabilize the market,'' the cartel said. `` During January to April, the 12 countries added nearly 70 million barrels to their stocks _ 38.3 million barrels to stocks held abroad and 31.6 million to those within national boundaries,'' it said. Analysts have attributed the recent increase in production partly to an effort by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations to stake out positions in advance of a key meeting next month in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. At that gathering, the oil chiefs will agree on a production level for the second half of the year and set individual quotas for each country. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, analysts say, want a bigger share of the overall ceiling negotiated by the producers. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, in its Monthly Oil Market Report, estimated <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> output at 20.5 million barrels a day in April, up from 19.8 million barrels the previous month. The current accord, worked out in late November, set a production limit of 18.5 million barrels a day for the entire cartel. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> measures a nation's quota by figuring crude production and the amount of oil put into, or drawn out, of stocks. The output ceiling, well under December levels, was set in an effort to boost prices to a target of 18 dollars a barrel. Prices soared beyond that benchmark, although the rally has eased a bit recently. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude, has been trading in the range of 19 dollars to 20 dollars a barrel. The price surge has been attributed not only to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production cuts but also to accidents in oil-producing areas that have reduced the supply in the world market

<TEXT>
 Car and truck sales rose a modest 2.7 percent in mid-May from the same period last year, manufacturers reported Wednesday, although analysts noted the sales compared with a year-earlier period that may have been slower than usual. During the May 11-20 period, sales of cars and light trucks made by the eight major U.S.-based automakers rose to a rate of 39,360 a day from a pace of 38,334 during the same period last year. Last year many buyer incentives expired May 11, prompting some consumers to hasten purchase plans in order to take advantage of the deals. That effectively borrowed purchases from later sales periods. In the May 11-20 period this year, wide-ranging incentive programs by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and some of the other major automakers were in effect. But analyst <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudol </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Fitch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said consumers seemed to be ignoring the bait. `` I do n't know what it's going to take to bring customers back to the showrooms,'' she said. `` I think demand is just tired at this point.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, a senior economist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McLain </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said: `` Basically, what sales have shown is that the underlying demand is less than what most people expected. Given those sales, there's going to have to be some further -LRB- production -RRB- cuts. They would be modest, though.'' Automakers have been trimming their inventories by offering incentives to spur sales and by cutting production. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said that on May 31, when the company's current incentive program expires, he expected another, more limited incentive package to be announced. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s program ends June 5 and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s continues indefinitely. The incentive programs were prompted by slower-than-anticipated sales during the first three months of the year. Through May 20, car and truck sales by the eight makers were 3.6 percent behind the pace during the same period last year, which was the second-best in automotive history. Car sales were down 5.4 percent and truck sales were down 0.3 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sold cars at an average daily rate of 7,616 during May 11-20 this year, up 2.8 percent from the 7,410 rate a year earlier. Car sales for the year to date period were 0.5 percent behind last year's rate. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s mid-May truck sales were 6.1 percent higher than the rate during the period last year and, for the year, were running 2.9 percent behind last year's pace. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars sold at a daily rate of 11,895 during mid-May this year, up 2.6 percent from 11,592 during the year-earlier period. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s year-to-date car sales were down 9.6 percent <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> truck sales in mid-May were up 4.6 percent and down 0.1 percent for the year to date. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said its cars sold in mid-May at a daily rate of 3,378 this year, up 0.2 percent from the 3,372 daily rate during the year-earlier period. For the year to date the No. 3 automaker's car sales were 15.6 percent behind last year's rate. Truck sales were off 6.4 percent in mid-May and 0.4 percent ahead of the year to date pace a year earlier.

 <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> held a peanut butter jar in one hand and in the other she clutched the notice that <ORGANIZATION> Publix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Super </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was abandoning green stamps. She took it hard. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> was on the front lines of making <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> the top green stamp redemption area for <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hutchinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> since the mid 1980s. For years, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> had been turning S & amp; H green stamp books into toasters, a breakfast set and dozens of other gadgets and knickknacks. `` And now no more? Are they serious? Who decided this?'' she said. The decision by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; H's largest customer to drop green stamps from its <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> stores this Saturday reflects the troubles and transitions at the 94-year-old trading stamp stalwart, which is banking on high-technology ventures such as plastic shopper ID cards to adapt to changing consumer habits. They say the days of pasting stamps in saver books may be numbered. In the past two decades, green stamps have gone the way of the beauty shop-groomed housewife. They now are largely a symbol of nostalgia. In 1969, more than 77 percent of supermarkets and 20 percent of service stations gave out green stamps. Today, the sticky green strips are available in less than 7 percent of check-out lines and in less than 1 percent of the gas stations. `` People just do n't go home and lick stamps anymore,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroter </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Publix </ORGANIZATION>, which accounted for 35 percent of green stamp sales nationwide last year. `` There's been a steady decline in interest in green stamps.'' <ORGANIZATION> Publix </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's ninth-largest supermarket chain with 361 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> stores, cut green stamps in 1986 from its southwest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> stores and followed suit in northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> the following year. The high concentration of elderly green stamp loyalists in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> kept the program going until this month, said <PERSON> Schroter </PERSON>. `` Many of our younger customers did n't even know what green stamps were,'' he said. `` It's a thing of the past that does n't fit in well anymore.'' Like other supermarkets around the country, Lakeland-based <ORGANIZATION> Publix </ORGANIZATION> have been experimenting with other shopper incentives, such as a frequent-buyer award system the using a credit card-type device to log visits. Market researchers at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; H agree their traditional following has been eroded by the popularity of discount coupons and an increase in working couples too busy to deal with stamp books. Since the heydays of the late 1960s, when stores paid more than $ 360 million for the postage-size presents, there are now less than 2,000 supermarkets, truck stops and other outlets that pay to carry the stamps, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; H's revenue is down to $ 130 million, according to published reports. S & amp; H declines to give figures on sales and jealously guards details about its new projects. `` It's no secret we've been losing stores. The question is how are we going to react,'' said a senior <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; H executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The New York-based holding company <ORGANIZATION> Leucadia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; H in 1986 along with its purchase of <ORGANIZATION> PHLCORP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Baldwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. With little change in operations since the last century _ with the exception of self-adhesive stamps in 1986 and the addition of upscale items to its catalog _ the company plans to make startling changes perhaps has early as this year Shoppers across the nation may soon see S & amp; H cards with magnetic strips to record purchases. The points will be tendered for gifts of cash. A full green stamp book is currently worth $ 1.20. In a recent article in Advertising Age magazine, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; H marketing director <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said 95 percent of customers at Weis Markets in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> accepted the plastic cards, and 87 percent used them to build points for rebates or items. Also, the company is studying use of a sophisticated data base to record the type of items purchased or garner demographics, such as sex and age. `` We're going electronic,'' the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; H executive said. `` We're not standing still.''

 The dollar resumed its climb against all key currencies except the British pound and Swiss franc Wednesday, breaking the 143-yen level overseas and hitting a 1 -LCB- - year high vs. the Japanese currency in domestic trading `` It's like a train. You ca n't step in front of it or you'll get run over,'' said one investment banker, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON> of Beverly Hills-based <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, gold prices were up domestically after losing in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and rising in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said the late bid for a troy ounce of gold was $ 362.40, up 55 cents from Tuesday's close. Currency dealers said trading was volatile here and overseas, with the dollar starting out weak after a mixed performance Tuesday but ending stronger in the absence of significant central-bank intervention or signs of policy changes geared toward stabilizing exchange rates. The British government boosted interest rates, which helped the sagging pound. But dealers said there was no indication that either <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would change their rates, and they said that helped strengthen the dollar. Traders said the dollar firmed after reports of West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> officials dismissing speculation that they would hold an emergency policy-setting meeting to possibly raise interest rates to support the mark. Further helping the dollar, they said, were President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments that he was concerned about the dollar's rise but remained confident exchange rates could stabilize through coordination between the Group of Seven The <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> includes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The dollar has risen sharply in recent days for several reasons, including the comparably high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, growing inflation overseas and perceived weakness among the G-7 in foreign-exchange policies. After concerted central bank intervention Tuesday and dollar-selling by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, no central bank besides the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> was evident in the European open market Wednesday. The British pound, which has lost 14 percent in value against the dollar this year, edged up to $ 1.5695 from $ 1.5675 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> hiked a key lending rate from 13 percent to a four-year high of 14 percent. Sterling fetched $ 1.5700 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from $ 1.5645. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 1.05 Japanese yen to a closing 143.00 yen, a 19-month high. It eased to 142.78 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and closed at 142.775 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 142.30 Tuesday. Traders said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> close was the highest since October 1987. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Tuesday, included: 2.0137 West German marks, up from 2.0110; 1.7855 Swiss francs, down from 1.7915; 1.20845 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19945; 6.8225 French francs, up from 6.8100; and 1,459.00 Italian lire, up from 1,457.50. Dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Tuesday: 2.0115 West German marks, up from 2.0079; 1.7887 Swiss francs, up from 1.7820; 6.8250 French francs, up from 6.7865; 2.2670 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2570; 1,455.75 Italian lire, up from 1,451.50; and 1.1985 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1975. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $ 364.50 a troy ounce from $ 363.80 Tuesday. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 362.75 an ounce from $ 364.25 late Tuesday. It fell in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> to $ 362.60 an ounce from $ 364.25.

 Crude oil futures prices rose sharply in brisk trading Wednesday, a reaction to tight inventories reported by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the July contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the key <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, ended at $ 19.66 a 42-gallon barrel, up 62 cents after a 43-cent gain Tuesday. The June contract expired Monday and finished at $ 20.93, with a gain of 33 cents from Friday's close. Prices for crude oil contracts for delivery after July all posted sharp gains. Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale home heating oil for delivery in June rose 2.11 cents to 49.61 cents a gallon after rising 0.52 cent on Tuesday. The June contract for unleaded gasoline rose 2.59 cents to 66.83 cents following Tuesday's gain of 0.34 cent. Analysts said prices rallied early on the inventory figures, which were released after the market closed on Tuesday. The API reported a 3.13 million barrel decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil inventories in the week ended May 19, indicating high demand and usage. Gasoline stocks fell 2.61 million barrels and heating oil inventories declined 1.58 million barrels for the week, the institute reported.

 The stock market shook off an early slump and closed higher Wednesday in a generally quiet session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed up 5.86 points at 2,483.87. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 762 issues up, 661 down and 534 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 178.60 million shares, down from 187.69 million in Tuesday's session. The market opened lower following a weakening of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond prices after the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> said it would raise its base lending rate from 13 percent to 14 percent. Stocks rebounded slightly after midday, following a rally in the bond market. Analysts said the market was trendless for most of the day, with some investors taking profits amid mostly balanced buying and selling. Late in the day, however, traders said selling dried up. `` The market was pretty uneventful overall,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, technical analyst with <PERSON> Janney </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` The perceptions were mixed with respect to what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is going to do.'' `` Most of the interest was in stocks thought to be potential takeover targets,'' <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON> said. `` But there really was not any one focal point for the market today.'' Tuesday's session focused on activity in the currency markets, with stocks declining amid speculation over whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would push <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates lower to stem the rising dollar or whether <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would raise its discount rate to support the falling yen. Many analysts said Wednesday that despite earlier concerns that the dollar might be rising too fast _ which could have negative implications for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit _ the market continued to view the stronger dollar as an overall positive. The dollar strengthened further against the Japanese yen and major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies on Wednesday. Market activity is expected to slow over the next two days going into the long Memorial Day holiday weekend and then resume an upward trend next week, traders said. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 208.58 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market rose $ 6.702 billion, or 0.21 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 0.36 to 177.97. Among actively traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, Avon rose 1 -RRB- to 35 ~ amid new takeover speculation Oil stocks also showed broad-based gains with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> up 1 to 55 |, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- higher to 43 -RCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> up ~ to 56 <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> also gained \ to 109 -RCB- and Prime Computer rose 1 to 16 -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, fell -LCB- to 51 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> fell -RCB- to 47 -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> lost -LRB- to 27 -LRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 1.33 to 366.05, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index closed 0.82 higher at 319.14. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 1.34 to 441.90.

<TEXT>
 French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said Wednesday that he will ask the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to approve the writeoff of more than than 16 billion francs, $ about 2.7 billion, in debt owed to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> by 35 impoverished nations. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> made the announcement at the opening of a summit of the heads of state of French-speaking countries. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> announced last year at the summit of the seven leading industrial nations that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was prepared to write off debt service payments owed it by the world's poorest countries. He repeated his commitment at the last Franco-African summit in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, earlier this year. At the <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> indicated <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was prepared to take additional steps and write off not only the debt service payments but all of the outstanding bilateral debt owed by certain countries. `` I told the summit in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION> that I would go farther and today I am keeping this promise,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> told the 16 heads of state Wednesday at the Francophone Summit. Senegalese President <PERSON> Abdou </PERSON> <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON>, responding to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s announcement at the summit opening, said, `` You have created the event of the summit before it even begins. Major creditor governments agreed at the annual joint meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> last September in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to include debt service write-offs as one of three options for easing the debt burdens of the world's poorest countries. Officials in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has written off almost 800 million francs, about $ 133 million, of official bilateral debt service payments since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> agreement. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> is the only other country so far to have chosen the debt write-off option. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had a strong colonial influence in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> earlier this century and has maintained its privileged relationship with many African states. The debt problems of both middle-income and poor countries are expected to be high on the agenda when leaders of the so-called Group of Seven _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ meet in mid-July in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for an economic summit.

<HEAD>Energy Prices Rise As OPEC Meeting Nears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Energy futures prices climbed Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting increased confidence that the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations will agree on production quotas for later this year. On other markets, grain and soybean prices drifted lower, precious metals finished mixed, and livestock and pork prices plunged. There had been speculation in the energy market that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would be unable to agree at its June meeting on production quotas for the second half of the year. There is greater confidence now, reflected in prices, that an agreement will be reached, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an energy analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 44 cents to 62 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 19.66 a barrel; heating oil was 1.75 cents to 2.11 cents higher with June at 49.61 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.13 cents to 2.59 cents higher with June at 66.83 cents a gallon. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the sharp rise in energy prices also can be attributed to a report from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> that total oil stocks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are down 9 million to 10 million barrels. Traders also reacted to reports that Norwegian helicopter pilots servicing <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil platforms could go on strike. A prolonged strike would cut deeply into <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million barrel daily <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil production, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Grain and soybean futures drifted lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as rain continued to fall in growing areas. `` The price of the new crop corn and soybeans were reflecting enhanced soil moisture,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Soybean futures suffered as some private forecasts suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> 6 - to 10-day outlook will indicate above-normal rain in crop areas Wheat prices were up with news from exporters that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> bought about 300,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soft red winter and soft white wheat. Corn prices were down, but up from the day's low because of technical support and spillover from a rally in soybean futures. Wheat settled 2 -LCB- cents lower to 3 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.98 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 5 -RCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.62; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 cents lower with July at $ 1.73 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 7 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 6.97 \ a bushel Precious metals prices were up a fraction in fairly quiet trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` The precious metals market is still concerned about the strength of the dollar,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The market is oversold, but the feeling is prices will continue on the down side,'' <PERSON> Demler </PERSON> said. Gold settled 20 cents to 60 cents higher with June at $ 364.70; silver was unchanged with June at $ 5.181. Copper, which has given up nine cents this week, was down again Wednesday .50 cent to .70 cent with May at $ 1.08 a pound. Increases in exchange inventories, high world-wide production and low industrial consumption is pushing down copper prices, <PERSON> Demler </PERSON> said. Livestock futures were sharply lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The drop in the cattle market was caused by stop-loss selling and computer fund liquidation, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Linnco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The drop was assisted by a weak cash market outlook. Pork futures reacted negatively to heavy movement of bellies into storage and heavy hog marketings this week. Live cattle settled .10 cent to 1.10 cents lower with June at 69.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .65 cent lower with May at 76.72 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .62 cent lower with June at 48.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.17 cents to 1.70 cents lower with July at 33.10 cents a pound.

 Stock speculators renewed their interest in <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Wednesday, bidding the cosmetics company's shares higher in response to a report that <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> may be the target of a hostile takeover attempt Separately, a congressman asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to investigate <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> stock purchases prior to a failed bid by <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on grounds that investor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> executives may have sought to skirt antitrust laws. Avon stock closed up $ 1.37 -LCB- to $ 35.87 -LCB- in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 3.13 million shares changing hands. Composite trading volume in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> stock on Tuesday amounted to 962,100 shares. The catalyst for the heavy trading appeared to be a report published in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today that said <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and an unidentified `` major company'' plan to launch a joint bid for Avon at $ 40 a share. A secretary in <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' office in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> said he was out of town and unavailable to comment. The newspaper said <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and the company are in the process of completing financing and other details of the hostile offer. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' partner was said to be a company other than <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Dallas-based cosmetics seller that reportedly has expressed an interest in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> owns 10.3 percent of <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s common stock through a partnership with <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>, an Ada, Mich.-based direct selling firm last week withdrew its $ 39-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s board rejected the proposal USA Today said if <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and his partner prevail over <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> would meld part of <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s business into his <ORGANIZATION> Watkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which sells vitamins, beauty products and foods door-to-door. Avon spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said the company had no comment on the report. One Wall Street arbitrager said the report was treated with some skepticism and did n't trigger as much buying as it might have if the memory of the losses sustained when <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its proposal were n't still fresh in speculators' minds. Avon stock surged to a 52-week high of $ 41.25 shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s May 10 bid amid hope that the bid might be increased. When <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> pulled out the stock sank. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on Wednesday asked the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to investigate <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> stock purchases by <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> executives prior to <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s bid Antitrust laws require that a proposed merger must be reported if the acquirer holds 15 percent or more of the target's voting stock. `` In the case of the attempted <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> takeover, Mr. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> appear to have sought to avoid this requirement by arranging for the purchase of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> stock in the name of the A-J Partnership,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> wrote in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>. A-J Partnership was the vehicle used by <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> to launch their takeover bid. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> have said there was nothing illegal or improper about their stock transactions.

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some of the nation's top computer scientists, angry over a wave of lawsuits seeking to copyright basic computer software, picketed Wednesday outside the headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The scientists said <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> and a handful of other computer companies are trying to lock up rights to software that is as fundamental to computers as a steering wheel and pedals are to a car. `` If there were copyrights like this on cars, then every manufacturer would have to give you a different way to steer,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallman </PERSON>, a programmer at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you learned to drive a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, you would n't know how to drive Chevrolets.'' Chanting slogans through a bullhorn, <PERSON> Stallman </PERSON> led about 150 <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> professors, graduate students and programmers from Boston-area computer firms in a march from <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>'s Technology Square to <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters. Under gray skies and intermittent rain, they picketed for about an hour, carrying signs saying `` Innovation Not Litigation,'' `` Do n't Ruin Our Industry'' and `` No Writs For Bits.'' The rash of lawsuits includes complaints filed by Apple Computer against competitors <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION>, and by <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> against <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>, which makes the best-selling computer accounting program Lotus 1-2-3, is suing competitors <ORGANIZATION> Paperback </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosaic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. All of the suits allege illegal copying of a `` user interface,'' technical jargon for what is often called the `` look and feel'' of a computer program, including its basic commands, menus and displays Lotus and many other software companies contend that unless their products enjoy strong copyright protection, they will not have an economic incentive to develop new programs. `` Our argument is that out-and-out copying of other people's work stifles creativity and innovation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosheff </PERSON> `` Copyright law allows you to take other people's work and build on it, but not to steal it. The protest grew out of an advertisement placed in an <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> student newspaper last month by <PERSON> Stallman </PERSON>; <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, a professor of electrical engineering; and <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Minsky </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Artificial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. They warned that the lawsuits could freeze out new companies, make computers harder to use and, ultimately, retard the industry. `` Until quite recently, people invented things, everybody gave each other all their software, we had fun and people made money anyway,'' <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I'd like to see that come back.'' <PERSON> Stallman </PERSON>, a prominent programmer who developed EMACS, a widely used system for editing computer programs, said it is in the public interest to have computer programs share basic attributes, so users do not have to learn each program from scratch. The lawsuits, he charged, will lead to `` inefficiency and gratuitous incompatibility,'' with `` a heavy cost for the economy.'' Among the protesters were <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocher </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinery </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abelson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> professor who helped develop the Logo educational computer language; <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomonoff </PERSON>, an eminent <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> mathematician; and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>'s Artificial Intelligence lab. <PERSON> Stallman </PERSON> said the protesters have formed a new organization, the League for Programming Freedom, to try to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> and other firms to drop the lawsuits. In leaflets handed out at the pickets, the group urged people to boycott the firms bringing the lawsuits and to buy competing products instead. They also advised programmers not to go to work for <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. Copyright lawyers said the rash of `` look and feel'' lawsuits began in late 1986, after a federal judge in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ruled that a small software company, <ORGANIZATION> Unison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had infringed a competitor's copyright on a program for making customized greeting cards. Since then, several companies have won similar cases, but `` each case, rather than settling the law, has tended to unsettle it and raise more questions,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M.S </PERSON>. Hemnes, a partner in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Foley </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>. Hemnes and other attorneys said the issue of how much of a computer's basic programming can be patented eventually may be decided by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers Wednesday lashed out at `` fax attacks'' by advertisers who bombard facsimile machines with unsolicited material, and they said telephone merchandisers who use computers to dial phone numbers at random could endanger public health and safety. The lawmakers said advertisers were shooting themselves in the foot with intrusive sales pitches that in the case of facsimiles use up their receivers' paper and for mobile and pager-phone users often make them pay for the calls. On top of that, citizens have a right to privacy, said Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., the author of one of three bills that would restrain the use of `` junk fax'' advertising and computer auto-dialers <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> told a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee that it was `` stupid'' to assert that restrictions on unsolicited telepone messages would violate the senders' First Amendment rights. `` We're saying that you ca n't use technology to burden other people,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> testified. `` We're not putting anybody out of business; we're not interfering with anybody's rights.'' The subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said unsolicited telemarketing `` increasingly crosses the line between helpful and unacceptably obtrusive. He noted that in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> 200,000 phone customers _ 7 percent of the state's total _ said yes recently when asked if they wished to be excluded from such calls. Computers can dial 1,000 phone numbers a day with pre-recorded messages, <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said. `` Each day they are used by more than 180,000 solicitors to call more than 7 million Americans. Unfortunately, these machines are often programmed to dial sequentially whole blocks of numbers, including hospitals, fire stations, pagers and unlisted numbers.'' `` This not only makes the machine an equal opportunity nuisance, but an equal opportunity hazard,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s bill would make it illegal to make interstate computer-dialed calls to anyone who told their phone company they did n't want such messages. It would require advertisers to pay the costs for phone companies to maintain lists of such customers. A bill co-sponsored by <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and Reps. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., would require the same for unsolicited messages to facsimile A bill by Rep. <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Roukema </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, would make auto-dialed solicitations illegal unless the calls were placed between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays; the messages gave the name and telephone number of the caller; and the computer automatically disconnected the call five seconds after the called party hangs up or refuses to hear the message. <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON> said telephone lines have become `` life lines'' for businesses and citizens, particularly the elderly. Abuses of phone lines `` not only are inconvenient and costly to consumers, they even could endanger the lives of our citizens.'' Tying up emergency phones lines with auto-dialers that wo n't disconnect `` clearly has the potential for disaster,'' <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON> said `` There may be legitimate purposes for which auto-dialers can be used. However, they should not be permitted to endanger the usefulness of the telephone.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, a vice president with the <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told the subcommittee his group was `` sympathetic to the concerns expressed by the bills.'' He said his group opposes sequential dialing by telemarketers and it favored standards that would require immediate disconnects. But he said it would be very difficult to define, as <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>'s bill requires, `` unsolicited'' messages and what constitutes a `` pre-existing'' business relationship that would allow transmission of unsolicited material to offices. He said there also were about 1,000 directories of facsimile machine phone numbers and it would be `` difficult and costly'' to purge them of names. He urged the subcommittee to let the marketplace decide if unsolicited facsimile ads were going to be anything more than a short-lived phenomenon. Professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> said many businesses want to receive ads from sellers they deal with regularly. He said restrictions could `` chill'' normal business correspondence.

 All <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> has ordered 10 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners and taken options to buy 10 more in a deal estimated at $ 1.5 billion, while regional carrier <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said separately Wednesday it plans to buy up to 100 <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> turboprop commuter aircraft in an agreement analysts valued at $ 750 million All Nippon, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest carrier and the eighth-largest in the non-communist world, said in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> it was ordering and taking options on <LOCATION> Boeign </LOCATION> 767-300 jetliners. The airline, which sets up its 767-300s to carry about 275 passengers, plans to use the planes for medium-range foreign and domestic flights, said spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Winship </PERSON>. The first plane is scheduled for delivery in 1990, with deliveries through 1995, said <PERSON> Winship </PERSON>. In February, <ORGANIZATION> ANA </ORGANIZATION> ordered 20 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400s worth about $ 3.2 billion. The value of the latest order would reach $ 1.5 billion if all 10 options are exercised and engines and spare parts are included, the airline said. <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>, the regional airline partner of Ft.. Worth, Texas-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, on Wednesday announced plans to purchase up to 100 Saab 340B turboprop aircraft <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> placed 50 firm orders and took options for another 50 <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> 340Bs, which can carry 34 passengers each on trips of 700 statute miles or more. Also in the agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> are 50 options for the Saab 2000, a 50-seat aircraft. Deliveries would extend into the 1990s. `` These aircraft will meet our needs well into the next century and provide our passengers with the finest plane of its size available,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>, said in a prepared statement. The company announced the agreement at a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. Terms of the deal were not released. Industry analysts estimated the agreement for the 100 Saab 340Bs at about $ 750 million and <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> itself indicated earlier this month it was about to order 100 new commuter aircraft in a deal worth several hundred million dollars. The acquisition is the fourth major purchase by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> system this year. AMR will receive its first 15 Saab 340Bs in January 1990. They initially will be based at the airline's <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> hubs. More deliveries are scheduled for 1991, when the airline will receive 24 planes, and in 1992, with a shipment of 11 aircraft. Delivery is scheduled in 1992 and 1993 for the 340Bs on option, while the Saab 2000 options are scheduled between 1994 and 1997. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> described the aircraft as fuel efficient and said they are an important part of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>'s internal expansion plan. With the purchase, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> becomes the largest single purchaser of <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> 340Bs in the world.

 To critics, the <ORGANIZATION> Vancouver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has been a huckster's paradise, duping investors and sucking up capital that could be better used elsewhere. To defenders, the exchange fills a valid and serious economic function. They say it's where entrepreneurs turn to raise the start-up capital they need, a marketplace based in the region's mining and resource industries now moving into high technology and other innovative businesses The exchange has had its fair share of scandal and controversy since its founding in 1907, and a new round of criticism from such high profile business publications as <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> has placed it back in the spotlight. `` We do specialize in venture capital, and that by nature is risky,'' <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON>, the exchange's spokeswoman, said in an interview. `` People have long memories ... and it seems that people remember us by the bad company we've kept.'' The exchange claims to be the third most active, in volume, in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. The focus on `` junior companies,'' as the exchange prefers to call its start-up offerings, and the generally inexpensive price tags on their stocks push the volume up. A typical trade is 2,000 shares worth a total of $ 2,000. <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> calls the offerings on the exchange `` the start-up, the emerging, the young.'' Two-thirds of the companies on the <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> exchange still are in precious metal mining. The other third, and the fastest growing area, is in such venture capital fields as high-tech, agriculture and franchising. `` We're still really <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s mining exchange, but our world is changing too,'' <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> said. `` It's still buyer beware, and people do n't like to hear that,'' she said. `` The venture market is not for everybody.'' `` I think a lot of the misunderstanding is because we have less stringent listing requirements,'' she said. `` People misunderstand that, and we get labeled the Wild West and the Casino of the North.'' Indeed, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, the exchange's president, said first-time visitors almost invariably express surprise that the exchange is not a small operation but employs 320 people in several floors spread through a downtown skyscraper. `` We've taken the position that the world and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> does n't need another blue-chip stock exchange,'' he said `` Our view is that we've been in the venture business and we should make that our prime thrust.'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said that does n't mean emphasis will be taken away from the traditional resource-exploration stocks. `` But we are certainly going to do whatever we can to encourage listings outside the resource fields,'' he said. On March 1, the exchange overhauled listings rules and policies, requiring more complete disclosure about the companies issuing stocks. It added special requirements for companies outside of the resource-exploration area, partly because some of their stocks have raised alarm-bells about the potential for hype. Among the hard-to-assess stocks that have cropped up on the exchange, for example, are those from companies claiming to offer cosmetic franchises, treasure hunts and a new way to hull rice. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said it ca n't be denied that `` incidents'' have taken place with companies listed on the exchange and, `` they tend to be spectacular.'' `` The way to stop all that is, stop having incidents,'' he said. As recently as April, former stockbroker <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciochetti </PERSON> was sentenced to three years in prison and fined some 300,000 Canadian dollars, or $ 252,000, for for fraud in the rise and fall of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tillex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The New York-based insurance company was underwritten at 20 Canadian cents a share in January 1985 and rose to 77 Canadian dollars a share in 1986 before the exchange suspended trading. `` You ca n't have it both ways,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said when asked why fraud cases continue to surface if the exchange is making a more serious effort to regulate itself than it has in the past. He objected to those who say proper enforcement does n't exist and then say it's all bad when a case is found as a result of enforcement. `` Two years from now we wo n't have the court cases coming along with the frequency they've been coming along,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. Securities commissions operate at provincial level in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s historically has been weak. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said trading on the <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> exchange has not recovered fully since October 1987, hit harder in value than in volume. `` I do n't think we have bounced back,'' he said. `` Trading has been, how shall I describe this, slow.'' He ascribed it to worldwide trends and the slide in the price of gold, which has weakened the price of many mineral and mining stocks. Record volume of 4.8 billion shares worth $ 5.6 billion at current exchange rates in 1987 declined to 3.5 billion shares worth $ 2.7 billion last year. The exchange's index of all listed issues dropped from 1150.02 at the end of 1987 to 792.72 at the end of 1988. Elsewhere, analysts say a loss of confidence in the exchange also has played a part. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, publisher of the daily newsletter <PERSON> Vancouver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwatch </PERSON>, forecast 1989 as a stable year and said the overhaul of regulations is `` a big step in the repair job that the exchange had to do to stop its slide into oblivion.'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said no regulations can erase all bad cases on any exchange, but the new policies should eliminate what he called the `` joke companies'' that had proliferated in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> over the past five years. `` You have to conclude that the <ORGANIZATION> VSE </ORGANIZATION> has been weakened,'' he said. `` It is not in a good position to recover fast.''

 Bankruptcy court hearings on a proposal to allow <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to buy most of ailing <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for more than $ 85 million were adjourned for one week, a <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> lawyer said Wednesday. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> said all pending matters will be taken up in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next Wednesday. He declined to discuss details of a hearing Wednesday or the proposal, citing an agreement on a news blackout reached last month. A <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> newspaper reported this week that details of the plan in Avon-based <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s 10-month-old bankruptcy case were still being negotiated. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, declined Wednesday to discuss the plan, but said he expected an announcement would be made soon. `` We continue to work inside the bankruptcy court,'' he said. `` We would imagine that something will happen soon. However, we do not anticipate at this point making an announcement.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment. On Tuesday, an estimated $ 200,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s surplus furniture, office machines and manufacturing equipment was auctioned off, symbolizing the demise of the company that introduced Cabbage Patch Kids dolls. The sale, conducted by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> auction house in a warehouse adjacent to <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s Avon offices, was held to help the foundering toy manufacturer reduce its equipment in storage and raise cash to stay alive. But unnamed sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION> the plan to sell most of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s assets to the <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION>, R.I.-based <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> will likely mean the disappearance of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> and loss of the remaining 150 jobs. The Courant said the deal would involve selling most of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s assets to <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>, ending <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s 57 years as an independent company Sources told the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s committee of unsecured creditors would drop a $ 71 million lawsuit against the company's largest creditors, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessmen <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlmutter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marden </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlmutter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marden </PERSON>, in turn, would reduce their $ 80 million claim against <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit contends that <PERSON> Perlmutter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marden </PERSON> cheated <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> out of millions of dollars through a complex scheme of trading television advertising time for products. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> grew to be one of the nation's largest toy companies in the past decade but demand for its Cabbage Patch Kids dolls wanted and new products did n't make up lost sales. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> had debts of $ 540.3 million when it filed for bankruptcy last July. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s first reorganization plan, filed in January, was rejected by the creditors' committee. In March, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> said it was considering selling the company outright. But several weeks later <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> said it would instead propose a new reorganization plan offering a larger repayment to creditors. The company had not filed that new plan when creditors announced April 19 they had negotiated a deal to sell most of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> for more than $ 85 million in cash.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said Wednesday the imminent sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s prized Northeast shuttle was critical to his plan to restructure the strikebound carrier and would give the plan further momentum. `` Without the shuttle sale, you can forget about our alternatives,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> shortly before a federal bankruptcy judge approved a deal to sell the shuttle to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. `` The shuttle is the most easily salable, separable asset of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> approved in principle <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 365 million offer for the shuttle Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> withdrew a higher offer for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Washington-Boston </ORGANIZATION> shuttle after deciding it could n't meet a 5 p.m. deadline set by Eastern to arrange financing for the purchase. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors on March 9, five days after its Machinists union struck. Pilots and flight attendants have honored the walkout, forcing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to cut back its flight schedule by around 90 percent. The federal bankruptcy court must approve any sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets. The shuttle was Eastern's only consistently profitable operation before the strike. Eastern's unions wanted the airline sold as a single entity. But <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> sought to sell the shuttle and another $ 1.4 billion or so of the airline's assets separately and rebuild as a smaller carrier. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said the sale of the shuttle would give momentum to his plan to reshape Eastern. He said he believes <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> _ who has repeatedly urged that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> resume flying at full strength _ is leaning toward approving the restructuring plan. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> -RRB- is now gradually ... realizing that nobody out there is going to invest the hundreds of millions of dollars that are now necessary to bring this airline up'' in its original form, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. Under Eastern's plan, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would be rebuilt as a smaller carrier `` that is concentrated on more protected markets'' such as <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and destinations in the Northeast. Several potential suitors have approached <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> about buying all of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, but the company has not received any proposals it considered viable. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> indicated <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> had an edge over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in the shuttle fight, partly because the <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> deal was `` certainty'' while details of the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> bid such as financing remained up in the air up through the deadline. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> also called Trump the logical owner for the shuttle because he was `` willing to pay for the franchise value.'' `` The shuttle is a diamond,'' he said. `` Anybody who's willing to look at the Plaza Hotel and pay the price for that as a diamond, is going to look at our Plaza Hotel, which is the shuttle. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought the landmark <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> hotel for $ 395 million about a year ago. `` If somebody were to buy -LRB- the shuttle -RRB- just based on earnings, you would have a hard time with $ 365 million,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, saddled with $ 1.1 billion in debt and struggling to avoid bankruptcy, reached agreement with a dissident investor Wednesday that ended a proxy fight. <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> agreed to add <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, developer and real estate investor, and two associates to an expanded board of directors. Parks had first sought to gain control of the company from chairman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. He had complained that <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> was incapable of managing the troubled financial services company as it tried to recover from losses suffered mainly because of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' real estate depression and thrift troubles. Although <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> had first sought to replace <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>'s entire seven-member board with his own nominees, he was forced to cut back to three nominees because of federal regulations governing thrifts owned by <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our concern from the start has been to ensure that <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> is managed for the best interest of all its shareholders,'' said <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, who owns about 4.5 percent of the Dallas-based company's outstanding common stock `` This agreement satisfies us that that will be the case,'' <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> said in a joint statement with <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. The three nominees will be seated immediately on <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>'s board, which will be expanded from seven to 10 members The management team will remain unchanged. Parks also agreed not to seek control of the company or to participate in a proxy battle for at least two years. In return, <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> agreed to reimburse the <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> an unspecified amount for certain expenses. <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> last month reported a $ 1.04 billion quarterly loss, due mainly to an $ 829 million writedown of its real estate assets. The company said the loss left the company with a negative $ 428 million in stockholders' equity and placed it in default on $ 1.1 billion worth of mainly high-yield bonds issued to build up its portfolio. Bondholders could begin proceedings to force the liquidation of the company, but so far have declined to do so. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said the company will begin meeting with bondholders June 7 to discuss the company's restructuring. <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> pays about $ 30 million in interest on the bonds each quarter and so far has made all its payments, spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiter </PERSON> said. The next payment is due July 15, and Ms. <PERSON> Seiter </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>'s board has not decided whether it will be able to make that payment. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> announced an agreement in principle to sell its 89 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Integon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, its largest insurance subsidiary, for $ 135.5 million. In the past few months, the company also has sold off other holdings for a total of $ 167 million, all but $ 7 million in cash.
