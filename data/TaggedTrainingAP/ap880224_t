<HEAD>Police Officers Guilty in Queens Stun Gun Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former police sergeant and a suspended officer were convicted Wednesday of torturing a drug suspect with an electric stun gun three years ago. In addition, a former officer was convicted of beating of the man at his home, and a suspended lieutenant was found guilty of abetting the beating. The defendants were among several police officers from the same <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> precinct implicated in 1985 in the alleged torture of drug suspects with the stun gun, which delivers a powerful, temporarily disabling jolt of up to 40,000 volts. <PERSON> Everton </PERSON> <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> had testified that four officers beat him in his home in 1985, and that two of them had later used a stun gun on him at the station, holding him down and giving him shocks from the hand-held device. The 34-year-old taxi driver testified that the stun gun was used on his abdomen seven to 10 times for five seconds at a time. He has also filed a $ 50 million lawsuit against the city and the Police Department. Former Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> and suspended Officer <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> MacCary </PERSON> were convicted of assault, official misconduct and coercion and could receive up to seven years in prison. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, a former officer, was convicted of the same charges in the beating. Suspended Lt. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheswick </PERSON>, who supervised the other three, was convicted of official misconduct and faces up to a year in jail. The jury had begun deliberating Monday afternoon. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> was found guilty in both the beating and the stun gun attack; <PERSON> MacCary </PERSON> was convicted in the stun gun attack; and <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was found guilty in the beating. <PERSON> Cheswick </PERSON>, prosecutors said, had blocked <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON>'s wife from aiding her husband during the beating and had not tried to stop the beating. The four defendants will be sentenced March 29. The trial was the second of four scheduled for officers of the 106th precinct who allegedly tortured suspects with stun guns in 1985. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> already are serving two to six years for their convictions in the first trial, in 1986.

<HEAD>Senate Filibuster Over Campaign Spending Limits Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 2 grafs after 2nd graf pvs, bgng: ``The talking ...''
to UPDATE with motion to arrest absent senators.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> launched a `` full-fledged filibuster'' Tuesday as Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> ordered 24-hour sessions to subdue <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opposition to a Democratic campaign financing bill. The talking, broken by occasional roll calls, began about 2 p.m. and continued into the night. Appointments were canceled, schedules revised, senators began catching up on paperwork and cots were set up in rooms near the chamber. Shortly after 11 p.m., the Democrats used their numbers to approve a rarely-used motion ordering the sergeant-at-arms to take to the streets to arrest senators who had been absent from a series of quorum calls. Democrats said the move was made because Republicans were taking turns holding the floor, forcing Democrats to stay close by the chamber to prevent the loss of a quorum, which would immediately end the session. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, lacking the votes to prevent Republicans from stalling action on the legislation, threatened to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in session indefinitely. `` We've decided we'll just go around-the-clock,'' the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democrat said at midafternoon after <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic negotiators reported making no progress on the central question of spending limits. `` We're going to talk or we're going to vote,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, warning that foes of the campaign finance legislation would have to keep control of the floor to prevent a vote. Democrats and Republicans have been at loggerheads for nearly a year over a Democratic bill with 52 co-sponsors that would set up a system of voluntary spending limits for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> general election campaigns. The limit would be from $ 950,000 to $ 5.5 million, depending on a state's population. The bill's supporters say limits are needed to put a brake on the increasing cost of getting elected, up from an average of $ 600,000 in 1976 to $ 3 million in 1986. In larger states, growing numbers of candidates are spending more than $ 10 million to win a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, with increasing amounts of campaign funds being supplied by special-interest political action committees. A candidate observing the voluntary limit would get campaign funds from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> if the opponent exceeded the limit or an independent group spent large amounts of money against the candidate. Republicans, who have made opposition to limits a party issue, succeeded last year in preventing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from voting on the legislation, winning a record seven cloture votes during 22 days of floor time. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, even with the support of three of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 46 Republicans, is believed to be five votes short of the 60 needed to cut off debate and force a vote on the bill. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is in a full-fledged filibuster,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, adding that he would no longer confine debate to daylight hours. `` There's no point in continuing the casual, gentlemanly, good-guy filibuster because it will just turn out like it did last year,'' he said. ... Let's have it on the floor where the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people can see it.'' Four Democrats and four Republicans have been negotiating since last week. They reported progress on some facets of the bill but not on spending limits, which Republicans say will discriminate against them in states with a heavy Democratic edge in registered votes. The chief negotiators said their positions on the key issue were solid. A limit on spending `` is something this side is not going to agree to,'' said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky. `` That is not one of the negotiable items. His counterpart, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., was just as adamant: `` Any bill that does not limit campaign spending would not be real reform. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said, however, that Democrats are willing to discuss higher spending limits in states where their party enjoys a big advantage in registration or historically has dominated congressional elections. There was no public response from <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, who said Republicans were willing to discuss compromise on another Democratic demand: putting a ceiling on how much money a candidate can get from political action committees. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said negotiators had neared informal agreement on other issues, including controling how much personal money a millionare can put into his or her campaign; requiring broadcasters to charge rock-bottom rates for political ads; better disclosure of money going to political parties; and getting controls on so-called `` soft money,'' which includes groups like labor unions supplying people to help candidates with canvassing and phone banks.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is taking the bullock-cart into the 21st century. At least 500 researchers in about a dozen government-aided institutes are at work modernizing the ancient, creaking, plodding carts, and even the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has donated funds. Carts of various shapes and designs, made of plastic and aluminum, are being tested or have been developed. `` There is nothing funny about our project,'' said <PERSON> Mittar </PERSON> <PERSON> Pal </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhir </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` For us, animal-drawn carts are of great importance.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has an estimated 13 million bullock carts drawn by about 26 million of the neutered bulls, along with 2 million carts pulled by water buffaloes, camels, horses, mules and donkeys. The carts are seen most often in villages, where about 640 million of the <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people live. But they also are seen on major highways and an estimated 3 million plod along city streets, often slowing engine-powered traffic and infuriating motorists. <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> carts have even been used to pull MiG fighter jets to parades and earth satellites to launching pads. <PERSON> Dhir </PERSON> said it would be 50 years before <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> could eliminate animal-drawn carts, given their crucial role in Indian life. Capital investment in animal-drawn carts is put at $ 7.6 billion. More than 20 million Indians earn their living by driving, renting, and repairing the carts. `` The figure is striking given the fact that Indian railways, the fourth largest in the world, employ only 16.3 million people,'' said <PERSON> Rupinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, a mechanical engineer for the <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> has designed six types of bullock cart for field trials. Each year, animal-drawn carts move 14.4 million ton-miles of freight. Dhir estimates that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s animal-drawn carts provide about 40 million horse-power, equal to about 320,000 medium-duty trucks used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as city delivery vehicles. Without bullock carts, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> also would have had to import an additional 6 million tons of fuel each year. It now imports 17 million tons of crude oil annually. One of the innovations is the replacement of the carts' wooden-spoke wheels with pneumatic tires Engineer <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said carts with pneumatic tires can pull 2.5 tons of weight against the maximum capacity of 1.5 tons for conventional carts. Researchers in the southern state of <LOCATION> Karnataka </LOCATION> also have come up with plastic bullock carts, and in neighboring <LOCATION> Andhra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state a tire company has produced carts of lightweight aluminum. Another idea behind non-wooden carts is to reduce demand for lumber. An estimated 165,000 medium-sized trees are felled each year to make conventional carts. `` So you see, there is a solid logic behind metal carts,'' said <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>. He listed other reasons for updating the carts. `` We want to increase tillage and output, reduce damage to roads and injury to animals so that the poor animals can have a longer lifespan,'' he said. To protect the animals, curved and padded yokes are being introduced. Studies have shown that some draft animals' lives are cut short by cancerous infections on the neck from unpadded and uncurved yokes. Reflectors are being added as another safety feature. Other new fittings are <PERSON> bush </PERSON> bearings, cast-iron springs, shock absorbers, draw bars that adjust for animals of different height, and mud scrappers. A fodder box can be put on carts that go long distances. As for road damage, director <PERSON> Dhir </PERSON> said the biggest culprit is wooden wheels. `` In monetary terms the annual damage is to the tune of 7,000 million rupees -LRB- $ 538 million -RRB- to the roads,'' he said. Farmers seem to like the idea of improving bullock carts. `` It is an excellent idea,'' said <PERSON> Jhandu </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Jharsa </LOCATION>, a village 30 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` But this should have had been done 25 years ago. We have suffered for long, and so did the animals.'' Officials, too, say the new carts are catching on, but this itself is creating problems. `` We do not have enough new types of carts for all,'' said <PERSON> Kalle </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, project economist of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jharsa </LOCATION>, whose office received only 16 new carts. `` There are more than 200 claimants. Even some gypsies saw the carts and were attracted. They wanted at least one. I told them no. These are for farmers.'' Another reason for high demand is that the government is subsidizing the price by about 35 percent. It is estimated that the largest of the old wooden carts costs the equivalent of about $ 300. Newer wooden carts, without the government subsidy, cost $ 270 to $ 460. The plastic and aluminum carts are 25 percent more expensive.

 The town that was <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s civil war haven in remote northwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is struggling to catch up with a revolution that left it behind when the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership marched out 40 years ago to triumph. The caves <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> called home in <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>'s arid mountains are preserved much as he left them, the spartan desks and bedstands still in place. Since then, <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>'s population has grown from 10,000 to 80,000, and a smattering of eight - and 10-story concrete apartment blocks give the town an urban air But the lives of most of its residents have changed little compared with the rest of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Two-thirds of <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>'s people still live in caves in the steep brown cliffs overlooking two narrow rivers that meet at <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>. The cave-dwellers fetch water from nearby wells and grind their grain using old-style millstones turned by donkey or by hand. They cook on coal stoves that also heat the family sleeping platform, the kang. The caves have electricity, but few people have major electrical appliances. The average annual per capita income of <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>'s peasants is $ 59 _ less than half the national average and barely above the official poverty level of $ 54. Non-peasants average $ 108 a year, compared with a national figure of $ 248. The Communist revolution was intended to free the peasants from the whims of nature and those in power. But in <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>, nature has been stingy and those in power are far away. `` We rely on heaven for food,'' said <PERSON> Lei </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhifu </PERSON>, a former guerrilla leader and retired <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official, quoting an ancient saying about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s dependence on nature. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, who arrived here in 1937 at the end of the Long March, a 6,000-mile retreat from <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s Nationalist troops, left <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION> in 1947 as the country's civil war raged. He never returned. Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON> returned briefly in 1973, to attend the opening of a revolutionary museum. He ordered that small factories be set up with central government help to supplement the perennially drought-stricken area's meager agricultural income. The factories were built: fertilizer, steel, cement and textiles among others. But nothing was done to ensure that their products reached markets. Only one narrow, twisting road and three weekly flights link <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION> to the outside world. The nearest big city, <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, is more than 185 miles to the south, an eight-hour trip by car. Since 1985, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has moved to end <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>'s isolation by providing more than $ 54 million toward construction of a railroad. Tracks have been laid nearly halfway from <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>, and plans are to finish by 1990. There's a snag _ $ 43 million more is needed to build the final stretch. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Guanhua </PERSON>, deputy director of <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>'s planning commission, said he expected <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to provide at least part. Even with a railroad, <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s plans for <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>'s future are modest. He envisioned gradual growth fueled by wider sales for the town's factories, especially its leading industry, cigarettes <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Derong </PERSON>, the cigarette factory's deputy director, said they'll double production to 64 million packs a year once the railroad is finished The workers earn an average of $ 405 a year, making them the best paid in town. But the railroad is unlikely to help the 200-employee match factory next door, already hard hit by competition from larger, mechanized factories elsewhere. It shut down for 10 months last year because it had no money to buy wood for matches. <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION> officials finally loaned it $ 27,000 _ enough to reopen but not to buy modern machinery that would make it competitive. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, state-owned factories that lose money are being closed or leased to entrepreneurs under top leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s decade-old program to stimulate the economy and reduce central controls. But <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said `` no one in <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION> has enough money'' to lease the match factory. And it ca n't be shut, officials said, because the workers need the jobs. <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>'s agriculture also needs massive investment, in the form of irrigation canals, to significantly raise production. With less than 16 inches of rain annually, yields are less than half those in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s lush southeast. No efforts are made to encourage the one industry for which <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION> is historically equipped: tourism. More than 50 hotels are under construction in <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> alone as part of a nationwide tourism boom, but <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION> offers only five small guest houses. <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, site of the ancient city of Chang-an, is known for its temples and tombs. Its biggest attraction is the thousands of life-size terra cotta warriors built more than 2,000 years ago to guard the tomb of Emperor <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> <PERSON> Huangdi </PERSON>, who united <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Of the 80,000 visitors to <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s old headquarters every year, only about 500 are foreigners, who bring far more money than Chinese. <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>'s dust-covered streets are uninviting and things are sleepy. Even a confirmed Marxist like <PERSON> Lei </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhifu </PERSON> said he attends ceremonies at the local <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temple `` for excitement.''

 A judge in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> makes some convicts buy newspaper ads to apologize. Slumlords in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are sentenced to live in their own buildings. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, executives convicted of securities violations are ordered to read up on ethics, and write reports. Such innovations are sometimes motivated by overflowing jails, but in other cases are intended to tailor the punishment to the crime. On Tuesday, for instance, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> sentenced a white man convicted of threatening blacks to do 200 hours of community service with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assocaition </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` He's going to learn how to be a responsible human being,'' <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON> said in sentencing <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON>, 22, who was part of a group of whites and Hispanics who menaced two blacks with baseball bats and bottles last year. Last month, <LOCATION> Anne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arundel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> joined a growing number of jurisdictions that are using electronic gadgets to enforce non-jail sentences. The county's program for repeat drunken driving offenders calls for them to continue working, but turn over one-fourth of their pay to the county and spend their free time exclusively at home. To make sure they do, television cameras are installed in the homes, and a jailer calls at random times to make sure the subject is at home. `` There simply is n't enough room in the detention center to lock everyone up,'' explains District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, who envisions expanding the program to include those convicted of drug abuse, petty thievery or battery. `` The obvious selling point is the cost,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinter </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The Dallas-based firm contracts with government agencies to operate monitoring systems, and charges $ 7 per case per day. Program Monitor has only 45 cases in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> now and is n't making money, <PERSON> Grinter </PERSON> said Tuesday, but he said a state commission estimated in 1986 that as many as 6,000 prisoners might be suitable for electronic monitoring. Program Monitor provided the hardware to monitor a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> landlord, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, who was convicted of multiple building violations and sentenced to live in one of his buildings in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. He was released last week after spending eight days in his newly plastered and painted apartment in the rundown building. A similar sentence was imposed last year on Dr. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Avol </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> neurosurgeon convicted of numerous violations in buildings he owned. In other recent cases: _ Multimillionaire industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, who pleaded no contest to evading more than $ 1.2 million in federal taxes, was sentenced on Feb. 12 to work 5,000 hours of community service over the next five years. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> also ordered the 69-year-old financier to pay $ 4 million in back taxes and penalties, and contribute $ 3 million to programs for the homeless. The maximum sentence for the conviction was in excess of 40 years in prison. `` At your age, I doubt you'd be in jail more than six to nine months regardless of the sentence,'' <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said. _ A city judge in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, ordered a man convicted of destroying a newspaper vending box to spend the next month guarding its replacement <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 25, was sentenced to stand watch from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. for 30 days. _ Last September, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, sentenced four former executives of a collapsed securities brokerage to read six books about suffering and afflicted people and submit reports after serving prison terms of up to 2 -LCB- years. The executives had pleaded guilty to charges in connection with the collapse of <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bresler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Schulman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. They testified against a fifth executive, who was convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison. Among the assigned books were <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s `` The Grapes of Wrath,'' biographies of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, and `` Working Your Way to the <LOCATION> Botton </LOCATION> _ The Feminization of Poverty.'' _ In <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, District Attorney <PERSON> Ulys </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> began a program two years ago requiring convicts to apologize for their crimes in community newspapers. One of the first ads was placed by a former sheriff's detective convicted of possessing a controlled substance. Sometimes the experiments do n't pan out. District Judge <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, gained national attention when she sentenced child molester <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> to post signs on his house and car warning, `` Dangerous Sex Offender. No Children Allowed.'' <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, 47, later dropped out of sight for three weeks, was rearrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> won an `` innovation in government'' award from the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> last year in recognition of its comprehensive program to provide alternatives to jail time. The state has about 18,500 prison inmates, but 109,000 other convicts have been placed in programs ranging from basic probation to boot camp-style life in a diversion center, to 90-day `` shock incarceration'' for offenders aged 17 to 25. Shock incarceration is intended convince violators who have n't been in prison before that they do n't want to come back A study in 1986 found that 23 percent of those who went through shock incarceration committed further crimes, compared to 22 percent for the general prison population, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, coordinator of the state's diversion programs. `` At first blush you are prone to say there is no appreciable difference,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said Tuesday, `` but the other way of looking at it is that we can give someone a 90-day prison experience, as opposed to an experience that may last for years, and do no worse.'' In other words, the state gets the same results for less money. In the diversion centers, where the state can accommodate up to 750 people, prisoners work during the day, and pay $ 6.50 a day for board and room. Thus, the state's cost is $ 27.50 a day, compared to $ 37 day for each prison inamte, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. The state also has an intenive probation program, in which probationers have to meet four times a week with an officer. That program is self-supporting, because judges may impose fees up to $ 50 a month as part of the sentence, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. In 1982, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, 63 percent of criminal convicts in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> received a probated sentence. In 1985, that had increased to 73 percent. `` If you look at 1981, the state of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> had the highest per-capita incarceration rate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It exceeded the incarceration rate of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the Union of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We began putting our emphasis on alternative programs in 1982, and by 1985 we had dropped down to No. 11 in per-capita incarceration rates.'' `` The real issue now,'' he emphasized, `` is that we can not afford to build any more prisons.''

 Two men were dead; valuable manuscripts had changed hands; false names were involved. The mystery was solved Tuesday as <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> announced that it had been given the papers of <PERSON> Ellery </PERSON> <PERSON> Queen </PERSON>, the dashing, upper-crust detective whose adventures helped elevate American detective fiction to an art form. <PERSON> Ellery </PERSON> <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> was created by Brooklyn-born cousins <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who entered a 1928 mystery contest that required a pseudonym. They invented <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> and made him both author and protagonist, thinking an author would be better remembered if his name appeared throughout the book. More than 40 <PERSON> Ellery </PERSON> <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> novels were written before <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> died in 1971. His partner, <PERSON> Dannay </PERSON>, died in 1982, and <PERSON> Dannay </PERSON>'s sons <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> gave the <PERSON> Ellery </PERSON> <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> papers to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The manuscripts show that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dannay </PERSON> often were at odds over their work, with intense disagreements and personality clashes. There are extensive revisions; in one case, 50 pages were deleted from a novel. `` We're not so much collaborators as competitors. It has produced a sharper edge,'' <PERSON> Dannay </PERSON> once said. The 25,000-item collection includes the only surviving manuscript of the first <PERSON> Ellery </PERSON> <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> novel, `` The Roman Hat Mystery,'' and the notes, outlines and corrected manuscripts of the last, `` A Fine and Private Place.'' Also included are letters and manuscripts of <PERSON> Dashiell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammett </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woolrich </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, <PERSON> Agatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> and others whose work already can be found in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s archive of mystery and detective writing. The <PERSON> Ellery </PERSON> <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> novels led to a series of movies, radio and television shows, and to <PERSON> Ellery </PERSON> <PERSON> Queen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mystery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>, which first appeared in 1941 and is still published monthly. The <PERSON> Ellery </PERSON> <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> archives include the first issue of the magazine, along with manuscripts from such contributors as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>. Selections from the archives will be on exhibit at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s Butler Library from March 3 to July 6

 Repeat drunken drivers convicted in a new program are being allowed to keep their jobs, but as soon as the whistle blows they must go home, stay home and stay sober. Big brother will be watching, and calling. <LOCATION> Anne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arundel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has invested $ 15,000 in 30 video monitoring systems, which are installed in offenders' homes and linked by telephone lines to a master control in the county jail. Under the program launched Jan. 26, offenders are not watched all the time, but they never know when a jail officer will call and ask them to step before the camera. `` A lot of people say I got off easy, but you're stopped in your tracks at the front door,'' said one of the first four men sentenced under the program, a three-time offender who agreed to be interviewed on condition his name not be used. `` It's not exactly a slap on the wrist, but it's better than sitting in jail.'' For this offender, the hardest part of the program is turning over $ 336 a month _ one-fourth of his salary _ to the county during his 90-day sentence. `` It's a big dent in our pocket,'' said his wife. An operator at the the jail dials each offender once, and often twice, a night and instructs him to turn on the video equipment and stand in front of the camera. The county also has purchased hand-held breath analyzers to make sure the offender is complying with a judge's no-drinking stipulation. The equipment displays alcohol levels in bright red numerals that can be read over the TV monitor. House detainees also are required to turn over one-quarter of their take-home pay to the county. If an offender's home does n't have an adequate telephone jack, he has to pay for one Violation of any condition brings a jail sentence. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellers </PERSON>, government marketing coordinator for <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, said the VisiTel system has been used in several states to monitor probationers, but he said <LOCATION> Anne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arundel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is apparently the first to use the system as an alternative to prison sentences. At least 11 manufacturers are marketing systems, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. The program has been endorsed by the local chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Heald </PERSON>, president of the group, said that when the program is combined with an alcohol counseling program it may help make highways safer. `` We're hopeful. Sending them to jail we know does n't work,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Heald </PERSON>, who said the program is in keeping with a philosophy of `` punishment for the crime, treatment for the disease and monitoring for the citizen.'' County officials plan to review the program in the next few weeks and decide whether to buy 90 additional monitors this smmer. District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> drug users, petty thieves and those convicted of minor battery charges are also likely candidates for house detention. Asked if he expects public opposition, <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> was frank: `` Are you kidding? Nothing is ever tough enough for them. But I have to live in the real world.'' House detention is an alternative to paying up to $ 40 a day to keep a prisoner in the county jail, as well as putting off the cost of constructing new prisons. `` There simply is n't enough room in the detention center to lock everyone up,'' said <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>. Electronically enforced home-detention programs have expanded rapidly since the first reported test in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, in 1983. As of last February, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, 53 house-detention programs in 21 states electronically monitored more than 800 offenders. Most programs rely on electronic bracelets that signal when an offender has strayed from home. The institute reported that offenders in such programs tended to be males under the age of 30. About one-third were convicted of serious traffic violations, particularly drunken driving. Another large category included parolees and probationers.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> on Tuesday denounced as `` complete nonsense'' a memo that described plans to funnel millions of dollars to his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for assurances that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not bomb a proposed Iraqi pipeline. The 1985 memo, made public Monday, was addressed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and written by <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend and lawyer for Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a partner in the pipeline project. The $ 1 billion pipeline was to have carried oil from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to the Gulf of <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION>, but was never built. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials `` all agreed that we favored the laying of the pipeline. So why would anyone need to use bribes?'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told reporters during a tour of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city. `` I do n't understand this.'' However, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> through a spokesman in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> acknowledged Tuesday that the Israeli government had been offered a discount on oil purchases amounting to $ 65 million to $ 70 million a year in return for approving the pipeline, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Wednesday's editions. But the aide said that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> did not take the offer seriously and failed to pass it on to colleagues, the newspaper said. He said the offer was made by <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> but there was no proposal for paying part of the discount to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' party, the Post reported. An Israeli military analyst on Tuesday told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> it would not have been in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s interest to destroy the pipeline because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has sought a dialogue with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to counter growing hostility from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The memo said <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> `` confirmed the arrangement with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to the effect that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will receive somewhere between $ 65 million and $ 70 million a year for 10 years out of the conclusion of the project.'' `` What also was indicated to me,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, `` and which would be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly to Labor.'' The memo is central to a criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. At issue is whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> knew of a possibly improper payment plan involving the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and, if so, why he did nothing about it. In a handwritten note from <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, also made public Monday, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader said of the pipeline project: `` I would go a long way to help it out. But then discretion is demanded on our part.'' Asked about the Wallach-Meese memo, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said: `` No one said he gave the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> anything or proposed anything to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. As far as I'm concerned, it's complete nonsense.'' Earlier, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> aide close to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` Mr. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> did not see a penny out of this, and neither did the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We repeatedly have denied the whole story,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` No money was offered to Mr. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and if it had been, he would have thrown the man out the window.'' Another ministry official told The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that several <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers privately discussed the pipeline project, but no decision about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s position was ever made. <PERSON> Dore </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, a researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said bombing the project would not have been in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s interest, but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> probably `` sought as many assurances as possible regarding a pipeline that would come so close to Israeli borders.'' <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has sought to open a dialogue with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to counter growing hostility from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> following that country's 1979 Islamic fundamentalist revolution. For example, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> several years ago made an offer to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to reactivate a pipeline built in the 1930s from the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> city <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. Gold said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> never responded to the offer. But <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytan </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> researcher, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had good reason to oppose the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> pipeline because it would have turned the Jordanian city of <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION> into an oil port and destroyed the economic base of the neighboring <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> resort Elat. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytan </PERSON>: `` We need this like we need stones in the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories.''

<HEAD>Judge: Adventists, Others Can Cast Absentee Ballots In Saturday
Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLARKSBURG, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People who observe the Sabbath on Saturdays have the right to cast absentee ballots in elections held on Saturdays, a federal judge ruled. In a case arising from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s March 5 constitutional amendment election, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday in favor of two Seventh-day Adventists who had been told they could not submit absentee ballots for the Saturday voting. The ruling also affects Jews, Seventh-day Baptists, and members of other religious groups who believe that they should not participate in any civic, business, governmental or non-essential work on Saturdays. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, school bus drivers in <LOCATION> Barbour </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, contended that because of their religious beliefs, they were being deprived of their right to vote on a proposed amendment that would establish a statewide property tax for education. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> usually holds elections on Tuesdays, but moved this one to Saturday in hopes of boosting turnout. The election was set after a state court ruled that the state must equalize spending among school systems. The Conners were told by the secretary of state's office that they did not qualify for absentee voting under state law. They then filed suit in state court against Secretary of State <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hechler </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Barbour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clerk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month refused to hear the case, so the <PERSON> Conners </PERSON> took it to the federal court. <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Hechler </PERSON> to submit by Friday a plan `` outlining measures to be taken to ensure that plaintiffs and members of this class are permitted to vote in the forthcoming election.''

 <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Loyd </PERSON>, who plays the grandfatherly Dr. <PERSON> Auschlander </PERSON> in television's `` St. Elsewhere,'' has joined a hospital's drive to recruit nurses. `` I must say this is a little nicer than St. Elsewhere,'' the fictional inner-city <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> hospital featured in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> series, <PERSON> Loyd </PERSON> observed Tuesday as he walked down the corridor at <LOCATION> Heartland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` I think I'll ask them to change the set.'' <PERSON> Loyd </PERSON> will star in a 10-minute video to be distributed nationwide in <LOCATION> Heartland </LOCATION>'s search for nursing personnel. He took time between takes to shake hands with Heartland employees. `` Having him in it will be an attention getter _ something we hope will catch the eye of nurses who might be looking for a position,'' said <PERSON> Debi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yancer </PERSON>, associate director of patient care services. The video will be shown at career days, placement fairs and at recruitment dinners that have been spurred by the nationwide shortage of nurses.

 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has swept to victory and ratings gold with its coverage of the Winter Olympics. Its Olympic telecasts for the week that ended Sunday captured four of the top 10 place in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings and won the week for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> also moved ahead of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and into first place for the February sweeps and into second place ahead of CBS for the season-to-date. It kept its first-place position among the evening news shows. The `` CBS Evening News,'' which had dominated that category for the entire season until last week, finished second. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, whose eight-hour miniseries `` Noble House'' managed to win only 16th place, was second for the week. Its highly rated comedy shows did well, but were pushed down a few notches by the Olympics. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, which usually takes third place, won the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings for the week with an average of 19.4. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was second with 15.0 and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was third with 12.8. For the season-to-date, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> now has a 16.3 rating, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 13.8, CBS 13.6. The rating is the percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with televisions. It was only <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s third weekly victory of the season, which began in September. It won on Super Bowl and World Series weeks. Last week's top 10 shows were: <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Tuesday Olympics; <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show''; <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Saturday Olympics; <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World''; CBS' `` 60 Minutes''; <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers''; <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Wednesday Olympics; CBS' `` Murder, She Wrote''; <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Thursday Olympics; and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Family Ties'' and `` ALF,'' which tied <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was ahead in this month's <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> sweeps ratings. The sweeps are periods during which the ratings of the nation's television stations are measured. The <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has fewer stations than the three other commercial networks, also got good news. Its `` 21 Jump Street'' had its highest rating to date with 6.6, placing it ahead of the three lowest-rated network shows. `` Married With Children'' got a 5.7 rating, its highest ever, coming in higher than the two bottom network shows. `` Werewolf'' got its highest rating ever in its 8 p.m. time period, 5.1, which would give it a tie with the networks' lowest-rated show.

 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents illegally interrogated a suspected Lebanese terrorist about a 1985 airplane hijacking when they kept him aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship four days after his arrest in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, a federal judge says. Sharply critical of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s arrest and interrogation of <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> on Tuesday ruled that oral and written confessions were obtained illegally from the defendant. The judge suppressed the statements as evidence against <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, who is charged with leading five armed men who hijacked a Royal Jordanian airliner on June 11, 1985, at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> International Airport. The trial is scheduled to begin March 22 before <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. The operation occurred after former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> had moved on to head the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and before <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>, the bureau's current head, took office last fall. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he was pleased with the decision but conceded it wo n't necessarily help <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>' case. Prosecutors have a variety of other evidence, including a videotape of <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> delivering a statement to reporters before the plane was blown up in the background. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, the bureau's executive assistant director, participated in the arrest of <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> last Sept. 13 in waters off <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> concluded that fractures <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> suffered on both wrists were sustained when he was grabbed by two agents and slammed onto the deck of an FBI-chartered yacht, to which he had been lured by the prospect of a drug deal. Throbbing pain from the fractured wrists, sea sickness and the lack of proper medical treatment `` placed him at a distinct disadvantage where he could scarcely understand intelligently his rights as explained and translated to him, much less be able to voluntarily waive them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents gave <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> the only warning of his constitutional right to remain silent shortly after he arrived seasick on the USS Butte, a munitions boat that steamed four days before meeting with the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> noted. `` They saw and knew that he was in a weakened state and susceptible to persuasion,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was kept in a windowless overheated room during the voyage, which <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> called `` a clear abuse of the obligation to bring the defendant before a judicial officer immediately following his arrest.'' The ship's `` slow voyage across the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> appeared to serve only the government's purposes _ ample time to educe a confession,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said in his 47-page opinion. Only after his arrival in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>' fractured wrists `` correctly diagnosed and appropriately treated,'' the judge said. `` We are reviewing the decision carefully,'' <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, principal assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment on the decision, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzer </PERSON>. The judge said he was also `` extremely troubled'' by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to provide <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> with a lawyer during the interrogation, particularly since the operation to arrest him had been carefully planned `` The government was not just bringing another defendant into the station house for questioning,'' he said, also criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for not using a video camera to record the interrogations. In addition to the videotape of <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> at the scene, the government also plans to present testimony from two Americans who were among the passengers and crew taken off the plane before its destruction. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also can rely on the testimony of <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>, a one-time friend of <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> who lured him onto the yacht. <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, secretly taped conversations he had with <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> about the hijacking.

 Now that a sculpture of three battle-weary infantrymen stands near the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial, some senators want to place a bronze statue of an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> nurse nearby to honor the 10,000 women who served in the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> conflict. Several leading veterans' organizations applaud the proposal by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif But <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, the young woman architect who designed the memorial, is n't happy. `` I can not see where it will all end,'' she said at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing Tuesday. `` What is to stop someone from trying to add a female statue to the Iwo Jima Memorial?'' Ms. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> was supported by others who warned that unless officials stop caving in to pressure for more additions, the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> memorial will turn into a `` sculpture garden'' of special interests ranging from native Americans to scout dogs. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> which rejected the women's statue proposal last October, said the original memorial _ now bearing the names of 58,156 war dead including eight nurses on its black granite walls _ symbolically includes all <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans. He said the addition of the sculpture of three infantrymen triggered envy among other groups who felt left out. His commission believed that `` including a white, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> nurse would only continue and exacerbate that process of exclusion,'' he said. At a crowded hearing by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doubek </PERSON>, former executive director of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, said a woman's sculpture would `` destroy the symbolism and aesthetics of the memorial.'' But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, chairman of the private fund which raised $ 11 million to build the memorial, supported the nurse's statue and discounted `` the threat of a sculpture garden'' cited by critics <PERSON> Donna-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulay </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> lawyer who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> nurse, testified that the statue should be erected because nurses shared `` the intensity, the trauma, the carnage of war'' with infantrymen. She is chairman and co-founder of the Vietnam Women's Memorial Project, a non-profit organization founded in 1984. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>'s bill, which has 56 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> co-sponsors, specifies that after a woman's statue is placed at the 2.2-acre site near the Lincoln Memorial, `` the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial will be complete and no further additions to the site should be authorized or undertaken.'' The bill, if enacted, would require the three agencies whose approval is required _ the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the fine arts commission and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> _ to reconsider the proposal within 90 days. The statue has been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> but rejected by the other two agencies. The memorial, which is administered by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, has become the most popular tourist attraction among all the federal monuments in the capital. An estimated 20 million people have visited the memorial since it was dedicated in 1982.

<HEAD>U.S. Falling Down on the Public Works Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s commitment to necessities such as transportation, water supply and waste disposal is barely adequate and will fall far short of future needs without sharply increased spending on public works, a federal council warned today. The report to the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> calls for twice as much annual capital spending for public works projects over the next dozen years and suggests a broad range of possible money sources from higher federal fuel taxes to local `` impact fees'' on developers. `` In most cases we can not rely simply on wiser spending. We also must generate additional sources of funding,'' declared the report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION>. The council was established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> four years ago to take a close look at the nation's problems with its `` infrastructure,'' a bureaucratic term covering a variety of public projects from highway and airport construction to water management and disposal of toxic wastes. `` The quality of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s infrastructure today is barely adequate to meet current requirements and insufficient to meet the demands of future economic growth,'' the report concludes. The group acknowledged that major increases in spending for public works may be difficult amid growing federal budget pressures, and perhaps even impossible until the federal budget deficit is reduced. But it said such spending `` must rank high among our priorities.'' In a report card on each major type of public works, the council gave no failing grades but suggested that a far better job needs to be done in all areas. The country's battle to deal with toxic wastes was given a D, and a C or C-minus was awarded for coping with mass transit, solid waste disposal and waste water treatment needs. Managing water resources was given a B, the best grade, followed by B-minuses for aviation and water supply management. `` In general the aviation system has handled rapid increases in demand safely and effectively. ... Congestion is the system's primary problem,'' said the council Discussing hazardous wastes, the council said that while spending to clean up contaminated sites has increased fivefold in the last two years, `` only a small fraction of the 2 tons of waste per capita produced in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> each year is being treated safely.'' On water quality, the council suggested that governments at all levels have been fighting a losing battle. `` Despite -LRB- a -RRB- $ 44 billion federal investment in sewage treatment since 1972, water quality has not improved significantly. ... due in part to uncontrolled sources of pollution such as run-off from farmland and roadways,'' said the report. Overall capital spending for public works projects totaled $ 45 billion in 1985, the latest year for which figures were available. The council said the amount of spending by all levels of government and the private sector will have to double by the end of this century if future needs are to be met. The report said overall spending on public works has declined from 3.6 percent of gross national product in 1960 to 2.6 percent in 1985. While spending on operations and maintenance has kept pace with economic growth, capital spending has fallen from 2.3 percent of GNP to 1.1 percent. Government spending for public works at all levels has declined from 20 percent of total government spending in 1950 to 7 percent in 1984, the report continued. `` In effect we're drawing down past investments without making commensurate investments of our own,'' said the report. `` Failure to reverse this decline will exact a high price for the nation in the future both in the cost of deferred investment and in reduced economic competitiveness.'' The council endorsed the `` general principle'' that users and beneficiaries of public works projects, including developers, be required to pay a greater share of the cost of such projects. It also criticized the hoarding of money in various federal public works trust funds so that the federal budget deficit will appear smaller. In 1987 the unspent balances in the federal highway, transit, aviation and waterway trust funds totaled nearly $ 24 billion, the council said. `` Federal user fees paid in good faith by beneficiaries to preserve and protect public works systems -LRB- should -RRB- be spent for that purpose,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they are receiving signs that Panamanian President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> may be ready to disassociate himself from military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Any such move would further weaken <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and possibly hasten his demise as the dominant force in Panamanian politics, the officials said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration looks upon <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as the principal obstacle blocking its goal of an eventual transition to elected, civilian-led rule in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The officials, who asked not to be identified, said <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has privately expressed his intention for many weeks to distance himself from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but they recognize that such a step would require considerable courage. `` We get information from all sorts of sources, including friends and relatives, that he is about to do something along these lines,'' one official said. Congressional sources, also insisting on anonymity, said they have heard the same reports. Since last summer, the administration has been publicly encouraging <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military officers to withdraw from politics as a means of promoting a return to rule by civilians. In the meantime, much of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid program to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been suspended and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has expelled all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid personnel. Two federal indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug trafficking charges added a new dimension to the already strained relationship. The indictments, handed down in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> earlier this month, portrayed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as a key member of an international drug smuggling conspiracy. In the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, opposition to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> spans the political spectrum. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> assumed the presidency in 1985 under circumstances which strongly suggested that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had forced his predecessor, <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardito </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON>, from office. It was a constitutional succession but <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has been widely perceived as no more than <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s titular head. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has maintained that executive authority rests with <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has achieved a full transition to democracy. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> critics are campaigning against him for the purpose of annulling the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, under which the waterway reverts to Panamanian control at the end of 1999. Attempts to obtain comment from the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s purported intentions were not successful. For the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the stakes in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are extraordinarily high. The administration believes that a democratic, politically stable <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> offers the best assurance for the continued efficient operation of the canal. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials noted that challenging <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would not be an easy step for <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. They said <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s extensive business interests and his family could be threatened if he breaks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In addition, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s health is said to be tenuous because of a heart operation. However, the officials said <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has become increasingly disturbed by his ties to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and that some of his friends have rebuffed him because of that association. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> also may be tempted to act because of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s growing financial crisis. `` The country is falling apart all around him,'' said one source. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabrega </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> diplomat who resigned recently in protest over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule, said in an interview this week that the country's financial problems are so severe the government may not be able to meet its payroll next month.

<HEAD>FBI Stung by Complaints of Vietnam-Era Spying</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stung by complaints that it revived Vietnam-era spying on political protesters, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has initiated top-level reviews of terrorism investigations that could interfere with legitimate activity. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday that the policy results from problems with an increasingly controversial investigation of a group opposing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policies. In that probe, some <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> field offices came `` very close'' to conducting an improper political investigation of the Committee In Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>, despite warnings from headquarters, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Executive Assistant Director <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>. While vigorously defending the legitimacy of the March 1983-June 1985 investigation, <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that neither he nor former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> _ now head of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> _ closely supervised the probe. The investigation ended without filing of any charges, but before it was completed <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents had collected information not only on <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> members but also more than a hundred other groups and individuals opposed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policies. Targets of the surveillance included <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nuns, college professors and labor union officials. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzer </PERSON> acknowledged to a reporter that the new reviews were `` related to'' the First Amendment concerns arising from the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> has ordered an internal investigation of the bureau's conduct specifically in the CISPES case. <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> has accused the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> of investigating its members solely because of its political stance, recalling <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> surveillance of opponents of the Vietnam War. The Vietnam-era surveillance came under intense congressional criticism in the 1970s and led to attorney general's guidelines intended to govern the bureau's investigative conduct. Tuesday, several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> they believe the bureau acted on flimsy evidence to keep the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation alive. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, complained that <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> was targeted for `` a nationwide dragnet-type operation'' while investigations of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> supporters were `` much more limited, more surgical.'' <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said `` we have taken interim steps to increase the level of review'' of sensitive investigations conducted under the largely classified guidelines for international terrorism probes. Under the new policy, Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzer </PERSON> said, the conduct of international terrorism investigations will be reviewed by a deputy assistant director who reports to <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> _ who has responsibility for all criminal investigations. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> told the senators that <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was `` aware of several cables sent to him for informational purposes'' in the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe, but `` he did not authorize, nor did I authorize any supervisory activity. That occurred at the sectional level'' three steps below <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> and <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> `` had a limited amount of knowledge'' of the CISPES investigation. International terrorism investigations _ such as the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> probe _ are conducted under guidelines which do not require the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to have evidence of a specific crime. In the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it had information that some <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> members were planning violent activities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, possibly in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> _ the coalition fighting the U.S.-backed government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The bureau characterizes the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> as a `` terrorist'' organization. The bureau also said <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> members were investigated after bombings at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McNair </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1983, although no evidence against them was found. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said much of the information that started and fueled the investigation came from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON>, a former informant in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> whose information proved to be a `` mixed bag ... some blatantly false, some concocted in his own mind.'' `` That did result in the investigation being misled in certain material facts,'' said <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, adding the bureau only discovered the problem `` after the fact.'' <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON> is now suing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, saying it still owes him money for his informant work. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> made a mistake when it disseminated _ under a `` secret'' classification _ derogatory information received about <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> from a conservative group. The information from the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> was sent to 33 field offices. `` I did not approve it or sign it,'' <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said. `` I would not have. ... It was inappropriate to indicate that the views of another organization should be considered by our investigators.''

<HEAD>War Of Words Escalates In Final Days of Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAKAR, Senegal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This West African nation votes for president and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday in a multiparty election, a rarity on a continent dominated by one-party and military governments. With only five days left until national elections, the war of words escalated Tuesday as four presidential candidates and six political parties wound up campaigning. Opposition politicians accused the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has ruled since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1960, of rigging Sunday's elections in advance and sending armed militias to break up opposition party gatherings The president and Socialist leader, <PERSON> Abdou </PERSON> <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON>, 52, a tall, angular technocrat, is widely expected to retain his seat and legislative majority. But young voters in some urban areas may back <PERSON> Abdoulaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, a 61-year-old lawyer who leads the <ORGANIZATION> Senegalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest opposition group. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> has called for change in the government's generally conservative, pro-Western policies. Tensions were high in the cities, where there have been sporadic student strikes and stone-throwing incidents between young supporters of the different parties. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>'s party has formed its own `` people's resistance committees'' to safeguard its meetings. `` We will mobilize our supporters to go to the polling stations,'' said <PERSON> Ousmane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngom </PERSON>, a party spokesman. `` If we see fraud, we will occupy the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> ministries to prevent them from announcing their fraudulent results. If we think we have the majority, we will declare victory and declare a new government.'' <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> said Monday the government was `` prepared to deal with all excesses,'' and there will be `` no liberty for the enemies of liberty.'' He has insisted the elections will be free, fair and democratic. <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> has governed the country since 1981, when he took over from retiring leader <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedar </PERSON> <PERSON> Senghor </PERSON>. Other candidates in the presidential race are <PERSON> Babacar </PERSON> <PERSON> Niang </PERSON>, 59, of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Landing </PERSON> <PERSON> Savane </PERSON>, 43, of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Niang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Savane </PERSON>, a Maoist, have both said they have little chance of winning and are participating to show there is an alternative to the Socialists. <PERSON> Serigne </PERSON> <PERSON> Diop </PERSON>, former <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> supporter and leader of the Senegalese <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renovation </ORGANIZATION>, backed <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON>'s candidacy but hoped to win legislative seats for his own party. The Marxist-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON> Abdoulaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bathily </PERSON>, 43, also offered only legislative candidates. In 1983, <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> retained the presidency and his party took 111 of the 120 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in the country's first multiparty elections. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> and other opposition politicians claimed that election was marred by fraud. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> has again accused the government of distributing voter registration cards through <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON>'s party rather than through independent registration committees. He also said the government radio, television and semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION> newspaper have given preferential coverage to Socialist candidates. Opposition politicians have criticized the country's austerity program, which is backed by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, but which has brought a reduction on civil service openings for university graduates and other belt-tightening measures. Earlier this month, four Senegalese gendarmes, two non-commissioned officers and three police sergeants were arrested on charges of plotting the secession of the <LOCATION> Casamance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>'s southernmost province Violent separatist demonstrations led by ethnic <PERSON> Diola </PERSON> agitators in the <LOCATION> Casamance </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Ziguinchor </LOCATION>, in December 1983, caused more than 100 deaths. Scores of ringleaders were later sentenced to long prison terms and the main secessionist association was outlawed. <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> has a population of 7 million. The largely agricultural nation has suffered from recurring droughts and the southern advance of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> desert. Its chief export is groundnuts.

 An admitted prostitute led a protest at the Capitol against a bill that would require AIDS tests for convicted prostitutes and their customers. `` Prostitutes are not spreading AIDS,'' <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> said Tuesday at a rally outside the capitol. She and about a dozen demonstrators accused lawmakers of making prostitutes the scapegoats in political battles over AIDS. `` Prostitutes use safe sex,'' said <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>. `` Do ordinary people use safe sex? No.'' `` We want -LRB- AIDS -RRB- education. We want to be able to do a good job,'' said <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>, a member of the prostitutes' rights group, Cast Off Your Old Tired Ethics -LRB- COYOTE -RRB-. The bill would require prostitutes and their customers to complete an education course and undergo screening for acquired immune deficiency syndrome after their first conviction. A vote on the bill is scheduled for next week.

 The Oil, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday rejected a proposed merger with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, just hours before the two unions were poised to announce the deal, officials said. `` There's a decision from <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> not to go forward,'' that union's spokesman, <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, said late Tuesday `` I do n't know that that sets everything in concrete. But that's where it stands for now.'' A news conference had been tentatively set for Wednesday to announce the merger, but the <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> backed out after meeting with <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> leaders most of Tuesday afternoon. The merger was intended to bolster the strength of the two energy workers' unions, whose memberships have been shrinking throughout the last decade. The <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection sent <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and his executive board members into a late-night meeting at a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> hotel. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> said only that `` a snag'' had come `` from the <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> side, not the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> board had voted Sunday in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to approve the merger, a union source said. It was not clear Tuesday night whether <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> officials would make any further offers to the <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said earlier Tuesday that a merger between the unions, which each claim about 100,000 active members, would be logical for several reasons, including `` consolidation of resources.'' `` Nowadays we -LRB- the two unions -RRB- are kind of in the posture of negotiating with the same companies, and that's because the major oil companies own the lion's share of the energy and coal reserves in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. A cooperative negotiating effort between the two unions was announced in 1986 at a special <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> constitutional convention attended by <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Misbrener </PERSON>. At that convention, the miners' union also gave <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and the union's 24-member governing board the power to approve affiliations or mergers with other unions. Before a merger could take effect, however, it would have to be approved by <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION>'s rank-and-file at a constitutional convention. The union's next regularly scheduled convention is in August. At the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 convention, <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> told delegates that the two unions would work to compile information on their common employers leading to their coincidental contract expiration date, Jan. 31, 1988. `` The two titans of the energy union movement, the Mine Workers and the <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION>, have agreed to link themselves with computer and to share information about the multinationals where we both represent our members,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. The UMW and the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> have ratified a new national wage agreement, but the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> is continuing negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a major producer that dropped out of the association. <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> has reached contract agreements with all the major oil companies. However, strikes are in progress at four refineries owned by <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>, which also owns <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. About one-third of the <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> membership is covered by new contracts, with negotations for the rest continuing at the district level, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> said.

 An appeals court has struck down a $ 1 million judgment won by a man who claimed that his sexual identity changed when his bicycle was struck by a soft-drink delivery truck. In a decision released Tuesday, the three-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> agreed unanimously that errors made in jury instructions by <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> required reversal of the award. The appeals court ruling came in a case involving <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, who was injured Sept. 18, 1978, in <PERSON> Inkster </PERSON> when his bike collided with a <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> truck. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, 16 at the time of the accident, charged negligence and said that after the accident `` he was a transsexual _ inclined to identify with the opposite sex,'' the court said. `` His theory ... was that prior to the accident he was predisposed to transsexualism and that the accident ` triggered' the condition,''' the appeals court said. The jury found <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> negligent and awarded <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> $ 1.07 million in damages. But <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> contested some jury instructions, including one saying <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> had a right to cross the street at the intersection. The company said he had that right only if the light was in his favor and he could do so safely. The appeals court agreed, saying that there was a dispute over who had the green light and that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' instruction implied that <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> had the green light. <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON>, attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, said the company `` feels the court decided the matter correctly.'' <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, said he was `` quite disappointed'' but added he had not seen a copy of the ruling. He said he did not know if he would appeal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 Leftist rebels fired machine guns at a bus traveling in defiance of their first transportation ban of 1988, killing three textile workers and wounding six, authorities reported. The insurgents, who have fought the U.S.-backed government for eight years, ordered the ban to protest legislative and municipal elections scheduled March 20. They say free and fair elections are impossible because of the civil war. Rebel broadcasts said the traffic ban began on Monday and would continue indefinitely. Police officials said the guerrillas attacked a bus belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as it traveled Monday night on the <LOCATION> Pan-American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The victims were identified as workers for the company, which is partly owned by the government. The guerrillas, grouped as the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, warned people to stay off the nation's roads and highways. They said in a broadcast on their clandestine Radio Venceremos that their troops had orders to attack vehicles violating the ban. Bus dispatchers contacted by telephone said the threat halted an estimated 90 percent of traffic between cities and reduced public transport by 80 percent within cities. The rebels called seven transport bans in 1987. In those, three people were killed, about 30 wounded and about 160 vehicles destroyed or damaged. In another development, four American religious workers were detained by the military for 21 hours in the war-crippled northern part of the country before being released Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, according to sources with the <ORGANIZATION> Mennonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It was the second time in less than a week that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lay workers had been picked up by the armed forces. Last Thursday, two Episcopalian women from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were detained briefly before being turned over to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials. In early January, the armed forces' Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a statement to some church officials asking that the number of foreign religious workers be restricted in war areas. According to Mennonite sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the volunteers were detained Monday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guayaba </LOCATION>, 15 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. They were released into the custody of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Vice Consul <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Schall </PERSON>. The volunteers were identified as <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Leaman-Miller </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, and his wife, <LOCATION> Korla </LOCATION>, 28, of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, no hometowns available; and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Landisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>.

 A strong earthquake shook <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and wide areas of the Philippine main island of <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> on Wednesday but there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volcanology </ORGANIZATION> and Seismology said the tremor, which occurred at 11:52 a.m. local time and lasted for nearly a minute, measured 5.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> said the quake registered 6.9 on its seismographs. The Richter scale measures ground movement as recorded on a seismograph. An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofable </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Philippine institute said seismologists calculated the epicenter of the earthquake to be off the coast of the island of <LOCATION> Cantanduanes </LOCATION>, 245 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. He said it was followed by several aftershocks. The earthquake shook tall buildings in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, but officials said they were not aware of any damage. The government-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the tremor was felt strongest in the cities of <LOCATION> Legazpi </LOCATION> and Naga, both in the <LOCATION> Bicol </LOCATION> region on southeastern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>, where people rushed out of homes and offices and into the streets. The news agency quoted officials in <LOCATION> Legazpi </LOCATION> as saying the earthquake was strong enough to cause cracks on concrete buildings but did not say if any buildings there were actually damaged. The earthquake also was recorded by the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tsunami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, but center officials said it was not strong enough to generate Pacific-wide tsunamis or tidal waves.

<HEAD>Mutual Fund Holders in Line for Special-Interest Tax Break</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Up to 20 million Americans are in line for some temporary tax relief when they file their returns this year _ and many apparently are totally unaware. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> considers the relief so important that he has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make it permanent, at a cost to the treasury of $ 400 million a year. The benefits are limited to owners of shares in publicly offered mutual funds that have at least 500 shareholders. The provision is one of those special-interest amendments that seem to find their way into every tax bill, especially when those bills are written behind closed doors. This one has its roots in the 1986 tax overhaul. As part of that big change, the itemized deduction for miscellaneous expenses was limited to those that exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. Thus, a taxpayer's deduction of union dues, subscriptions to job-related publications, work uniforms and the like would be restricted to the portion exceeding that income threshold. For example, if adjusted gross income was $ 30,000 and miscellaneous deductions totaled $ 2,000, only $ 1,400 could be deducted. In writing the 1986 tax law, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> at the last minute included a section, aimed at preventing tax evasion, that prohibits a `` pass-through entity'' _ such as a mutual fund _ from deducting an expense that an individual could not deduct. As a result, managers of mutual funds are dividing up their operating costs among shareholders, who are treated as if they had received those costs as income. They must list this income on their tax return. This `` phantom income,'' argued the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which represents managers and underwriters of mutual funds, `` can not be banked, can not be invested and can not be used to buy groceries. The only thing it is good for is to pay taxes on.'' But could not the recipient simply write off the `` phantom income'' as an investment expense? Sure _ if the recipient itemized deductions. Maybe. Unless a shareholder's total miscellaneous expenses exceeded 2 percent of his or her adjusted gross income, the mutual-fund writeoff would be lost. But the shareholder would still have to list the money as taxable income. In the closing days of the 1987 congressional session, tax-writers meeting behind closed doors agreed there was some inequity and gave shareholders relief for another year. That means mutual-fund expenses that are reported to a shareholder as income for 1987 may be deducted as a miscellaneous expense without regard to the 2-percent threshold. Other miscellaneous expenses will, of course, still be subject to the threshold. This relief became law in late December, but word is slow getting out. Money magazine, in asking 50 professional tax preparers to calculate the liability of a hypothetical family, found that 20 of the 50 were not aware of the change. <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> offices in several cities say they have never heard of the change. The only mention of the provision in <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> publications is a caution to taxpayers that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was considering some relief when the literature went to press. But the last chapter has yet to be written. In the 1989 budget that he sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked to make permanent the relief for mutual-fund holders _ an idea that already has wide support among congressional tax-writers.

<HEAD>Workers Dynamite Collapsed Building, Find Two More Bodies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Civil defense workers found two more bodies when they blew up what remained of a building that collapsed during flooding and mudslides that killed at least 80 people in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> toured some of the worst-hit areas on Tuesday as residents of the city of 5.6 million cleared away dirt and debris left by three days of torrential rains that began Friday. Civil defense workers on Tuesday combed through the wreckage of the three-story building in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teresa </LOCATION> district overlooking downtown Rio after using dynamite to explode what was left of the structure. Most of the building, which housed a medical clinic, collapsed under a mudslide, killing at least 11 elderly patients. A civil defense spokesman, <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>, said workers expected to find 10 to 15 more bodies in the rubble. He said rescue workers found two other bodies in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, flanked by Cabinet ministers and <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> state officials, flew aboard an air force helicopter to view the hillside shantytowns where cascading mud and rocks buried dozens of shacks. The president also visited the mountain resort city of <LOCATION> Petropolis </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, where floods and landslides earlier this month killed at least 167 people. According to civil defense figures, a total of 276 people have died in the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> area because of unusually heavy rains since Feb. 2. In the working-class neighborhood of <LOCATION> Abolicao </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s north side, firefighters and volunteers dug through the rubble of a three-story apartment building on Tuesday. Since it collapsed Sunday, 12 bodies and 14 survivors have been pulled from the debris. Residents said a teen-age girl remained missing. Government and private engineers said there was still a risk of new landslides in 27 mountain shantytowns. Donations and pledges of food, clothing, medicine, tents, beds and money poured in from other states and foreign countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. State health officials vaccinated <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> residents against tetanus and leptospirosis, a potentially deadly disease carried by rat droppings. <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> state hospitals reported 162 cases of leptospirosis and at least six deaths from the disease.

 After four months without a news conference, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> faces questions tonight on hostage-taking in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s crackdown in the occupied territories, and the bitter fight by Republicans wanting to succeed him. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also may be asked about his embattled attorney general, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the target of an investigation by an independent counsel, and the separate felony convictions of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides and presidential confidants <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>. Also still awaited is <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reaction to a plan by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats for $ 25 million in `` humanitarian'' aid for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contras, a package that was put together after rejection of the president's proposal to give the rebels new weapons On the political front, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has doggedly steered clear of involvement in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential race. However, he may be tempted to comment on the increasingly sharp words between Republicans, given that he is the author of the so-called 11th commandment forbidding Republicans to speak ill of each other. The 8 p.m. EST session in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION> will be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first news conference since last Oct. 22, which was dominated by questions about the 508-point collapse of the stock market. A lot has happened since then, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has had little to say except in prepared speeches. He has been largely isolated from the press, commenting only occasionally in response to a shouted question as he boards a helicopter or to a query during a picture-taking ceremony in the Oval Office. Tonight's session comes amid intense diplomatic activity by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who arrived back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday evening, was reporting to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today on his talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> about arms control, the timing of a superpower summit and the likelihood of a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. All of those issues pose possible questions for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. With barely a day back in the capital, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> leaves again tonight, this time to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> where he will meet with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders about efforts to revive peace negotiations. White House officials say there is an urgency to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' efforts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> because of the violence in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says 63 Palestinians have been killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> gunfire since violence began Dec. 8. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Tuesday he has encountered `` intense skepticism'' about the chances of a breakthrough on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> negotiations, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` a few ideas'' that could help end the deadlock. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> likely will be asked about the kidnapping in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and the eight other Americans seized there. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, onetime aide to former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, was serving with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces when he was taken in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last Wednesday. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> raised some questions by saying he wanted `` to rescue'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, but aides later clarified that he was referring to diplomatic efforts, not a military maneuver. A group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> claims to have abducted <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. The group is demanding <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from the `` security zone'' it maintains in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, release of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Lebanese prisoners held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and suspension of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic activity in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.

 Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> wore a blue baseball cap to hide his scar as he left <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> 12 days after undergoing brain surgery that will have to be repeated in a few months. Doctors said they were `` delighted'' with <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s recovery from surgery Feb. 12 to repair an aneurysm in an artery supplying blood to the senator's brain. But a hospital statement said that a second aneurysm has been found and will have to be corrected later. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, 45, left the hospital Tuesday by car with his wife, <PERSON> Jill </PERSON>, and his brother, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A family spokesman, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasky </PERSON>, said the Democrat from <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> was under orders to rest at home and was to have no visitors nor be given office work. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Rasky </PERSON>, is `` in great shape and great spirits. He's full of vigor I think if the doctors had n't told him to rest, he could have gone to the office.'' <PERSON> Rasky </PERSON> said the family purposely avoided announcing the senator's plan to leave the hospital in order to avoid the stress of any media interest But <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> and his wife paused briefly beside their car to pose for a photographer. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s blue cap covered the scar on his left temple where the surgical incision was made. He smiled broadly as the camera shutter clicked. The hospital statement said neurosurgeons earlier had found the additional aneurysm on the opposite side of the brain from the aneurysm that was repaired. `` The second aneurysm is smaller and could not be approached during the earlier surgery,'' the statement said. `` There were no signs of leakage, but the second aneurysm will require surgical repair.'' No date has been set for the new operation, the statement said. It added: `` Procedures of this type are usually done after the patient has fully recovered from any earlier surgery, usually within two to three months.'' <PERSON> Rasky </PERSON> said doctors told <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> the second surgery could come in less than three months, if his recovery went well, and that recovery from the new operation would take less time. But the spokesman said the senator will not return to his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office until he has recovered from the second surgery. A doctor associated with the case, who asked not to be identified, said that about 15 percent of all patients with one cerebral aneurysm will develop another. If the aneurysm is small, stable and not bleeding, he said, it can be left and repaired later. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s release just 12 days after surgery, said the doctor, shows `` he is doing very well.'' An aneurysm is a weakened area in an artery. The pressure of blood flow causes the area to balloon, forming a blister-like flaw on the artery side. Aneurysms are dangerous because they can rupture suddenly and hemorrhage, or they can leak. Such bleeding from a cerebral aneurysm can quickly cause brain damage or death. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> was admitted to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> on Feb. 12 after a middle-of-the-night, emergency transfer from a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> hospital. He had been taken to the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> hospital the day before after experiencing severe neck pain and nausea. An X-ray test located the aneursym within his skull and he underwent surgery within hours. The doctor associated with the case said then that about one-third of all patients with cerebral aneurysms die. Typically, the doctor said, surgery for a brain aneurysm requires an incision in the temple area. Surgeons then cut a small window in the skull to enable them to lift the brain slightly and locate the flawed artery. The aneurysm is corrected by permanently attaching a clip, a small metal device with locking jaws, at the base of the blister-like flaw and parallel to the blood flow. Eventually, the artery will heal itself. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> had been treated for a neck pain that started two weeks before his surgery. A doctor diagnosed the ailment as a pinched nerve and possibly a viral infection of neck muscles. The senator wore a neck brace as treatment. When the pain left after several days, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> abandoned the brace and went on a speaking tour. But the pain, along with nausea, recurred. The senator was admitted to a hospital near his <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, home and then transferred by ambulance to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. A doctor said an aneurysm leaking into the brain cavity can cause neck pain.

<HEAD>Investigators Say Quid Pro Quo Latin For `Planned Payoff'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The `` quid pro quo'' in a memo to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> may be a planned payoff to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, say government sources familiar with a criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. The Sept. 25, 1985, memo from longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> discusses an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commitment not to bomb a proposed $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline. `` We all recognize that there would be no progress to this point'' had Israeli-born Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> `` not been able to obtain the security package which involves the never-to-be-stated but fully understood quid pro quo which helped to produce that commitment,'' said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s memo. The memo does n't elaborate <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s attorneys say the `` quid pro quo'' is a reference to an agreement that <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a partner in the proposed pipeline, would make available to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> substantial amounts of oil generated from the project. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>'s lawyer. However, investigators for independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> question the explanation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers and are seeking to determine whether the language may be a reference to planned payments to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the government sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> the `` quid pro quo'' memo, along with a handwritten letter from then-Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> in which <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he `` would go a long way to help'' the pipeline. One of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, said the attorney general does n't recall any discussion of the memo with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who hand-delivered the documents to the attorney general. <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> did not read the memo closely. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s memo urged <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to enlist support for the pipeline project from top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, hinting that he might talk to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> about it and then proposing a discussion with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers say he took none of the initiatives suggested by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, but only referred <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to the office of then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. A separate Wallach-to-Meese memo also dated Sept. 25, 1985, spells out <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>'s close ties to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, saying the businessman described an arrangement in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will receive up to $ 700 million over 10 years from the pipeline. `` What was also indicated to me, and which would be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly to Labor,'' says the second memo, the focal point of <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s criminal investigation. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> says he does n't recall reading the portion of the document relating to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> payments. The independent counsel is investigating whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> knew of a possibly improper payment plan involving the Israeli political party and, if so, why he did not do something about it. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it illegal for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, companies or their agents to offer foreign officials anything of value to influence them to provide help in business matters. The law states that the attorney general may file a civil suit if it appears the person or company is about to engage in an act that would violate the law. Both memos were publicly released Monday, along with an exchange of notes between <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, on Tuesday defended his communications with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, saying: `` We all agree that we favor the laying of the pipeline. So why would anyone need to use bribes? Nobody said he -LRB- <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> -RRB- gave the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> anything or proposed anything to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' However, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> acknowledged Tuesday through a spokesman in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that the Israeli government had been offered a discount on oil purchases amounting to $ 65 million to $ 70 million a year in return for approving the pipeline, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. But the aide said that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> did not take the offer seriously and failed to pass it on to colleagues, the newspaper said. In another development, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>, the chief counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee that investigated the Iran-Contra affair, says the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should have turned over <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s memos when the committee subpoenaed material. One of the memos refers to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> help in efforts to free American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and quotes <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> as saying, `` There is a feeling the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ` owes' and that the accomplishment of this -LRB- pipeline -RRB- project ... is appropriate.'' `` I would like to have questioned <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> about this,'' <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> was quoted as saying in today's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said today it would be unwise to threaten to pull <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops out of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to counter pressures inside <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for the removal of all nuclear weapons from German `` The appearance of the use of threats by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does the Germans a disservice,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said in testimony prepared for delivery before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee. `` Threatening <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with a diminished American commitment if <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> does not undertake certain specific actions would be counterproductive,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader said. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> delegation he led to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> earlier this month concluded that `` no responsible German official contemplates denuclearizing <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' Some West Germans do advocate eliminating all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear systems in the aftermath of the successful negotiation of the U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons from the continent. But <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said most West German leaders reject that as a step leading to domination by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s superior weight in non-nuclear arms such as tanks, artillery and aircraft. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the top priority for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> now must be the forging of a detailed and comprehensive proposal on conventional arms reduction to present to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year. On Tuesday, former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vision of a world free of nuclear weapons is neither obtainable nor desirable. `` I do not believe this is possible and I do not believe our leaders should create the impression that it is possible, let alone desirable,'' he said. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said he was concerned about the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> being exposed to Soviet superiority in conventional weapons should nuclear weapons be abolished. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> told the committee he believes the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should ratify the new treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, if only to avoid a bruising and divisive political upheaval inside the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. But <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said he believes the treaty is `` flawed and leaves us in a weaker position, both politically and militarily.'' He said he was especially troubled by the treaty's reduction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles to zero on each side because of the expectations that may create in the negotiation of a treaty reducing long-range strategic nuclear arms. `` It implies that zero in all categories is obtainable, and it is not obtainable,'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said. He said the treaty should be ratified, if for no other reason, because keeping a force of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> and ground-launched cruise missiles in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is now politically impossible. The treaty is the result of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 1979 `` dual-track'' decision to deploy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to counter Soviet SS-20 medium-range missiles while at the same time negotiating their removal. It calls for the destruction of all missiles with a range from 300 miles to 3,400 miles. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said he believes the treaty is flawed because it will not reduce in any significant way the ability of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to devastate <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with other nuclear weapons and because it substantially reduces the ability of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to retaliate with nuclear weapons based in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Nuclear deterrence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will now rely primarily on weapons based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said that creates `` a psychological and political imbalance,'' especially when weighed against Soviet superiority in conventional forces.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher Against Yen; Stocks Continue Climb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar closed slightly higher against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today after a sharp decline the previous day, while share prices gained for the 10th consecutive day. The dollar closed at 128.75, up 0.25 yen from its closing figure of 128.50 yen Tuesday, when it lost 1.45 yen. It had opened at 128.90 yen today but never went higher, changing hands between 128.57 and 128.90 yen. The dollar came under selling pressure after a statement by <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank, who told reporters today that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's sharp decline has hit bottom, but that unstable factors remained, such as large external imbalances among major economic countries. The dollar rebounded somewhat as life insurance and securities firms went on buying the currency just before the end of trading, <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the Nikkei average of 225 selected shares, a 102.74-point winner Tuesday, took on an additional 19.20 points, or 0.07 percent, to close today's session at 24,968.65 points. `` The small gain shows investors are becoming careful,'' said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Sanyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But he noted that the volume of trading was a hefty 1.1 billion shares, the heaviest this year, and said: `` If the volume stays at the current level, the stock average will easily top the 27,000-point level.'' Large-size issues, such as shipbuildings and steels, were bought, and chemicals, papers, brokerages and real estate issues were firm.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to bar federal agencies from releasing information that he says could harm the economic competitiveness of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the new field of superconductivity. The proposed change in the Freedom of Information Act was one of three proposals <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday in a message in which he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sometimes falls short in making commercial use of laboratory breakthroughs. The other proposals would broaden the present protection for patents on manufacturing processes and require courts to consider the effects of joint commercial ventures on international competitiveness before deciding they violate antitrust laws. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was proposing the information law change because `` commercially valuable scientific and technological information generated in federal facilities loses potential commercial value when it is released wholesale'' under the act. `` Mandatory disclosure of such information under <ORGANIZATION> FOIA </ORGANIZATION> could encourage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitors to exploit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> science and technology base rather than making investments in their own research and development infrastucture,'' the president said. Under his proposal, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` federal agencies will be required to withhold information of this nature requested under the Freedom of Information Act where disclosure could reasonably be expected to harm the economic competitiveness of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his proposal would apply to `` federal government-generated, government-owned scientific and technical information.'' In addition, he said, the administration is developing `` a uniform policy to permit federal contractors to own the rights to technical information that they develop for the government.'' Although the three legislative proposals were lumped together under the title `` Superconductivity Competitiveness Act of 1988,'' the president's message did not indicate that their application would be limited to the field of superconductivity. The federal government spent about $ 55 million on superconductivity research in fiscal year 1987 and will spend more than $ 100 million in the current fiscal year, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` There is no time to waste in this effort,'' he said. `` There is a growing realization that, although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has long been a leader in breakthroughs in the laboratory, it has occasionally failed to convert these breakthroughs into commercial applications.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed amending patent laws to give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies the right to sue and collect monetary damages in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts when someone else uses their processes abroad to manufacture products that are then shipped to, and sold in, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They can already file such suits to prevent the use of their processes by domestic manufacturers, but must sue foreign manufacturers in foreign courts in order to collect damages. The White House said the proposed change `` is consistent with the treatment of process patents in many foreign countries.''

 The 1988 presidential campaign is making a quick side trip to the nation's northeast corner this week for lobster, maple syrup and votes, with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nervously hoping for neighborly victories in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. With their strong regional ties, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> need to win their parties' caucuses in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> this weekend and the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> primaries Tuesday to build momentum for Super Tuesday. But former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> would like to embarrass <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his home territory _ especially in the wake of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s weak showings in Tuesday's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> caucuses. In both <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, strong <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> organizations will carry the burden, for all the candidates will be spending most of the next seven days campaigning in the South, focus of the Super Tuesday's primaries on March 8. The Republican vice president will touch down for airport news conferences today in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Me., and <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION> _ his last scheduled visits for the week <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> may be back in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> by the weekend. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and is widely expected to be the winner in the town caucuses in the state scattered over the weekend. But his campaign is worried about <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. With a usual turnout of only about 5,000 Republicans, the caucuses are a good opportunity for success using <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s tactics from other states _ flooding caucuses with new participants and winning surprising victories The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, which has a strong organization on the ground as it did in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, faces less opposition among Democrats, who have mostly left the states to the governor from neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> `` It does n't appear that the other campaigns are taking these states seriously,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>. The one possible exception to the rest of the Democratic field's bypassing of the states is <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> The Rainbow Coalition _ formed during <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential bid _ actually has remained active in the state and <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>'s Socialist mayor, <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, has endorsed him `` The <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> has been working hard,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chief Violet Coffin. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in contrast has had 12-15 paid staffers working the state, she said. Neither of the states' events has drawn a great deal of candidate's attention for several reason. First, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> together will send 41 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> and 39 delegates to the Republican meeting this summer. The Super Tuesday events decide which candidates have the allegiance of 1,307 Democratic delegates and 712 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates. Only the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> caucuses actually begin the delegate selection processes; the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> primary on Tuesday is simply a beauty contest expression of preference. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s delegates will be picked in the late spring in a separate caucus process. But the close ties that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has with <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> make it an excellent chance for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to stun the front-runner in his home turf. `` It will be a battle,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Northeastern coordinator. `` <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has had a lot of people on the ground in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. ... But my concern is the Rev. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>.'' It is the potential of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s `` invisible army'' of supporters to take over the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses that worries the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staff. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> GOP state chairwoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stram </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> sees the caucuses this way: `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has the broadest organization. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has organized a lot of new voters. ... The <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> people have an organization that has been working here.'' On the Democratic side in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, state party chief <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> acknowledges that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a home-field advantage, but he says another candidate could have an impact. `` The question is whether anybody is making an effort here'' besides <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> said. And he pointed out that there is a seventh candidate contending in the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> caucuses _ uncommitted. Led by <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, party activists have been pushing for uncommitted delegates to be elected at the city and town meetings. In <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has the potential for a good showing, although the vice president is credited with a broader organization. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has the backing of several <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders, including former Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snelling </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> party chief <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ from the farm state of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> _ has also won points with the state's dairy farmers by supporting changes in the milk price support program that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not endorsed. In <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, which votes on Super Tuesday, the governor enjoys a prohibitive lead among Democratic presidential candidates, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leads the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> field, a new poll indicates. The survey, commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> WCVB-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WEEI </ORGANIZATION> radio and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, was conducted by the Gallup organization among <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> voters last weekend. It said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led with 61 percent support, with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> trailing with 13 percent. The other Democrats finished in single digits. In the Republican race, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> native _ led with 49 percent, compared to 29 percent saying they support <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Those others were in single digits, with 8 percent undecided. The telephone survey of presidential preference involved 639 registered Democrats with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent. The poll also reached 331 Republicans, with a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percent.

<TEXT>
 A dinosaur egg discovered in a central <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> quarry may contain the oldest embryo ever found and change perceptions about how some of the creatures became extinct, a scientist says. A scan of a partially collapsed egg the size of a human fist has revealed a 2-centimeter-long gray area that appears to be the crude outline of an embryo, said <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> paleontologist. In the scan, the egg shell appears white. Most of the egg's interior is dark gray except for a tiny area that has the shape of a head and other features, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said The egg was discovered last September in the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lloyd </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quarry </LOCATION> where scientists have uncovered thousands of allosaurus bones, a meat-eater that stood up to 20 feet high. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said skeletal remains of the dinosaurs that lived during the Jurassic Period, which began around 210 million B.C. and ended 145 million B.C., have ranged from 100-pound juveniles to 3-ton adults. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, professor emeritus at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> and one of the scientists who excavated most of the bones, said dinosaur eggs usually can not be associated with a particular species, but because this egg was found among a great deposit of allosaurus bones, it likely was from an allosaurus. It is among the oldest eggs or egg fragments ever discovered, and if it in fact contains an embryo, would be the oldest dinosaur embryo found, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the egg could lead to a new theory of how dinosaurs in the area became extinct. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said geologists previously believed the dinosaurs in the quarry were trapped in a bog. `` A dinosaur is not going to lay an egg in a bog while it's sinking,'' he said But <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> disputed that. `` The egg has to be formed within a body, and while it is in a body that body may sink,'' he said Tuesday night. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said the fact that other eggs and egg fragments were not found in the quarry indicates this egg was not in a nest. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the egg will be taken to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> where <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will take three-dimensional X-rays of it.

<TEXT>
 Some elections are more equal than others, fortunately for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He was trounced twice in Republican presidential contests, but he'd left the scene of the landslides. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who won a runaway in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and a comfortable victory in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, said he had gained major headway as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race moved toward the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. `` It pays to come to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>,'' he said Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. But the pay was n't very high. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> apparently swept the delegates at stake in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> _ all 18 of them. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was second, just below the 20 percent it took to share in the delegation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lagged narrowly behind him. But compare that delegate payoff to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Republicans there will choose 111 nominating delegates on March 8, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ranks as the favorite. His role and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s are reversed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ the vice president leads and the senator from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> has virtually written off the state. In Democratic competition Tuesday, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> captured <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and nobody got any nominating delegates. The results were purely advisory; the real prizes come later. Those results, especially the defeats <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> absorbed by running third in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and fourth in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, were muted for lack of the attention concentrated on the leadoff presidential contests in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, in contests played to national television audiences, with anchormen on location. The states were comparable, the stakes were comparable, but Tuesday's contests were not magnified by being first. So <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, absorbed the twin defeats without a word of comment. It's time for targeting, and the next one on his list comes this weekend in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he maintains a home and where he expects to win in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses. That's also a <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> target, and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp says the former television evangelist could pose a significant challenge in caucuses, the kind of competition that best fits his organization. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should pay in the national public opinion polls for the defeats on Tuesday. `` I do n't see how he's going to continue to ride so high,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` The vice president is definitely wounded.'' But it is nothing <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and the just-for-show <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> primary on March 1, ca n't heal. Those contests, and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> primary on March 5, with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> formidable and claiming he can win, all preface Super Tuesday, March 8. That's a 20-state primary and caucus day, with 1,307 Democratic delegates and 712 Republicans at stake. That competition is concentrated in the South, but it includes a half-dozen contests in other regions, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. With candidates picking their spots and with delegates to be won through proportional representation among the Democrats, Super Tuesday is n't likely to be any more conclusive than what has gone before. Republican rules make it more likely that one candidate can pile up a significant delegate lead on March 8. Ironically, for all the efforts at calendar rigging and early-season decisions, the pivotal primaries may still be weeks away, in populous industrial states like <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and, finally, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Sugar Payments and Lamb Quotas Would Get Ax Under House Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers are hoping to melt some of the ice around their sweeping trade bill with proposals to drop Senate-sponsored curbs on lamb imports and $ 400 million in payments to sugar refiners. `` I think there is a need for trade legislation,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., said Tuesday after the plan was sent to senators on a conference committee drafting the trade bill `` If we do n't get it this year it could very well mean that we wo n't get it for some time in the future.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, promised early consideration of the offer proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members who are also part of the conference committee. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said there could be a reply as early as the weekend from <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members on the conference committee. The so-called `` subconference'' of Ways and Means and Finance members is one of 17 such bodies that have been formed to draw up portions of the 1,000-page bill. The lamb provision would limit imports of fresh chilled or frozen lamb meat. It was attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the trade bill at the urging of Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont. The sugar provision would let some refining companies that claim tney are being hurt by high tariffs recover some $ 400 million in duties they paid a number of years ago on imported sugar that was refined and re-exported. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was fiercely opposed to it, saying insufficient documents existed to administer the plan properly. At a news conference, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> again expressed hope the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would pass an overall compromise `` before the Easter recess'' but said that might not be possible. One issue remaining is Democratic presidential aspirant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s amendment to require 10 percent annual rollbacks in Japanese trade surpluses with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The measure, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, does not appear in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version and it seems likely to be changed in the final product. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has been basing part of his campaign on his trade proposal and other Democrats on the panel have been reluctant to do anything that might be interpreted as undercutting him. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> indicated that no reshaping of provisions dealing with unfair foreign trade barriers is likely before the `` Super Tuesday'' primaries in the South on March 8. The chairman was an opponent of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s plan when it was debated in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last year. He indicated, however, that he would present the case for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s plan. `` I've been commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> to do as much as I can to keep as much of it in as I can, and I'm going to do that,'' he said. After a report on Monday that lawmakers would `` dump'' the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> provision following the Super Tuesday voting, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> issued a statement saying that `` Mr. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s amendment has not been scuttled or jettisoned.''

<HEAD>Dole's Support Broad in South Dakota, Except for Strong
Conservatives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republicans across the ideological spectrum helped <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> win the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary, with the exception of strong conservatives, whose support could prove important in later contests, exit polls said. Those Republicans, one fifth of the total, favored <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, helping the former television minister challenge Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for second place in the state primary Tuesday, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> exit poll found. Among Democrats, many voters chose a candidate in the final days of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> campaign, and they went strongly for Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who employed aggressive television advertising in his winning effort, polls said. A third of the Democratic voters told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> they made up their minds in the last three days of the race, and 45 percent of them backed <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, to 23 percent for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who finished second. The television networks based their analyses of the voting on random surveys of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> as they left polling places. The networks did not conduct surveys in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, which held party caucuses Tuesday. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, campaigned determinedly in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, sensing his disadvantage, steered clear of the state. The polls said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> prevailed in nearly all categories; ABC News, for example, said he won more than seven in 10 liberals and moderates and four in 10 conservatives. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> separated out another category, `` very conservative'' voters, and said 42 percent went for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to 32 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and 17 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> did poorly among very conservative voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won last week's primary, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> noted that more such voters may turn out in the Super Tuesday southern state primaries March 8 When considering <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s overall strong showing, `` The caveat is that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't contest it,'' and that Republican turnout was light, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst. Still, he said, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lost almost every group he won in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' including Republicans who support President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and those who are concerned about foreign policy. One important outcome was `` a narrowing of the margins,'' <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said: Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a liberal Democrat, fared poorly, as did Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a conservative Republican. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> got just 8 percent of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vote, to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s 27 percent. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also won more than half the evangelical or fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION>, about a fifth of all <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said. Among the Democrats, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> split the liberal vote, but <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won moderate and conservative Democrats, won the male vote while splitting the female vote with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and won among the less wealthy and the less educated, again splitting the others with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> `` went upscale'' by doing better among the better-educated and wealthier Democrats than he had in the past, <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. `` The good news for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is that he did well in a downscale state,'' he added. Surprisingly, the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll found that a plurality of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Democrats, 46 percent, said they believed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> eventually will win the presidential nomination, though not all voted for him. Even 28 percent of those who voted for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said they expected <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to be the nominee. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> reported that 40 percent of the Democrats chose farm policy as a key issue, more than the number that selected any other subject. `` <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was definitely strong among people who cared about farm policy,'' with 55 percent support to 18 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> surveys manager <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. Among the losing Democrats, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> found that former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> was viewed unfavorably by twice as many <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> as viewed him favorably, and 55 percent were not pleased that <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> re-entered the race after withdrawing last summer amid questions about his marital fidelity. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s poll had a margin of sampling error of 3 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll's margin of error was 4 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s was 5 percent.

 The 4,000 nuclear weapons that would remain in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after elimination of intermediate-range nuclear weapons should stay there until its conventional forces are better balanced with the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a European television audience. `` Ensuring the peace requires that these nuclear weapons stay where they are until we can achieve a better balance of conventional forces on the continent,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Because of them and the Soviet knowledge that we have them, we can maintain the balance that maintains the peace.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke in a televised address broadcast by satellite to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by the `` Worldnet'' facilities of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.

Nevertheless, he said, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must continue to have battlefield nuclear weapons, those with a range of under 300 miles. `` The alliance's adversaries must not believe that our only possible response to a limited attack is to begin an intercontinental nuclear exchange,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` If they do, they may doubt that we would risk such a response and be tempted to test us.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has expressed opposition to upgrading short-range missiles until <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> develops an overall arms control strategy and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reduces it conventional force strength. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must insure that it maintains `` all the modern forces, both conventional and nuclear,'' to uphold a strategy of flexible response to Soviet aggression. `` After all, our goal is not a nuclear-free or a tank-free or an army-free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but a war-free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> scored a solid victory in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s Republican presidential primary Tuesday, far outpacing Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had written off the state. And Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> came out on top on the Democratic side after a campaign blitz. `` I took <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> very seriously,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Let the message go out, that it pays to come to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had sidestepped the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> contests and headed directly South after his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary victory. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s win over <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered no nominating delegates, but gave <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> a victory to point to as the candidates campaign in the Super Tuesday states. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, however, scored a win of his own Tuesday night, in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s caucuses <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the resounding victor in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary a week ago; <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses eight days before that. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary was moved from its traditional June date to the front of the nominating calendar this year. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> campaigned heavily here. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also vied for support. Republican voters were choosing all 18 delegates the state will send to their national convention next summer, while 15 of the 19 Democratic delegates were to be allocated on the basis of the primary. The Democratic primary is legally non-binding because it falls prior to the date allowed by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rules. But state party officials have said they expect the March 12 statewide caucus to apportion those 15 delegates according to the results of Tuesday's primary. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Legislature moved the presidential primary from June to February in an attempt to draw candidates to a state that was largely ignored by presidential contenders in past elections. Backers of the move said it would force the candidates to pay attention to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and the problems of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had 44 percent; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 31 percent; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, 8 percent; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 6 percent; <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 5 percent. For the Republicans, with 99 percent of precincts reporting, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had 55 percent; <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 20 percent; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 19 percent and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> 5 percent.

<HEAD>Students Vote To Keep Nuke Cloud As School Symbol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some teachers are blasting a decision by <ORGANIZATION> Richland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students to retain a nuclear mushroom cloud as their symbol, but supporters said the emblem did not signify atomic destruction. Students in this `` atomic city'' voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to formally adopt the mushroom cloud as the symbol of the Bombers. `` It stands for nuclear holocaust and the end of the world,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Deatherage </PERSON>, a teacher who has long opposed the symbol. `` It's an inappropriate symbol for high school kids to be glorifying.'' <PERSON> Deatherage </PERSON> said students should not have made the decision since they were easily swayed by emotions and did not understand the objections of outsiders. `` They were tied to the symbol because of school pride,'' he said. `` The whole process was a farce.'' <PERSON> Deatherage </PERSON> and teacher <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigre </PERSON> said opponents had only a few chances to communicate with students or other teachers. `` It never came up at a faculty meeting,'' <PERSON> Wigre </PERSON> said, because the administration did not want to divide the staff. But most students and administrators expressed satisfaction with the process. `` Clearly that's what the kids wanted,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, 18. `` I'm very pleased.'' `` Students have a very simple view of it,'' said activities director <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, who helped organize the election. `` To them it was a symbol of <ORGANIZATION> Richland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` No more and no less.'' The issue is an emotional one in this city of 30,000 adjacent to the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation, where for more than 40 years the federal government has made plutonium for nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Richland </PERSON> was a sleepy village of a few hundred residents when <PERSON> Hanford </PERSON> was carved out of the central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> desert as part of the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project to produce atomic bombs in World War II. Many of parents of the school's 1,300 students are employed at the site _ where the government announced last week that plutonium production is being phased out at the cost of 2,600 jobs during the next two years. The symbol, which is the letter `` R'' with a mushroom cloud rising above it, has been used for some 17 years, but was never formally adopted by the student body. Over the years there have been attempts to eliminate it, and some student leaders decided it was time to formally adopt a symbol. During a morning class Tuesday, students were given white ballots with four symbols portrayed in black.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> racked up a win outside his home turf of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Democratic presidential caucuses, while Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> beat out <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ as did former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. With 80 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> precincts reporting _ the last official tally provided early today _ <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had 43 percent; <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, 28 percent; <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, 15 percent; and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 11 percent. The uncommitteds were 3 percent. And with 74 percent of the Democratic precincts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, scored 34 percent; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 20 percent, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 18 percent and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, 8 percent. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> each had 1 percent, and 19 percent were uncommitted. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary Tuesday night, setting the scene for more battles for the front-running spot as he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> head into a new round of contests. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won last week's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, while <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was the victor in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses on Feb. 8. Both <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have been campaigning heavily in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who bypassed <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, is vowing to come on strong in his native region. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, virtually ignored <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican front-runner nationwide, made no effort in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, where he was campaigning, he went to bed Tuesday night without commenting to reporters on the returns. For the first time in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, an attempt was being made to report results of the caucuses on the night they occurred _ meaning the preferences of all those who attended <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> caucuses based on a straw poll and the preferences of delegates elected at the Democratic caucuses. The caucuses began the process of selecting 78 of the state's 87-member delegation to the Democratic National Convention and the 31 delegates to the Republican National Convention Moving the caucus date from March to February resulted in a lengthy dispute between the state and national Democratic parties because the new date is earlier than national party rules allow. The state party agreed that a presidential preference poll taken at the Democratic caucuses would be kept secret until 5 p.m. March 8 and that the state party would not cooperate in reporting of caucus-night results.

 Share prices opened fractionally higher on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock exchange today but then fell slightly in early trading. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index was down 1.6 points at 1,756.3 at 9:45 a.m. When the market officially opened at 9 a.m., the index was up 0.9 points at 1,758.8. Dealers said share prices had moved ahead strongly on bullish sentiment about the British economy, but the market did n't find a direction and major shares were narrowly mixed. The largest fall among the index of 100 shares was <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goldfields </ORGANIZATION>, which dropped 12 pence to 818 pence because of weakness in the gold price. Banks showed some of the largest gains, with <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> up 6 at 480 and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> up 8 at 558. Barclays increase was due to release its 1987 earnings later today following National Westminster which released its results on Tuesday. The early trend followed a small drop Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 1.17 to 2,039.12, and a small gain in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> overnight, where the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index rose 19.20 to 24,968.65.

<HEAD>Wife To Appeal Ruling Against Her Smoking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The attorney for a chain-smoking woman under court order not to smoke in her family's presence says he will appeal the decision as `` outrageously unconstitutional.'' The order barring <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON>, 41, from smoking in front of her husband and their three children was issued Tuesday by Justice <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> of the trial-level state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> also was directed to confine her cigarette puffing to a small television room in the couple's Kings Point mansion. `` This is clearly a violation of her First Amendment rights,'' said her attorney, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandes </PERSON>. `` Who is going to enforce this? ... Are the children going to become policemen and turn their mother in for smoking?'' The ruling is `` outrageously unconstitutional,'' he added. Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Jahanshah </PERSON>, 42, a non-smoking surgeon, went to court in an attempt to get his wife to stop lighting up in front of him and their children, ages 6, 7 and 9. He claimed he tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to get his wife to curtail her two-pack-a-day habit. He described her smoking as `` offensive and detrimental to the health of the children.'' The Roofehs, who were married in 1976, have been feuding since May when Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> filed for divorce, which is pending before Diamond. The Roofehs are still living together. Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON>, who called her Iranian-born husband `` an ayatollah,'' said she smokes `` just to annoy'' him. `` I'll quit when I get him out of the house,'' she said. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shayne </PERSON>, the dean of the Academy of Law for the <ORGANIZATION> Nassau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes the order was legal because it's not Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON>'s rights but the rights of her family that were violated by her smoking. `` I think it's been established that smoking is certainly hazardous to a person's health, especially to a young child,'' said <PERSON> Shayne </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> said she has been limiting her smoking to the one small room in the couple's six-bedroom home in recent months. `` It's nothing new,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> in referring to the constraints the judge has placed on her. `` I've always tried not to smoke in front of the children.'' <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> said when they were married his wife promised him she would not smoke in front of him. She admits that she broke her promise in 1984 but it was because of stress from a stroke she suffered. She also has admitted that she used to sneak outside when she got an uncontrollable nicotine craving before 1984. In issuing his ruling, the judge denied a request by <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> for an order of protection against his wife. <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON> had argued that smoking cigarettes may be as `` detrimental and reprehensible'' as would be `` hitting, slapping, punching, or spitting.'' The court found, however, that an order of protection is a tool designed to protect family members from domestic violence and not to protect against a spouse that smokes. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlissel </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Roofeh </PERSON>, commended the judge on the decision. `` It is a natural extension of the law that if a child is being harmed by a parent's conduct it should step in and safeguard the child,'' said <PERSON> Schlissel </PERSON>.

 As the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election campaign picks up pace, it is coming more and more under scrutiny in other nations. Here is what some newspapers and commentators said recently about the election process in general and about Super Tuesday in particular.

<TEXT>
 _ Sueddeutsche Zeitung of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> -LRB- liberal -RRB-: `` In a nation like the Federal Republic -LRB- of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-, where the parties have extended their power into every corner of society, the drama par excellence now occurring on the American stage would be unimaginable. `` Not the party, but the primary determines who will enter the ` final match' on Nov. 8. And the primary is close to the ideal democracy imagined by <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousseau </PERSON>. `` The contenders must meet the voters face to face _ from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, in living rooms, schools and shopping centers. And a candidate can climb into the ring with or without the blessing of his party. `` Surprises are guaranteed.''

<HEAD>`Political Olympics'</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ The <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Times of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> -LRB- English-language, independent -RRB-: `` The strong belief remains that none of the Democratic candidates will emerge as an unbeatable front-runner after Super Tuesday or later In this case, brokering will choose the candidate at the convention, and waiting on the sidelines for just such a development is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. `` What may be understandable but nevertheless regrettable is that campaigning so far resembles a ` political Olympics' with a concentration on percentage points in pre-ballotting polls and in the results. This tends to obscure the issues, particularly in the reporting by the media.''

<HEAD>Roughhouse Election</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurrssen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> correspondent, The Sunday Star of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> -LRB- English-language, independent: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is in for a roughhouse 1988 election season. `` It is going to be quite a spectacle. ... And the campaigning shows every indication of deteriorating into a bare-knuckle brawl, especially among the Republicans where the two leading candidates... have already started slugging away at each other. `` None of the other candidates is likely to shake the Bush-Dole lead, though there could be a rude surprise for both of the leaders in some parts of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> where former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has enthusiastic supporters. ... This could make Mr. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> _ who has sympathy for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> government _ a significant factor at the party convention if there has to be horsetrading of delegates to find a presidential nominee.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<HEAD>`Silly Season' is Past</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ The Independent of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -LRB- independent -RRB-: `` It looked on occasion last year as if <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s ... method of selecting presidential candidates was finally coming to pieces. There was speculation that nobody of any ability or self-respect would subject himself and his family to the intense strain and scrutinizing involved in the race for nomination. `` Such questions no longer dominate the political agenda; suggestions that the system is unable to throw up a credible slate are rarely heard. The political silly season is, mercifully, past. ... `` The main problem for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has turned out not to be the caliber of the leading candidates. It is, increasingly, the quality of government in the final months of a lame-duck administration.

<HEAD>`Disappointing Comment'</HEAD>

 _ The <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- independent -RRB-: `` Questioned on his defeat by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -LRB- in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> -RRB-, Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s first response was to rebut the ` lies' put about by Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he wanted to raise taxes. Evidently the last thing Mr. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> wanted to be associated with was a responsible fiscal policy which he believed had cost him a significant number of votes at a crucial stage in the presidential race. `` For the rest of the world this is a disappointing comment on the nature of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politics. But it hardly comes as a surprise. The shadow of the presidential election has for months hung over the struggle to rein back <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s budget deficit. Its influence can only increase as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term draws to a close.''

A. `` If you speak from the heart and say that someone should have lost, you're seen as a dirty player. It's a matter of manners. As an example of American mores, when I say ` How are you?'

 As thousands roared approval, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> moonwalked across the stage and declared, `` I'm bad,'' to open his first solo <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> kicked off the 13-city tour Tuesday at 16,900-seat Kemper Arena, where smoke machines, lasers, and 72 speakers highlighted the performance. <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan leaflets were placed on numerous car in the parking lot, but the only arrest was of a person suspected of being under the influence of alcohol, police said. After another show here tonight, the pop singer moves to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Madison Square Garden in March. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sang 17 songs Tuesday in a two-hour concert that opened with smoke machines churning and the audience bathed in brilliant white lights. An overhead video screen showed the image of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s legs moonwalking across it. Flanked by four dancers, and backed by four singers and a seven-member band, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appeared and slid into non-stop gyrations to the throbbing beat of `` Wan na Be Startin' Somethin','' one of the hits from `` Thriller,'' the 1983 blockbuster album that sold 40 million copies. Many traveled for hours to get to the concert, but perhaps none farther than <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanparys </PERSON>, 27, who came from their home in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> said he also attended the opening of the 1984 Victory Tour by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and members of his musical family. `` I've seen him six times,'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> said. `` He's gotten more mature. He's more of a real person.'' Some said they liked the idea of a solo tour. `` This time we get to focus on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, just his talents,'' said <PERSON> Alonzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` He's trying to prove he's a talent, and not just hype.'' During his rendition of `` Bad,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was lifted on a platform over the heads of the audience. While suspended there, his coat and hair flapped in an artificial breeze as he sang, `` I'm bad, I'm bad. During `` Thriller'' he was enveloped in smoke and threw a white hat to the crowd. Tickets were $ 30 when the Victory tour opened with a concert at <LOCATION> Arrowhead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> football team. This tour, tickets at the much-smaller <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION> were priced at $ 23, but scalpers reportedly were getting up to $ 200.

<HEAD>Disabled Follow Politics But Have Trouble Voting, Poll Suggests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Disabled Americans express greater interest in politics than other citizens, but they register and vote at a rate considerably lower than the general public, according to a recently released survey. `` Our findings suggest that barriers, either external or internal or both, prevent many disabled Americans from converting their exceptionally high political interest into actual electoral activity,'' said <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the poll. The most common barrier cited for disabled people was lack of transportation and difficulty in getting to the polls, problems noted by 29 percent of the respondents. Twenty-one percent said it was difficult to stand or walk. The telephone poll of 536 disabled people nationwide, conducted in June and July 1987, found that 53 percent said they follow government and public affairs most of the time. In comparison, only 26 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults pay attention to politics much of the time, according to a 1984 National Election Study by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>.

 A white man who admitted chasing two blacks with a baseball bat was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service for the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> by a judge trying to help him overcome racial hatred. `` He has been taught to hate black people for some reason,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON>. `` I'm trying to put him in an environment where he can perhaps do some good and learn something about the people he thinks he hates and perhaps learn that his feelings are misguided.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON>, a 21-year-old plumbing company laborer, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation and could have been sentenced to a year in prison, the judge said after sentencing him Tuesday. <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON> was charged in August after he and a group of other whites _ brandishing baseball bats, throwing bottles and shouting racial slurs _ chased two blacks from a transit stop in <LOCATION> Gage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a predominantly white neighborhood on the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON> placed Kalafut under his supervision for one year and ordered him to perform 200 hours of community service work for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. Details of when <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON> will serve the sentence are to be worked out in the next few days by his attorney, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> and the judge. <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> said before the sentencing that <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON> would accept the agreement to perform community service and no appeal would be attempted. `` I think it's a good sentence given the fact that he's basically pleaded guilty to hating a minority group,'' <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> said `` By being with black people, he will have a chance to learn they are no different than he is except that the color of their skin is different. `` I think that is an important lesson for anyone to learn, especially someone who has been involved in this kind of activity,'' <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> said. The attorney said <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON>, who declined to be interviewed, was `` concerned about his own personal safety when he is in the neighborhood of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>,'' located on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. Silver said <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON> also was concerned about being rejected by <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> officials and being `` made the scapegoat in a sort of reverse discrimination.'' But the civil rights organization plans to make sure that does n't happen, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>, president of the South Side branch. `` Certainly we do n't presume there are only white racists or what have you,'' said <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>, who was n't sure what type of work Kalafut would perform. `` Racism can be engendered by anyone inclined to that sort of prejudice.'' <PERSON> Nudelman </PERSON> said that trying to help <PERSON> Kalafut </PERSON> overcome his prejudice against blacks made more sense than sentencing him to jail, `` where he wo n't learn anything except more hatred.'' But the judge warned, `` If he ... does n't do what he's supposed to, he'll come back before me and I'll sentence him to jail.''

<HEAD>Survey Finds Women Out of House But Still in Kitchen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's been a quarter century since <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON> helped launch the women's movement with her book `` The Feminine Mystique,'' but a recent survey indicates women still do most of the cooking and grocery shopping. When most could n't persuade the men they live with to help out, women of all income levels devised their own methods of easing the burden, mainly by cutting the time they spend in the kitchen, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The Times conducted telephone interviews with 1,870 people nationwide between Oct. 29 and Nov. 5 and found that while more women are in the work force and have less time at home, they remain the primary care-givers and the ones who pay attention to `` how, when, what and where their families eat.'' Among married couples surveyed, only 18 percent of men said they do the family's main food shopping; 6 percent more said they share the responsibility with someone else at home. Meanwhile, 91 percent of married women said they do the shopping, with 3 percent saying the chore is shared. Working full time outside the home did n't seem to make much difference. The study found that 90 percent of married women who work full time said they do the principal family shopping. As for preparing meals, 90 percent of married women surveyed said they do most or all the cooking in their homes, compared with just 15 percent of married men. Last month, a magazine survey reported that 77 percent of working mothers queried said they prepare dinner by themselves _ and 64 percent said they do the after-dinner cleanup alone, too. In its February issue, <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mother </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> also reported that its survey found 92 percent of working-mother respondents do the laundry regularly in their households. According to that study, whereas husbands and children do the laundry regularly about 25 percent of the time, 27 percent of husbands never so much as throw a dirty sock into the washing machine. The magazine found that men in higher-income families were much more likely to pitch in than men in lower-income families. Working Mother published its questions in April and drew responses from 2,811 working mothers around the country.

<HEAD>Wheat To Have First Year-To-Year Increase In Four Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The outlook for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat farmers has improved significantly, aided in part by huge subsidized sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. An additional sale of 700,000 metric tons to the Soviets was announced Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Overall, exports are expected to rise more than 50 percent from last year, reducing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpile to the lowest level in six years. In a related analysis, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the rising demand and shrinking inventories have boosted wheat prices well above last year's harvest lows of about $ 2.28 per bushel. Over the entire wheat marketing year, which began last June 1, the national average farm price is expected to be in the range of $ 2.55 to $ 2.65 per bushel, up from $ 2.42 in 1986-87, the report said. That will be the first year-to-year increase since 1983-84. Looking briefly at 1988 harvest prospects, the report noted that plantings of winter wheat last fall for this summer's harvest were the smallest in 10 years. Spring wheat plantings may be up slightly if strong prices entice farmers away from the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 acreage program. `` However, weather remains the leading determinate of 1988's wheat crop,'' the report said The latest sale, equal to about 25.7 million bushels, was handled by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 150,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Tradigrain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 250,000; <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 100,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Peavey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 150,000. At recent prices averaging $ 2.76 per bushel, the wheat would have a farm value of about $ 71 million. That is a five-day average price through Feb. 19, adjusted to reflect prices received by farmers. More than 6.3 million tons of subsidized wheat have been sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, for delivery in the year that began last Oct. 1. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, acting general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said an additional 500,200 tons of wheat are still available to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under current <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> authorization. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> so they can sell a foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive world prices. The sales also are part of the grain the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to buy during the fifth and final year of a long-term agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. The pact expires Sept. 30. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans, or 39.4 bushels of corn. In addition, 1.67 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, 800,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal have been bought by the Soviets for delivery this year.

 Agriculture Department economists say consumers soon will see lower prices for lettuce. `` Lettuce shipments and prices should return to normal this spring as harvesting moves north from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and spring brings improved weather,'' according to a report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Both grower and retail lettuce prices likely will decline to more typical levels.'' Last fall prices soared because `` unusual heat and pest problems reduced yields,'' the report said. In November and December, lettuce sold for $ 20 to $ 25 per carton at <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> shipping points, compared with $ 4 to $ 7 a year earlier. As of early February, prices were ranging between $ 3 and $ 12. `` Prices remained higher than usual during the winter because cold weather and plant disease transmitted by the whitefly reduced midwinter shipments from the <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` The valley usually supplies most of the domestic lettuce supply during midwinter.''

<HEAD>Comments On Aid To Ireland Cause Dustup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The State Department's second-ranking official caused a diplomatic and political dustup last week with his explanation, later partially disavowed, of why the administration wants to shut down its aid program for Ireland. The remarks by Deputy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> generated a stir in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, sent <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> diplomats scurrying to find explanations, and produced expressions of dismay from the `` Shamrock caucus'' in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In the end, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> took the unusual step of issuing a clarification that effectively repudiated part of what <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. At issue is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in the International Fund for <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. American contributions have totaled $ 85 million over the past two years, and $ 35 million is slated for the current year. Most of the money is aimed at promoting economic and social progress in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, now approaching two decades of sectarian strife. Last Thursday, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> went before reporters to explain the administration's foreign aid proposals for 1989, and he was asked why no money was programmed for <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> `` ranks down the list'' of foreign aid priorities, adding that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not get a `` real return'' on its investment despite the emotional and `` maybe political appeal'' of aid to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` Other needs appear to us to be more urgent,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. Both the cutoff decision and the tone of <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>'s remarks were the talk of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> late last week. And there were expressions of concern from two of the best known Irish-Americans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his nephew, Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, both <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrats. The chairman of the congressional Friends of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, D-Mass., said he was outraged The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> came under pressure to clarify <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>'s remarks, and did so over the weekend Privately, one official said that <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> misspoke but the problem was `` how to set the record straight'' without upsetting him. After a day's contemplation, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement expressing strong support for the International Fund even though <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> had said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contributions to it had yielded few benefits. Distancing itself still further from <LOCATION> Whitehead </LOCATION>, the statement said, `` We have been very happy with the progress which the Fund and its governing board have made.'' Beyond that, it even implied that the administration would not be displeased if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> overrode the aid cutoff and earmarked more money for the program. `` Of course, we will be ultimately guided by what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorizes and appropriates and what is signed into law by the president,'' the statement said. There is some dispute as to whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in the program was to be phased out. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> made no reference to any such limit, but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> clarification does allude to a three-year time frame. Irish diplomatic sources, meanwhile, said funding for additional years had never been ruled out. In any case, the statement appears to have calmed <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, where there is a feeling that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wo n't cut the aid program adrift. Contributing to the more relaxed mood was the statement by Rep. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>: `` The Fund has done good work and continues to do so,'' he said. `` I for one will be encouraging my colleagues to consider the economic and symbolic importance of continued <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support for the International Fund.''

 Kansas Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, proclaiming `` we're winning again,'' was heading <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> hopeful his victories in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> would help his Republican presidential campaign in a region where Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the front-runner `` I've got a big hill to climb in the South,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Tuesday night while celebrating his latest victories. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> scheduled four stops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and then planned to head for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator got some help in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Monday when he was endorsed by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, the state's senior officeholder. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the backing of Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. With a Republican primary on March 5, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> opens the Southern phase of the 1988 campaign. Three days later is Super Tuesday, when 20 states, the majority of them in the South, will hold primaries or caucuses. For the second time this busy campaign month, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was heading out of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> with a decisive show of support. Two weeks ago, he won the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> hoping to deliver a killing blow to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> proved to be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> territory and the vice president won the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary and revived his status as <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> front-runner. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was in a black mood after his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> defeat, but upon getting strong backing from voters in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the senator said, `` It's a lot more fun winning.'' As for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s showing _ second in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and fourth in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I really believe when the vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gets 10 percent, or around that area _ the sitting vice president _ and only about 15 percent in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, it's going to send a strong signal to small towns, to farmers, to businessmen and businesswomen.'' `` We're winning again,'' he said. `` We probably had our expectations too high in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and it probably hurt us some around the country. But now we're winning again.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he hoped the results `` send a message that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has a message. That's what the election is all about. I have n't changed my message I've talked about the future, I've talked about leadership, I've talked about party responsibilities, I've talked about the left out and the down-and-out in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, I've talked about the future of our young people.''

 Five radical students armed with bombs and knives seized a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office today and detonated two bombs and started a fire before police overpowered them. Two of the students brandishing explosive devices and draped in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> flags stood at shattered windows on the second floor yelling `` Yankee go home'' as riot police ringed the building. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had no reports of injuries, but the attackers smashed windows and set a fire in a periodical storage room. Thick smoke filled part of the building located in the heart of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. People inside the building at the time of the attack, including at least one American, were not detained by the radicals. The students, who said they were members of the `` Young Student Suicide Group'' claimed they had 18 bombs and screamed at surrounding police to stay away. They tossed down a statement charging the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was attempting to make <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> a colony. `` <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> stay out of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' the students yelled. A police officer said it was unclear how many of the explosive devices the attackers had. The bombs were crude chemical devices, possibly some kind of plastic explosive, he said. About 200 radical students hurling firebombs and rocks clashed with riot police about an hour later outside <LOCATION> Myungdong </LOCATION> Cathedral. Police fired volleys of tear gas at the students who yelled slogans denouncing President-elect <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who is to be sworn in Thursday. Hundreds of protesters had gathered at the cathedral less than a mile from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office earlier in the afternoon for an anti-government protest. `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>,'' the students yelled. Some of the attackers were reading in the office's library when there was a large explosion in a nearby roon and they suddenly pulled out bombs and started screaming slogans, eyewitnesses said. At least one of the attackers pulled out a knife and brandished it, they said. `` He was kind of crazy-eyed,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadden </PERSON>, a visiting American teacher who was reading in the library at the time. The attackers smashed three windows overlooking the main street outside and two of them stood shouting slogans out into the street and brandishing bombs and cigaretee lighters. Riot police stood on the sidewalk below with shields covering their heads and shattered glass covered the street. The students tossed at least one bomb into the street where it exploded harmlessly, eyewitnesses said. A second bomb was tossed out, but did not explode, they said. People caught in the library said the students did not attempt to detain them and they were able to leave after recovering from their initial shock. <PERSON> Wadden </PERSON> said he and other people were prevented from leaving downstairs for up to 10 minutes by building guards. There were about 40 people in the library at the time, most of them Koreans, eyewitnesses said. Police who entered the building by the rear entrance overpowered the protesters about 30 minutes after the attack began. The students were taken out of the building in a bus with covered windows. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> riot police entered the building at their request. Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> arrived at the Lotte Hotel across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office just as the incident ended, officials said. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s inauguration. American diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did not know why the students attacked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facility. `` We have no idea what the motivation was,'' an embassy official said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s chief ally. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact against communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> provides reading material and other materials on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and operates libraries and information centers around the world in conjunction with American embassies. The service office in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> is located about half a mile from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The same office was seized by 73 radical students for four days in May, 1985 as an anti-American protest. They ended the occupation peacefully and some later received prison sentences. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials were unable to explain today how the attackers were able to bring weapons into the well-guarded building. Visitors must pass a metal detector, present identification and have their bags searched and there are police guards inside and outside. The statement by the students denounced <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> as a puppet who had been installed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. South Korean radicals have repeatedly charged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has kept a series of authoritarian governments in power in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general, won the first democratic elections in 16 years last December.

 A retired lawyer who reads dictionaries for fun says too many people are put off by big words. Because so many people suffer from sesquipedalophobia, a fear or hatred of big words, 80-year-old <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Schur </PERSON> has written eight books on the subject. `` This has gone from a hobby with me to a vocation and finally to a matter of sociological and political concern,'' <PERSON> Schur </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Schur </PERSON> has just published his latest book, `` 1000 Most Challenging Words.'' In the next one, `` 1000 Most Obscure Words,'' he plans brief essays on each word's origins and meaning. He believes if a person becomes familiar with a word, he or she will use it. <PERSON> Schur </PERSON>, who received his high school diploma at age 11 and graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at age 17, does not blame weak vocabularies on the educational system. `` There are some well-educated people who do not like you to use big words,'' he said. `` If you use a word that's unfamiliar to them they resent it and this intimidates a lot of people.'' For people who want to improve their vocabulary, <PERSON> Schur </PERSON> suggests they jot down every new word in a notebook, master it and then use it. `` I find reading dictionaries fascinating, but that's not the menu for most people,'' he said.

She said she picked the name by combining her liking for geese with her granddaughter's nickname for her. Ms. <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said the company offered to help <ORGANIZATION> Grammy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goose </ORGANIZATION> design a new sign, phase out printed paper goods and find a new name that retains part of the current name. `` We understand she is a small business and we would like to mitigate the harm to her,'' Ms. <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said. `` We mean her no harm; she is so inflexible.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gotelli </PERSON>'s attorney said the shop owner had made a counter offer to the chip maker: to promise the Grammy Goose name would never be sold to anyone else and would never be used outside of <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Three Candidates Could Lose Matching Funds Eligibility</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Elections Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three presidential candidates faced the prospect of losing future federal matching funds after failing to win at least 10 percent of the vote in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary. Democrats <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> were in jeopardy of losing their eligibility under an election-law stipulation that starts the clock on dropping a candidate from the matching-funds category if he receives less than 10 percent in two successive primaries. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 8 percent and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> each had 5 percent. All three also finished in the single digits in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> last week, in the first primary of the campaign season. Failing to get 10 percent in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> does not mean an immediate cutoff because the law stays such action for 30 days after the primary. And candidates can qualify anew by getting 20 percent of the vote in a future primary. That means <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who are expected to do well in the Super Tuesday primaries on March 8, are likely to score the strong finishes they need before the 30-day stay expires. In 1984, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lost his eligiblity because he fell below the 10 percent threshhold in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. But before the money was actually stopped, he had regained certification by winning 23.6 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Regardless of whether candidates have been disqualified from receiving matching funds to continue their campaigns, they can continue to receive matching payments to retire campaign debts that were incurred before the date of ineligibility, said spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Matching funds from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> have become the manna of presidential campaigns, with the amount distributed to each candidate dependent on how much he raises privately. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> so far this year has handed out close to $ 40 million to 14 candidates. Three of those candidates have already dropped out of the race _ Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and Republicans <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>. The fund matches each contribution of $ 250 or less that a candidate raises privately. The fund is supported by the $ 1 checkoff on individual income tax forms under the public financing system set up in the mid-1970s by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The six-member <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> votes on candidate certification following a review of the campaign's finances by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> audit and legal staff. To be certified, a candidate must raise $ 100,000 across 20 states in contributions of $ 250 or less. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> have received the most matching funds for this year's election, each with more than $ 6.5 million. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has received $ 621,828, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> nearly $ 2 million, and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> $ 1.1 million. At a recent <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting, commissioner <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aikens </PERSON> attacked what she described as an inequity in the law that allows an unopposed third-party candidate, or a candidate who chooses not to compete in every state, to continue receiving federal matching funds while others who place their names on every primary ballot face the risk of cutoff. A candidate whose name is not on the ballot is not covered by the 10 percent rule.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will start removing its shorter-range nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in the next few days, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rude </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravo </ORGANIZATION> said today. Also today, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said the Soviets will begin the early withdrawal of its shorter-range missiles from the Communist German nation this week. The missiles in both countries are included in an arms control agreement signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last December in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> under which all intermediate-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will be scrapped. The Rude Pravo newspaper stressed that the missiles are being taken out of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> before the treaty is ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Word that Soviet missiles will be removed from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> coincided with national celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the Communist takeover in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. The planned removal of the missiles was described by <PERSON> Rude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pravo </PERSON> as a significant gesture by the Kremlin. `` A further expression of good will, similar to -LRB- others -RRB- made by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ... is that according to an agreement with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, it will begin in the next few days to pull out from the territory of both states the missile units equipped with OTR-22 missiles,'' Rude Pravo said. OTR-22 is the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact name for the shorter-range missiles <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> calls SS-12. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has never said how many Soviet missiles were installed on its territory. The only location ever given for the weapons was a military base near <LOCATION> Hranice </LOCATION>, 180 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. In 1983, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> began installing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise and <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 missiles in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to counteract Soviet missiles pointed at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The Kremlin responded by moving some SS-12 missiles from their bases in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, to put them within striking range of the West. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said today in a brief statement: `` Withdrawal of the Soviet shorter-range missiles from the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> will begin'' Thursday. The statement said missiles would be removed that day from two East German sites _ <LOCATION> Bischofswerda </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Waren </PERSON>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> announced last week that SS-12s had been dismantled, put into crates and were ready for transport back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But it did not announced until today when the missiles would be taken out of the country. East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> in January indicated that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could be removed ahead of schedule. According to figures released after the superpower arms treaty was signed, there are 54 SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed In Dull Trading, Gold Also Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was mixed in dull European trading today as dealers waited for new factors to get the market out of the doldrums. Gold prices fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> following a large sell order from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, which had a big impact because the market was so thin, dealers said. Traders said last Friday's remark by <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Languetin </PERSON> that the dollar was poised to move lower again had put a very tight lid on any upward movement of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Dealers said Tuesday's congressional testimony in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> failed to give the market new directions and they did n't expect his repeat performance for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today to have much more impact. The release later today of fourth-quarter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures is n't likely to have a major impact on the market either because the figures are already known, dealers said. `` I honestly do n't know what could help the dollar move,'' said one senior trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. But another dealer said Thursday's report of the first revision of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth could possibly have an effect on the dollar In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.25 yen to a closing 128.75. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted slightly higher at 128.85 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's rates: _ 1.69225 West German marks, down from 1.6945 _ 1.3905 Swiss francs, up from 1.3895 _ 5.72675 French francs, up from 5.7240 _ 1.89775 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9000 _ 1,247.00 Italian lire, up from 1.246.60 _ 1.2673 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2712 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the It cost $ 1.7665 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.7655 late Tuesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 441.70 a troy ounce and at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a lower recommended price of $ 438. Both were down from late Tuesday's bid of $ 442.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 438.50, down from $ 442 late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 2.60 to close at a bid $ 444.20. Silver also fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> where the bid price was $ 6.28 a troy ounce at midmorning today compared with late Tuesday's $ 6.33.

 A bus driver was arrested after allegedly beating a passenger who boarded his bus without exact change, police said.

<HEAD>27 U.S. Servicemen Detained After Noriega's Son-In-Law Stopped For
Speeding</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Panamanian police detained more than two dozen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen without charges after the son-in-law of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military strongman was held for speeding at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installation. Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel were stopped and briefly held Tuesday, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On Monday, Panamanian police detained 25 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen for two hours before releasing them without filing charges, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The servicemen were picked up while driving to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations inside the former <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Zone. The State Department planned to protest the detentions, said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said the detentions came a day after Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s son-in-law was stopped in the canal zone. He declined to give the son-in-law's name, but said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s daughter and two other passengers were in the car when it was stopped Sunday night for speeding and passing in a no-passing zone at the <ORGANIZATION> Albrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, outside of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The son-in-law allegedly became abusive with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> security policeman who stopped him. He could not produce identification, the source said. At that point, the policeman `` restrained'' him, put him in handcuffs and took him to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> police station for processing, the source said. The son-in-law was released about an hour after being stopped, he said. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> police stopped 25 servicemen. The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most were driving motorcycles to installations inside the former canal zone, but two were driving cars and one was walking. Col. <PERSON> Leonidas </PERSON> <PERSON> Macias </PERSON>, chief of police for the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, denied police detained the servicemen. He said officers merely stopped them to check for drivers' licenses and remind them that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel are forbidden to wear uniforms outside of the former canal zone. The detentions marked the latest sign of deteriorating relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since last June, when demonstrations broke out in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> demanding the resignation of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the armed forces chief. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has publicly called for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down following his indictment on drug trafficking charges this month by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Coastal Commission Approves Exxon Platforms Off Santa Barbara
County</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has approved a $ 2.5 billion plan for three offshore oil platforms in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>, a plan first proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in 1981. On an 8-2 vote, with one commissioner abstaining, the commission approved <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for the platforms, a marine terminal and onshore facility in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flores </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>. But the plan, which would more than double the state's oil production, requires major changes in <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s production methods. The company must dismantle an offshore treatment and storage ship now in use, commission spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebster </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We're talking about state-of-the-art air pollution control to reduce the current levels,'' he said. `` Even with the expansion, this will result in a reduction of emissions.'' A 1987 agreement on air pollution controls was instrumental in breaking a political deadlock over <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plan, commission Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wornum </PERSON> said. The company is producing up to 40,000 barrels a day on Platform Hondo, located between coastal <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. It processes the oil on an offshore vessel, a converted oil tanker moored in federal waters 3.1 miles offshore. In 1984 the oil company sued the commission, and later sued <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, over its demands that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> stop using the converted tanker. In 1986 it renewed its lawsuit and issued an appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Commission approval was the result of compromises reached on all sides, including environmentalists, who agreed with Tuesday's decision, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Faust </PERSON>, another commission spokesman Following the vote, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leftgoff </PERSON>, spokesman for the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Get </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Out </ORGANIZATION>, said the Exxon project is `` the best that we could hope for in a regulatory environment.''

<HEAD>Rights Group: Death Squad Activity Increasing In Honduras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Honduran death squads linked to the military have stepped up their campaign of terror, targeting opposition leaders, human rights activists, students and peasants, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today. `` Serious human rights violations, including arbitrary arrests, torture and ill-treatment are widespread in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and show no signs of diminishing,'' the London-based human rights organization said in a report. The group said many of the abuses arose during strikes, disputes over farm land or army operations against leftist guerrillas. The group also said it remains concerned about the government's failure to investigate reports of more than 100 people who disappeared between 1980 and 1984. In the report, titled `` <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>: Civilian Authority, <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>,'' Amnesty based its findings on interviews with senior government and military officials and non-government sources during two visits to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> last year. The group said recent abuses include bombings, arbitrary detentions, death threats and harassment of critics of the government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>. Despite a civilian government, the 17,500-man army wields great power. Victims include human rights figures, opposition leaders, members of labor organizations, students and peasants, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. The victims described severe beatings, electric shocks and sexual abuse. The group said patterns of abuse changed since the early 1980s, when it said abductions and executions were carried out systematically by order of the armed forces. The alleged abuses fell off after 1984, but the death squads have apparently begun a new campaign of intimidation in the last two years, the report said. Death squads were believed to have been involved in three killings last month, it said. Two people shot to death in January were to have testified against the government in a human rights case before the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Amnesty blamed most of the recent alleged human rights abuses on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> said is part of the police but actually is controlled by the military. The report quoted a former member of Battalion 3-16, which it said was a secret military intelligence unit, as saying he and other members of the group were secretly trained by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military in 1981. The unidentified man was quoted as saying that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials discouraged torture but had trained the unit in methods of physical coercion. Since 1981, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has made <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> a key ally for policy aimed at containing the leftist Sandinista government in neighboring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. A series of joint military exercises have been held, almost continously, for the past five years. A permanent American military presence is maintained at <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> Air Base near <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> and at other facilities, totaling more than 1,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid program grew from $ 8.9 million in 1981 to $ 88.8 million for 1986.

<HEAD>Mofford Could Be Drafted in Recall Without Resigning, Corbin Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Acting Gov. Rose Mofford may be able to run for governor in a May 17 recall election without giving up her position as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, the state's attorney general said. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, in a non-binding opinion issued Tuesday, said that if Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> is drafted instead of declaring herself a candidate, she would not have to resign as secretary of state. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who became acting governor following the impeachment of Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on Feb. 5, has not said whether she is interested in running, and had no comment Tuesday on the possibility of a draft. As governor, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would automatically be on the recall ballot, but his status is clouded by his impeachment and impending trial before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and a criminal trial scheduled for March. Democrat <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, who lost to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in a three-way race in 1968, and Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> have indicated they will be candidates in the recall election. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, faces a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial Monday on charges that he hid a $ 350,000 campaign loan, misused $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership, and tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official. A criminal trial is scheduled for March 22 on felony charges of concealing the $ 350,000 loan. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s resign-to-run law requires officeholders who run for another position to resign unless they are in the last year of their current term. Rep. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON>, a Democrat, had asked <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> whether a draft of an officeholder as a gubernatorial candidate would require that person to resign. Ms. <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON> said she expects a draft-Mofford movement to be started, but said she did not plan to be involved. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> announced Tuesday that former Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> would be his honorary campaign chairman. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in the 1986 campaign, but now says that was a mistake. In accepting the position, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> said: `` You look back over all the governors that we've had in this state. We've had some darn good ones and we've had some mediocre ones, but it took us a long time to get a really bad one.''

 The concert pianist <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, hailed as one of the century's most distinguished pianists but forced to cut short his career because of a stroke, has died at age 85, his family said. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, born <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutner </PERSON> but known professionally by his first name only, died Feb. 2, his family announced Tuesday. No cause of death was given. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> was born Aug. 9, 1902, one of seven children in a family in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s rough East End. At age 7 he began studying music. One of his fellow students became the Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON>, mother of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> made his concert hall debut when he was 8 years old, playing playing <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s B flat Concerto and the slow movement of <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s First Concerto at the Queen's Hall in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He later appeared again at the Queen's Hall, under conductor Sir <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, playing <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Third Concerto and <PERSON> Liszt </PERSON>'s Hungarian Fantasy, and in 1911 undertook his first British tour The same year he played to the royal family at <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, and his career as a child prodigy was established. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> appeared with many of the world's most famous conductors and orchestras, but by the time he was 16, he had tired of the concert hall circuit and temporarily quit to resume his musical studies. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> wrote in his autobiography that the young <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> told him he had `` no boy's interests, no games,'' because of his career. `` As he said, it had been piano, piano, and nothing but piano,'' wrote <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> resumed his concert hall career in 1921, made his American debut in 1926, and was one of the world's most sought-after pianists until suffering a debilitating stroke in 1956. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> wrote: `` He developed his technical virtuosity to the highest pitch, but his outstanding quality was the intellectual insight and poetry of feeling which he brought to the keyboard repertory, from <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> to <PERSON> Debussy </PERSON>.'' Another <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> paper, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, wrote: `` <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>'s clarity of articulation, his warm, soft-grained tone, musical accuracy and honesty of purpose shone through all his performances, and his virtuosity was so formidable as to be unnoticeable. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Gwendoline </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, who was one of his former pupils.

 <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is developing a laptop computer which it hopes to introduce next year, according to a computer magazine which printed details of the secret project. The article in this week's edition of Macintosh Today details the size, appearance and technical specifications of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> laptop model. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that the article was based on a confidential document given to a free-lance writer by an <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> employee. `` We do n't comment on rumors of products which may or may not come to market,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Krause </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The magazine article describes a 12-pound laptop with a flat-panel monitor called an active matrix screen and a central processor that can run Macintosh software using only a fraction of the power used by most desktop models. The magazine said the system will come with 1 megabyte of internal memory, the same as the Macintosh SE. It will be powered by a five-pound lead-acid battery that will last up to 10 hours before recharging. The <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> is not expected to join the $ 1 billion laptop market until next year.

 President-elect <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo will be sworn in Thursday in the first peaceful transfer of power in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s turbulent history with a promise to end authoritarian rule and usher in full democracy. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> will take the oath of office as the 6th president at a heavily-guarded ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> with no general public participation. Outgoing President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> and other leaders will attend the ceremony. The inauguration also will mark the start of the <LOCATION> Sixth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> as the country adopts a new constitution that provides for greater political and individiual freedoms. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has promised the republic will be `` the great era of the common man.'' The charismatic <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, 55, is committed to ending the nation's long tradition of authoritarian rule that strictly limited political activity and ruthlessly cracked down on opposition He also has pledged to end the country's confrontational politics and violent regional divisions and to redress social and economic inequality. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> on Monday called for a government that `` is loved by the people and run in accordance with democratic principles to suit a new era.'' The new president faces the challenge of ending authoritarian rule in a nation that has never had a peaceful transfer of power. The nation has been dominated by civilian and military strongmen since its creation in 1948 and its politics are turbulent and often violent. Police were on alert in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities today after reports that radical students and dissidents may attempt to stage anti-Roh protests. Radical groups have refused to recognize <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s election and contend he is intent on continuing authoritarian rule Radical groups called for anti-government protests in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities today and Thursday. Detachments of riot police were seen guarding key points in some areas of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and police officials said reserves were on alert. More than 200 student and dissident leaders were being watched in case they attempted to organize protests, officials said. Police also were guarding festive arches erected in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for the inauguration in case dissidents attempted to wreck them. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> warned at a farewell dinner in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> tonight that political stability and continued expansion were vital. He warned against political unrest. `` I am convinced that there must not, and will not, be any repeat of political chaos that imperils the country or social chaos that threatens national survival,'' he said. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who took power with military backing in 1980 when he and <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> were senior generals, is to head a presidential advisory board. He was to leave office in a separate ceremony Thursday. A low-key inaugural ceremony was planned for Thursday with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> scheduled to take the oath of office in the square in front of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> building. But attendance was by invitation only and there were no plans for celebrations or public attendance. Factory workers, street cleaners and other ordinary people were invited to attend the ceremony along with officials, academics, and other representatives of Korean society, officials said. Envoys from 88 nations, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the premiers of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, were to attend the inauguration. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was to be represented by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won the country's first democratic presidential election in 16 years on Dec. 16 with 36.6 percent of the vote. He defeated rival opposition candidates <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, who split the opposition vote. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general, is identified with the military-backed governments that have ruled the country since 1961 and many Koreans are doubtful if he can achieve massive democratic change. Opposition parties contend <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s inauguration will simply signal a change of figurehead and the government will continue to be run by the armed forces and an entrenched elite of government officials and business leaders.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of leftist demonstrators marched on a military camp today and accused the government of betraying the revolution that swept President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power two years ago. About 200 policemen blocked the road leading to Camp Crame as helicopters patrolled overhead. But the crowd, estimated at 20,000 people by police, was peaceful. The rally was held on a boulevard between Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo. Two years ago, hundreds of thousands of Filipinos flocked there and prevented troops loyal to then-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from attacking rebellious soldiers holed up in Crame. The four-day standoff ended with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' depature from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Today's marchers included students, workers, farmers, nuns and priests. They chanted `` dismantle the U.S.-Aquino regime'' and carried effigies of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. Red banners said, `` Advance the People's Genuine Revolution,'' and one poster read: `` Cory _ Closet Dictator.'' The protesters denounced what they said was Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s failure to put in place the sweeping economic and political reforms she had promised during the 1986 presidential election `` We had high hopes when <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she would be the exact opposite of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. But after two years, we have no more hope that she will fulfill her promises,'' <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON>, head of the militant May 1st Movement labor organization, told the rally. Some of the protesters distributed leaflets of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization of 12 Marxist groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> and its armed wing, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Aquino government has betrayed the Filipino people's hope for fundamental changes in society after ousting <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ...,'' a leaflet said. It accused the government of incompetence and `` subservience to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' The crowd dispersed without incident after about three hours. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, however, congratulated the Aquino government today on molding a democratic government. `` What we have seen happen in this period is impressive,'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said in a statement. `` A constitution has been written and ratified by an overwhelming margin ... A new congress has been freely elected and is vigorously functioning. Local elections have been held in every province, city and town throughout the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Archipelago </LOCATION>. `` In these and mnay other ways democracy has been restored in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' he said. In other developments, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> defended her embattled <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, Gen. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, and credited him with blocking attempts by renegade military officers to topple her government. She said `` as far as I'm concerned, General -LRB- Fidel -RRB- <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> has proven himself not only now but in the past, especially in his abiding by the constitution. He has not been any part of any coup attempt.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made the remark to reporters one day after the wife of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain linked to at least two coup attempts and the assassination of a leftist labor leader hinted that <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> was involved in a November 1986 conspiracy. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said that he, in fact, exposed the coup attempt.

 An unusually well-preserved fossil skull stumbled upon by a graduate student belongs to one of the smallest baleen whales ever known, scientists said. The skull and other parts of the 15-foot whale, believed to be 12 million to 14 million years old and possibly related to modern toothless whales, were found embedded in a sandstone bluff on <LOCATION> Ano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 19 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. The 35-pound skull is a `` beautiful specimen,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, a professor of natural history at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruz </ORGANIZATION>. `` -LRB- It's -RRB- one of the best I know of,'' <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, a world authority on whales, said at a news conference Tuesday. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadley </PERSON>, 26, a UC-Santa <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> graduate student, said he spotted the skull as an irregularity in a rock formation last May while visiting <LOCATION> Ano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> with a group studying elephant seals. A closer look revealed that it was a whale skull. `` Since I did n't have the usual tools of a paleontologist, I modified a rusty pipe to excavate the fossil,'' <PERSON> Fadley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said it was unusual to find a cetacean skull with the delicate earbones intact. Those tiny bones could help researchers learn how whales and other marine mammals developed their exceptionally acute hearing, he said. The animal itself, 15 feet long and weighing 1,500 pounds, apparently was an adult pygmy baleen whale `` with close linkage to the modern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whale,'' <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> grays can be as long as 40 feet long and weigh 40 tons. Baleen whales, which include the 100-foot blue whale, have no teeth but eat by filtering plankton and tiny crustaceans from seawater with bristly baleen plates attached to their upper jaw.

 An 18-year-old British soldier was charged today with unlawfully killing an unarmed Roman Catholic civilian in a case that has further strained tense Anglo-Irish relations. The soldier, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, appeared at <ORGANIZATION> Cookstown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and Irish leaders met across the border in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> to discuss the deterioration in relations. In addition to the <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> case, tensions have increased because of the disclosure Tuesday that another British soldier jailed for murdering an unarmed Roman Catholic civilian was freed on parole after serving three years. Magistrate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> held in police custody until a court appearance in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on March 9. The defense said it would appeal to the High Court for bail to be set. <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>'s attorney said the soldier will plead innocent to the charge of unlawfully killing <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>, 23, an election worker for <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political arm of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was killed Sunday by a ricocheting bullet after a machine gun was fired accidentally from an army observation post at a checkpoint near <LOCATION> Aughnacloy </LOCATION>, half a mile from the border in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Tuesday rebuked Irish Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>'s government for ordering its own investigation into the shooting. British officials said they already were investigating. Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> paid a courtesy call on <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> before he joined Irish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenihan </PERSON> and Justice Minister <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> today for a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference. The main item on the agenda was proposed British legislation aimed at guaranteeing a fair division of employment between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Before entering the meeting, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said: `` We will be talking about all matters of concern to us both and we shall be having very frank and valuable discussions. This is the value of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. It means we can meet to discuss very difficult issues.'' The Anglo-Irish Agreement, signed in November 1985, gives the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government a consultative role in the running of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The conference was set up as a forum for Irish and British ministers to discuss problems in the province, where the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule. On Tuesday, security forces ringed Aughnacloy for McAnespie's funeral Cardinal <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiaich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> primate of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> who broke off a trip to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to attend the funeral, told the congregation <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> had been murdered. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> was buried across the border in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiaich </PERSON> said he has never hesitated to condemn <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> killings as murder, adding: `` How can I now avoid using this term ` murder' to describe the killing in broad daylight of one of the best known and most highly respected men in this parish?'' Anglo-Irish relations have been severely strained recently by a series of disputes, principally <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s refusal after a long inquiry to prosecute <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> policemen who shot and killed six unarmed Catholics in 1982. News that a British soldier sentenced to life in prison for murdering an unarmed Roman Catholic civilian, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, 22, in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> in 1983 was freed on parole after serving only three years has added to that tension. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in a statement Tuesday confirmed Irish news reports that Pvt. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thain </PERSON>, who was jailed for murdering <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> during rioting in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on Aug. 9, 1983, had been freed on parole in February 1987. <PERSON> Thain </PERSON>, 21, said at his trial he thought <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, road manager of the pop group <LOCATION> Bananarama </LOCATION>, was reaching for a gun, but the judge dismissed his claim. Upon hearing of <PERSON> Thain </PERSON>'s release, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, said: `` It is unbelievable. People talk about <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> justice but where is it today? Our son was never involved in anything. He was murdered.''

Although the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government has banned panda hunting, the pandas' numbers are believed to have decreased as a result of their low fertility rate, a shortage of the wild bamboo on which they feed and human predators.

<TEXT>
 The meter has expired on penny parking in this western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town, where selectmen voted to eliminate one-cent meters on two downtown streets to raise more money. Selectmen voted Tuesday to boost the parking rates on Main and Federal streets, the two busiest streets in the downtown commercial district, to five cents for 15 minutes, 10 cents for 30 minutes and 20 cents for an hour. Motorists will still be able to park on side streets for a penny and a nickel. The new meter heads will also have quarter slots, but 25 cents will still get you only an hour's parking, selectman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> said. An advisory committee urged the town in January to boost the rates, maintaining it was costing the town of 19,100 people more to collect the pennies than it was getting in meter revenue. The new meters, which officials said should be installed in about two months, are expected to generate an additional $ 36,000 in revenue annually. The town now gets about $ 70,000 from its parking meters.

<TEXT>
 Programs aimed at helping <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s preschool children resist sexual abuse are ineffective and should be phased out, a federally funded study said The programs are beyond the understanding of such young children, may frighten them away from normal affection and unjustly make them responsible for the behavior of others, researchers said Tuesday. `` The central idea of training the children bears rethinking,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, professor of social welfare at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. `` We should not make 4-year-olds responsible for defending themselves,'' said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, who conducted the two-year study for <ORGANIZATION> UC-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Programs that try to train preschool children to recognize and resist sexual abuse reach 42,000 younsters throughout the state. The study of 118 preschoolers in seven counties found that attempts to teach very young children the difference between a `` good touch'' and a `` bad touch'' may confuse them. Defining a `` bad touch'' as anything that `` feels bad'' results in children resisting any contact they do not like at the moment, such as <PERSON> Grandma </PERSON>'s `` yucky'' kiss, Uncle <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>'s scratchy cheek and the tight hug from a well-meaning relative, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said. `` Thus, in the most inclusive view of ` bad touch,' children are taught that virtually a pat on the head could be cause for reporting to the authorities,'' the report said. The report also said responsibility for protecting children lies with adults and not with the youngsters themselves. Teaching 4-year-olds they must `` take charge to control the outside world ... is an abdication of family and social responsibility'' and a `` sorry message of these times,'' researchers said. However, teaching parents alone will not make children safe from sexual abuse, said <PERSON> Pnina </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>, executive director of the San Francisco-based Children's Self-Help Project, one of the programs studied. `` It does no good just to -LRB- educate -RRB- the adults around the child,'' she said. `` What if that adult is the offender? The child is not protected. They must know there are others they can talk to.''

 A sorority formed by lesbians has been officially recognized by <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>, reportedly the first such recognition extended by any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> university.

He said he called the press conference because `` the credibility of the commission is at stake.'' <PERSON> Roa </PERSON> distributed copies of documents that included a purported confidential <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memo on <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> and Cuban arguments against points made in the memo. <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON>, named late last year to head the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the 43-nation <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, has been a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen since January 1987. In January 1961, <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> was sentenced to 30 years in prison in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He was freed after 22 years following the intervention of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> gained international attention during his incarceration by writing poetry that he managed to smuggle out of prison. In a book he wrote about his prison years, titled `` Against All Hope,'' <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> says he was arrested and jailed because he voiced his opposition to communism under Cuban leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roa </PERSON> said, `` The book is full of lies, and it is boring.'' <PERSON> Roa </PERSON> repeated Cuban allegations that <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> was jailed because he belonged to a group that was planning terrorist activities to overthrow the government. He read from what he said was the record of <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON>' trial, saying <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> was convicted of `` planning to take up arms with the purpose of overthrowing through violent means the powers of the state.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> was not charged with terrorism at his trial and that such allegations only arose later. <PERSON> Roa </PERSON> alleged that <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> had been a police officer under the government of dictator <PERSON> Fulgencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Batista </PERSON>, who was ousted in 1959 by <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> loyalists, but he said <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> was never penalized for this. He denied that the Cubans had charged <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> belonged to <PERSON> Batista </PERSON>'s secret police. However, a reproduction of an article in the French newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, included in the package of documents distributed by the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> delegation, quotes <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> was a member of the `` Gestapo of <PERSON> Batista </PERSON>.'' A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Roa </PERSON> was `` lying'' when he said <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> had been a policeman. `` They keep altering their story every year, trying to make it more acceptable,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had also at one time accused <PERSON> Valladares </PERSON> of being a torturer but that the country now denies having said that.

 With one lucky rifle shot, a young man troubled by a compulsion to take four-hour showers and wash his hands up to 50 times a day cured his affliction. The man, identified as <PERSON> George </PERSON>, failed in a suicide attempt, but the .22 - caliber bullet he fired into his mouth lodged in the lower part of his brain's left frontal lobe, a region believed related to so-called obsessive-compulsive `` If it had gone to the center, it would have killed him,'' his psychiatrist, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON>, said Tuesday. `` If it had gone to the right, it would have had no effect.'' Victims of obsessive-compulsive disorder, like <PERSON> George </PERSON>, suffer from extreme hesitation and doubtfulness, <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> said. `` They hesitate so much that after closing the door they are not really certain they closed the door, so they have to go back again and again.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> was nearly 18 when he fired the bullet into his brain. `` He was found lying on his face, blood oozing from his nostrils,'' said <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON>, who practices at <LOCATION> Shaughnessy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> recovered from the shooting in three weeks. `` We started on behavior therapy,'' <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> said. `` But he was no longer obsessive.'' It was the only change that <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> could find. `` His I.Q. did not change. There was no change personality-wise. He did not become an automaton. His symptoms are gone,'' <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> said. Before the suicide attempt, <PERSON> George </PERSON> washed his hands as often as 50 times a day. He would take four-hour showers, and would check and re-check to see whether doors and windows were locked and whether he had enough money in his wallet. When he pulled the trigger, <PERSON> George </PERSON> may have in effect given himself a lobotomy. Or, more precisely, a leukotomy _ a severing of the links between the frontal lobes and other parts of the brain, rather than a removal of brain tissue as in a lobotomy. `` In the'40s and'50s, psychosurgeons would get these patients and have reasonably good results cutting the pathway between the front part of the brain and a part called the striatum,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Insel </PERSON>, a psychiatrist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. Such surgery has fallen out of favor as effective drugs have been found. <PERSON> Insel </PERSON>, who has specialized in this disorder, said sophisticated brain images called PET scans show that the frontal lobes are more active in obsessive-compulsive patients than in normal people. That suggests that the source of the disorder lies at least partly in the frontal lobes, he said. <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> reported <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s case in the December issue of the British Journal of Psychiatry. A short report of that study appears this week in a newsletter for doctors called Physician's Weekly, which describes the suicide attempt as `` successful radical surgery.'' <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> said <PERSON> George </PERSON> was goaded into the suicide attempt several years ago by his mother. `` She said, ` So look <PERSON> George </PERSON>, if your life is so wretched, just go and shoot yourself,''' <PERSON> Solyom </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapoport </PERSON>, also of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said that <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s accident is reminiscent of the incident early in this century that led to the discovery of the frontal lobotomy. A <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> railroad worker named <PERSON> Phineas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> suffered an accident in which a piece of a crowbar became lodged in his head, she said. The crowbar was removed. `` Amazingly he survived,'' she said. `` In those days, the risk of infection was high. What was remarkable was his personality change. He became a happy-go-lucky bum who sang for his supper and wandered. And somebody studied this.'' <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> had had the first lobotomy.

<HEAD>Panel's Chairman Urges $2 Billion in New Spending</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s AIDS commission called today for spending an additional $ 2 billion to fight the disease among drug abusers. Retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> proposed that half of the money should be in federal funds with the rest coming from state and local sources. The additional $ 1 billion in federal spending called for in the chairman's recommendations to the full 13-member commission would nearly double the total $ 1.3 billion <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> requested for all AIDS education and research in the budget he submitted last week. But <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told reporters only 15 percent of the nation's estimated 1.3 million intravenous drug abusers are in treatment plans, with long waiting lists in many cities for people seeking help in kicking drugs `` Anyone crying for help should get help on demand,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. Moreover, he said, the sharply higher spending on drug treatment must be a `` sustained emphasis. You can not just throw in some money one year and drop it out next year.'' Although male homosexuals still make up the largest percentage of people with AIDS, health officials have determined that the disease is spreading most rapidly now among intravenous drug abusers and their sexual partners. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' recommendations go to the full commission for action Monday; the panel expects to present an interim report to the president the following week. The former chief of naval operations acknowledged that his recommendation for sharply higher spending on drug treatment programs might spark controversy by opening the way for criticism of the administration for not doing more in that area. But he expessed confidence the full commission would adopt that and most of his other recommendations for an interim report and said, `` It is not in our charter to worry about the political impact.'' Asked his reaction to the likelihood that presidential candidates, particularly Democrats, would use his recommendations to `` zing the White House,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> replied: `` How do you avoid politicizing something in an election year. If they all adopt this and say ` Let's get on with it,' that's the kind of politization I like.'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' proposal on drug treatment calls specifically for adding 32,000 drug abuse treatment specialists and said 3,300 new treatment facilities may have to be added. In other areas, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> called for more financial support for the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to double the number of scientists reviewing AIDS-related products and a program of direct grants to community-based drug testing programs. He also made a number of recommendations in the health care area, including more training for doctors. `` Many physicians are severely lacking in knowledge about AIDS and there are signs that medical schools have not yet built up a curriculum to educate doctors about AIDS treatment,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. The interim report will not include any recommendations on the controversial areas of AIDS testing, discrimination against people testing positive for the virus and other social and legal aspects. To try to adopt recommendations in those areas would result in the commission's being `` at loggerheads with ourselves'' at this time. But he said hearings on those topics are scheduled next month in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and promised the panel would not shy away from addressing them in its final report June 24.

 A woman apparently kidnapped a 5-week-old baby because she had an abortion recently, authorities said after they returned the infant to her ecstatic mother. <PERSON> Maritza </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON>, a 38-year-old psychotherapist arrested Tuesday, was being held today on $ 8,000 bond for investigation of second-degree kidnapping in the abduction of 5-week-old <PERSON> Rachael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, police said. <PERSON> Rachael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> was found at Mrs. <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON>' home a day after the girl's mother issued a nationwide plea for the baby's safe return <PERSON> Rachael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> had been kidnapped from her home Friday by a woman answering a babysitting ad, police said. `` It appears it was a replacement baby,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernier </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON> gave a statement to police saying she told her husband when he came home from work Friday that she had had a baby that day by Caesarian section, said police Capt. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. Investigators said they did not know how long Mrs. <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON> was pregnant when the abortion was performed on Oct. 27 for medical reasons. Details were sketchy, but apparently doctors decided she could n't bring the baby to term, police said. Police also have not determined whether <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON> was aware his wife's pregnancy was terminated. <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON>, a 36-year-old clinical psychologist and behavioral science instructor at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, was being questioned, authorities said. <PERSON> Rachael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Cora </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, was elated after being reunited with her baby. `` I thought I loved her all I could until this happened, but now I know I love her even more,'' said <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, who was at work at a pizza parlor when the abduction occurred. Of Mrs. <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON>, she said: `` I feel very sorry for her, that she'd have to do something like this But I'm angry. I still do n't understand it. The woman who kidnapped the baby matched Mrs. <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON>'s description `` like a mirror,'' said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> McElderry </PERSON> The woman was applying for a babysitting position at the home of <PERSON> Rachael </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>'s grandmother, <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> gave the child to the woman while she went to answer the telephone; when she returned, the woman had fled with the child, authorities said. A tip led police to the Rentzes, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>, a neighbor in the subdivision where the Rentzes moved last summer, said he became suspicous after he and his wife saw the baby and thought it did not look newborn. He said he contacted <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> police. Investigators went to the home Tuesday as <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON> was leaving for work in a car that matched a description of the car police were seeking in the abduction, authorities said. Police found the baby in a crib and were shown a false birth certificate with `` Penrose Hospital'' handwritten on a gold seal, police said. But after an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent looked at the child's navel and noticed the umbilical cord knot was gone _ an indication the baby was older than four days _ Mrs. <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON> was arrested, authorities said. Mrs. <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON> came into her office at about 9 a.m. Friday, but stayed only about 30 minutes, said receptionist <PERSON> Meda </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>. According to police documents, friends were told Mrs. <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON> had given birth at 9:42 that morning. She said her baby was named <PERSON> Aurora </PERSON> <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON>. On Oct. 31, shortly after she lost her own baby, Mrs. <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON> put an ad in a newspaper offering her services as a counselor. Her business cards referred to her as a psychotherapist offering `` parent-child consultations,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>. A month later, on Dec. 1, she set up a family counseling practice, the newspaper said. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> criminal psychiatrist, said women who kidnap babies often have lost a child of their own. `` The need to have a baby is so great, they do n't really face up to what they are doing, or they convince themselves that what they are doing is right,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A claim that fallout from the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident may have caused deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is highly unlikely and based on an erroneous statistical analysis, scientists say. A researcher, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, said he found an unexplained jump in the nation's deaths in the months following the Chernobyl accident. However, the amount of radiation that reached the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is so small that the notion is `` not credible,'' <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> radiation expert <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, who serves on a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> committee studying health effects of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, called the hypothesis `` a mechanism which most knowledgeable radiobiologists would throw out because of the very low doses involved.'' A federal health statistics official says no mysterious increase in deaths occurred. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said he will present his work Thursday at a meeting on radiation and the immune system in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, a fellow of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, says federal statistics show an unexplained jump of maybe 20,000 to 40,000 deaths in the nation for May through August of 1986, following the Soviet accident in April. Radioactive fallout from Chernobyl is `` the only explanation we've been able to develop,'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said in a recent interview. The hypothesis, which he stressed was not proven, is that fallout reaching the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> encouraged formation of `` free radicals,'' chemically reactive molecules that can damage cells. These molecules, the hypothesis continues, may have weakened the immune systems of some people enough to make them vulnerable to fatal diseases. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said slightly more than 33 percent of all 1986 deaths occurred in May through August, up from the average of about 32 percent for the three prior years and the highest percentage since 1900. Increases appeared among people older than 65 and those who suffered from infectious diseases, including pneumonia, he said. The study also looked at peak concentrations of iodine-131, a radioactive component of fallout, reported in milk during the summer of 1986. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said that among the nation's nine census regions, higher concentrations were associated with greater increases in mortality for the summer of 1986 compared to the previous summer. The study's data on deaths came from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, chief of the center's mortality statistics branch, said Tuesday his analysis found no inexplicable jump in deaths `` We did n't see anything that departs from the historic pattern,'' he said. `` His numbers are not consistent with the numbers that are adjusted to represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a whole.'' <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> also said 1986 had the lowest death rate ever recorded for the nation, when the population's changing age composition is taken into account. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a radiation biologist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said he was skeptical of the Chernobyl hypothesis after starting to study information <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> sent him. The maximum dose of Chernobyl radiation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was only about 1 percent of the normal background exposure, he said. People eat radioactive material constantly, from natural and man-made sources, so `` there is nothing unique'' about swallowing the tiny amounts of radioactive iodine from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> fallout, he said.

<HEAD>Court Expand Communities' Power to Impose Rent Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today expanded the power of communities to impose rent controls, ruling that hardships to tenants may be considered when landlords seek rent increases. By a 6-2 vote, the justices upheld a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, ordinance that has been attacked as a `` Robin Hood'' law that steals from the rich to pay the poor. While some 200 cities nationwide have rent control laws, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> hardship provision appears to be unique. Landlord groups have said other communities now may adopt similar laws. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, in his opinion for the court, said landlords failed to prove that the ordinance deprived them of the value of their property without just compensation. He rejected the landlords' claim that the city unlawfully is seeking to alleviate hardships for tenants by imposing financial burdens on the property owners. `` We have long recognized that a legitimate and rational goal of price or rate regulation is the protection of consumer welfare,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. The ordinance `` represents a rational attempt to accommodate the conflicting interests of protecting tenants from burdensome rent increases while at the same time ensuring that landlords are guaranteed a fair return of their investment.'' Today's decision does not rule out all challenges to such oridinances. But <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said to win their case landlords at least must show actual losses suffered because communities lowered rents to lessen tenants' hardships. There was no such evidence in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> also noted that rent controls are based on the idea that without them housing shortages would permit landlords to gouge renters. The impact of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> ordinance has been muted, at least temporarily, because vacancy rates have been around 8 percent with the downturn in the local high-technology economy. That has made it less likely that landlords, concerned about losing tenants, will increase rents sufficiently to prompt challenges based on hardship. Justices <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> dissented today. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, writing for both, said the tenant hardship provision takes private property without just compensation in violation of the Constitution. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> denounced `` the unfairness of making one citizen pay, in some fashion other than taxes, to remedy a social problem that is none of his creation.'' The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> law generally permits annual rent increases of 8 percent on residential property. But if the landlord seeks more than that, it opens the way for challenge by `` hardship'' tenants who are defined as earning less than 80 percent of the median income for the area. The landlords said that means individuals making $ 34,000 a year can qualify as hardship cases. The ordinance, passed in 1979, provides a hearing before a city officer to determine if a challenged rent increase is too great. The increase can be rolled back even below 8 percent for hardship tenants if the hearing officer decides a smaller increase is justified. The landlord still would receive an increase of 5 percent plus enough to cover capital improvements and increased rehabilitation, maintenance and other costs. No landlord in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> alleged that the law actually has been implemented to deprive owners of their property's full value. Landlords challenged the law's constitutionality shortly after it was adopted. They said the ordinance, in effect, is a Robin Hood statute that requires them to assume the public burden of subsidizing low-income tenants. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, reversing rulings by lower courts, upheld the ordinance by a 4-3 vote in 1986. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday, did not take part in today's decision. The case is <PERSON> Pennell </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, 86-753

<HEAD>Government Urged To Apologize For 1980 Actions At Kwangju</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A civic panel recommending policy guidelines to the president called on the government to apologize for the military's bloody suppression of a civil uprising in the city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, members said today. The Committee for the <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconciliation </ORGANIZATION> also said the government should compensate victims of the 1980 revolt, said panel members. By official count, at least 191 people were killed and more than 800 were wounded in the nine-day uprising in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. Dissident sources say the casualty figure was much higher. President-elect <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> set up the 56-member committee after winning the Dec. 16 presidential elections, saying he needed `` policy guidelines'' reflecting the opinions of broad sections of the society. The committee called on the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government, to be inaugurated Thursday, to make an open apology for the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> incident and compensate its victims. The committee also urged <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to declare a human rights charter in a bid to show his determination to support civil rights. The committee said a government apology is needed because harsh military suppression was partly blamed for the anti-government uprising, the worst in modern Korean history. The <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> incident is a touchy political issue involving <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and his predecessor, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, who seized power with military backing in 1980. They are known to have played a key part in the military suppression of the uprising. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has also been criticized for its alleged part in the military suppression of the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising. Government critics have alleged that the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commander in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> permitted some South Korean army units under his operational control to help crush the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> revolt. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has denied the allegations.

 The theft of a transcript of grand jury testimony wo n't compromise the investigation of the alleged rape and kidnapping of a black teen-ager, state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said Tuesday that a former employee of <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' office had been arrested and charged with stealing and disclosing a transcript of testimony taken before the <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury investigating the attack on <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> was appointed by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> as a special prosecutor to investigate the case. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, 16, was found on Nov. 28 in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> after having disappeared for four days. She was wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and covered with feces, with `` KKK'' and `` nigger'' scrawled on her body. On the advice of her attorneys, she has not cooperated with investigators since shortly after the attack. The Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, one of Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s representatives, said the alleged theft of the grand jury transcript `` underscores the ineptness and incompetence that we've been talking about.'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said he spoke for attorneys <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who are advising the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the arrest will not affect the investigation, which continues Monday when a special state grand jury is to be empaneled in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 49, was employed as the senior printing machine operator in <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' office until his resignation on Feb. 5. He allegedly stole the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> transcript before he left the job. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, surrendered to the district attorney's office on Tuesday According to <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> gave the transcript to an unidentified person on Feb. 18.

 A triumphant <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> headed for Southern campaign territory today with two <LOCATION> Republican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> victories in hand, proclaiming `` it's a lot more fun winning.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed his losses, saying `` You ca n't win them all.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> racked up solid victories in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s presidential caucuses and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s primary while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> finished third in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and last in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his poor showings were `` somewhat anticipated.'' `` You ca n't go everywhere,'' he told reporters. `` ... You ca n't win them all. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, with dismal finishes in both states, took solace in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s equally poor showings. `` I think last night proved the race is wide open. That's all I really needed,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` I needed to break up the idea that this is a Bush-Dole race.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was campaigning today in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which holds its primary March 5, three days before the 20-state Super Tuesday contest. A week ago, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> lost the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. A week before that, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lost the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, finishing behind former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who ran second to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, said he was `` simply delighted'' with his showing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. But he conceded he had hoped for a victory in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, where he built a strong organization. `` This helps me enormously as I go into the Super Tuesday states,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said today in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` I am very pleased with what I'm seeing. I believe that coming out of Super Tuesday I will be the acknowledged front-runner of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with delegates.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had bypassed campaigning in the two states, went to bed in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> without commenting to reporters on the returns. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, for his part, was anything but silent. `` I hope we send a message that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has a message,'' the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator told cheering backers at a victory celebration in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` That's what the election is all about. I have n't changed my message I'm talking about the future, I've talked about leadership, I've talked about party responsibility, I've talked about the left-outs, the down-and-outs in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Returns from all but one precinct in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 55 percent, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 20 percent, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 19 percent and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> 5 percent. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, with returns in from 80 percent of the precincts, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had 42 percent, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 28 percent, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> 15 and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 11. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was in a do-or-die effort to make a competitive showing in one of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> states. On the last weekend of the campaign, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> inundated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> with biographical television commercials that emphasized family values and he spent most of the weekend campaigning in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. But he spent the election night in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, unavailable to reporters. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the first order of business in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses was a non-binding straw poll of presidential preference. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> startled party regulars in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses with a strong second-place finish, well ahead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The former evangelist saw <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> as a similar situation and he hoped to repeat his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> performance. <PERSON> Barb </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykora </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, had predicted a lot of people would attend caucuses for the first time. `` I think there are going to be a lot of people coming for <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and for <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>,'' she said. `` Where is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>?'' taunted <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> during campaign appearances in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. `` Why vote for someone who does n't come to the state?'' the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator asked an audience in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, on the final full day of campaigning. As usual, party officials were unable to project the turnout for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> because so many of his supporters were newcomers to Republican politics. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s best showing so far in the race going into Tuesday's contests was third place in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, well behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman hoped a strong showing in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> would give his campaign renewed energy. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was staging a bus tour in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> today.

 A coroner has reclassified as homicide the death of an elderly woman whose head was surgically removed and frozen in hopes that she could some day be brought back to life with a new body. `` We're saying this was an 83-year-old lady that was ill and pushed over the edge by the use of a drug,'' Supervising Deputy Coroner <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cupido </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s death last December at the <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> has been under investigation since January. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinman </PERSON> said he is `` fairly confident charges will be filed,'' but he did not say who would be charged, when, or specify the charges. The woman's original death certificate indicated she died from pneumonia in the absence of a doctor, which prompted the coroner's office to investigate whether she was alive when the procedure to remove her head was started Authorities seeking to force <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> to produce the frozen head have been blocked by an injunction. The coroner's office ruled after an autopsy was performed on the woman's headless body, basing its findings on the opinions of toxicologists and a pathologist contracted by <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cupido </PERSON> said. The woman's son, <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, and other advocates of cryonics believe in storing bodies or heads at freezing temperatures in hopes of someday bringing them back to life through advances in science. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said today that the allegations of homicide were `` smear tactics'' to discredit <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION>. He said the foundation has explained thoroughly the use of drugs in its notes regarding his mother's preservation `` Now suddenly to come up and say that they think it's homicide is kind of absurd,'' he said. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, who was at the laboratory when his mother's head was removed, said barbiturates were administered after death to slow brain damage from lack of oxygen. Tests showed levels of pentobarbital and secobarbital throughout the woman's system, indicating she was alive when she was given the drugs. The amendment to the death certificate filed Tuesday says Mrs. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> died between Dec. 9 and Dec. 11, and lists the immediate cause of death as pneumonia and generalized severe arteriosclerosis. The drugs expedited the death, <PERSON> Cupido </PERSON> said. `` A patient with that -LRB- the illnesses listed on the death certificate -RRB- given barbiturates will go over the edge,'' he said. `` It's like you have a gunshot victim who develops pneumonia in the hospital and dies,'' he said. `` It does n't mean he was n't shot. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Federowicz </PERSON>, who was president of <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> at the time and was present during the operation, said finding barbiturates in Mrs. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s system does not prove she was alive when the drugs were administered.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today broadened protection for criminal defendants who claim they were enticed by law enforcement officials into committing a crime. By a 6-2 vote, the justices overturned a bribery conviction against <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, a former Small Business Administraton official. The court said a criminal defendant should be allowed to introduce the defense of entrapment at the trial even if he inconsistently denies committing a criminal act. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> was sentenced to probation for three years for accepting a $ 2,100 loan from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShazer </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knitting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> was in charge of a program that provides help to businesses owned by `` socially and economically disadvantaged'' firms. <PERSON> DeShazer </PERSON>, acting as an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant, gave <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> the money at a hotel coffee shop on April 23, 1985, and <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> was arrested as he left the restaurant. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> said he needed the money because he had just been told he was being fired by the <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> and was financially strapped. He said he regarded the money as a personal favor from <PERSON> DeShazer </PERSON> and denied the loan was a bribe to get him to help <PERSON> DeShazer </PERSON> receive advance payments from the government on a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contract for <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knitting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION>. A federal judge refused to allow <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> to present evidence to the jury to support his claim of entrapment unless he also admitted that he intended to commit a crime. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today said <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> should be allowed to claim entrapment while denying he took the money with criminal intent. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, in his opinion for the court, noted that an entrapment defense is based on a defendant's claim that he was induced into comitting the crime and lacked a predisposition to engage in criminal conduct The government argued that a jury can not logically conclude that a defendant both failed to commit the elements of the alleged offense and was entrapped. But <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said defendants are allowed to be inconsistent. He rejected the government's claim that allowing inconsistent defenses will encourage perjury, confuse jurors and subvert the truth-finding purpose of a trial. `` We are simply not persuaded by the government's arguments that we should make the availability of an instruction on entrapment where the evidence justifies it subject to a requirement of consistency to which no other such defense is subject,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, in a separate concurring opinion, said he voted with the majority, but only because he believes `` when genuine inconsistency exists its effect in destroying the defendant's credibility will suffice to protect the interests of justice.'' Dissenting were Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court last Thursday, did not take part in the decision. The case is <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 86-6109.

 Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> today backed down on his threat to halt all state government checks because of a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision invalidating the budget. `` It's nothing more than hot air and a whimper of the wind,'' <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> said of Tuesday's 3-2 ruling by the court, which said the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> had appropriated $ 26 million more than Gov. Arch <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said would be available. The state Constitution requires a balanced budget. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> released a number of checks for hospital workers today, less than 24 hours after threatening to halt the processing of all state bills. He said the decision allows for a 60-day grace period, and for a petition for a rehearing, meaning the case wo n't be resolved until after the June 30 end of the fiscal year by the time the court issues a final ruling. He called the court decision a `` token action to appease the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>,'' and labeled it a `` charade.'' Legislative leaders say they will ask the court for a rehearing with the 60-day grace period. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has already scheduled a special session of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> for April 12 to look at education matters, and the budget question presumably could be considered at that time. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a Republican, had called the treasurer's threat to stop payments ridiculous. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, a Democrat, had countered Tuesday by calling the governor's criticism `` rubbish.'' The governor was in <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> today and could not be reached immediately for comment on <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s decision to release paychecks. However, press secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had a possible safety valve: a bill he received Tuesday would allow him to borrow up to $ 50 million from the state consolidated investment fund of pension and workers' compensation money. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is bickering with the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, however, over a provision that requires him to pay the money back by Sept. 30, Price said. Amid the bitter verbal battle, all sides agreed that the state was lurching toward a crisis Monday, when a bimonthly payroll of $ 15 million is due to go out to 40,000 state employees. `` As of this moment, all of the checks are stopped,'' <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, one of three state officials who must sign all checks, had said Tuesday. The high court's ruling, written by Justice <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON>, did not tell <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> what to do, saying simply, `` We presume the governor and <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> will do their duties.'' Senate President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON>, a Democrat, said the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> will petition the high court for a rehearing. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who was named as a defendant in the court case, never contested that the budget was unconstitutionally out of balance. The state is suffering from slumping tax collections, with revenue $ 35.7 million behind projections as of the end of January. The New York-based investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 15 issued a national warning covering $ 900 million of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s bonds, saying that neither the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> nor the executive branch was addressing the state's `` deteriorating financial picture.'' The financial officer at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which employs more than 8,000 state workers, criticized the court's overturning of the state budget. `` I do n't know how you can just shut down the whole world,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Signorelli </PERSON>, associate vice president for finances at the <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION> campus. Others supported the ruling, including officials of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which last year filed the lawsuit leading to the decision. The suit challenged $ 13.5 million in cuts for education funding. `` I think it's great. The financing of education is, among mandated public services, the first constitutional priority,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruth </PERSON>, executive secretary of the 18,500-member association. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> parliamentarian <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said it was the first time he knew of that the state's budget was thrown out as unconstitutional by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 Lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speaks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have filed notice they plan to appeal a federal judge's decision upholding the $ 6.6 million claim of an heiress who charged she had been duped into donating money. The notice, filed Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, said the fundamentalist church plans to ask a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to overturn <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>'s decision in the case. In January, <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> upheld a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy judge's ruling supporting a $ 6.6 million claim against the church by heiress <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION>, maintained that she was duped into donating the money by church founder and president <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. Meanwhile, a trustee appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday he hoped to receive additional bids for the church's <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> headquarters before a Feb. 28 deadline. Trustee <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrari </PERSON> said the only bid he has gotten for the 65-acre campus with 28 buildings has been a $ 2.5 million offer from <ORGANIZATION> Woodland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION>, a Pittsfield-based real estate company. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, an executive with <ORGANIZATION> Woodland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION>, has declined to discuss his plans for the property. The campus closed a few weeks after Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> prevailed in Bankruptcy Court. She was the high bidder at a November auction of the church headquarters, but the <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected her $ 1.8 million bid as too low. The campus has been appraised at $ 6 million. Her claim is the largest of the hundreds of creditors, who claim they are owed a total of $ 7 million by the church.

 House Democrats scrambled today to assemble majority support for Thursday's vote on a $ 30 million `` humanitarian'' aid package for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, including roughly equal amounts for the Contra rebels and for children who are victims of the country's seven-year civil war. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, called it `` the most workable kind of program'' and one that will provide `` balanced incentives'' for the Contras and the leftist Sandinista government to pursue peace talks called for in a regional accord. The package was unveiled late Tuesday by Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., after two weeks of intensive negotiations among several factions of the chamber's majority party It went before the Rules Committee today, where Republicans were expected to demand the right to offer their own alternative. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not immediately react to the Democrats' package His own $ 36.2 million aid proposal for the rebels, including weapons, was narrowly rejected by the House three weeks ago. Among major elements in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal: _ About $ 3.6 million a month for the Contras: half to buy food, clothing, medicine and shelter, and the other half to pay for delivery of the supplies to rebel troops inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> The aid would run from March 1, after current aid expires, until June 30. It could continue until the end of the year if a cease-fire is reached by June 30. _ About $ 1.4 million for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Miskito Indians, an opposition group that has been carrying out its own battle against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, but has consistently refused invitations to join with the Contras The Indians already have worked out their own cease-fire with the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> regime. _ A new $ 14 million `` Children's Survival Fund,'' to provide medical help for children on all sides of the conflict The aid would be administered by `` non-political'' private aid groups or international relief agencies already working in the region. Not included in the package was any long-term economic development aid for the region, but a Democratic fact sheet said `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will welcome proposals'' from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on that subject. Current aid to the rebels expires Feb. 29, and with it the legal authority for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to continue air drops of previously stockpiled weapons and ammunition. The new package contains no such authority. Under the new proposal, the Contras' `` humanitarian'' supplies would be delivered by private contractors supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> until the Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are able to agree on a cease-fire. The deliveries would be monitored by the congressional intelligence committees and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm, to ensure that no weapons were included. After fighting stops, responsibility for delivery would shift to a private aid group or an international relief agency such as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The package also would provide for an expedited procedure for a vote on new military aid for the rebels _ a high priority for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration _ if a cease-fire should fall apart and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> should fail to keep their promises to democratize. The determination of whether expedited procedures should be initiated would be made by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION>, according to a fact sheet on the package. But Republicans were skeptical of the provision, saying it was not a solid guarantee that military aid would come to a quick vote in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he was `` not necessarily'' confident of the votes to pass the package. Republicans have remained aloof from the drafting process, holding out for more aid and for continued authority for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to deliver previously stockpiled weapons. `` The key to this really will be how much support it gets on the Republican side,'' said <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, a longtime Contra aid opponent who added that he planned to vote against the package. Other Democrats said they expected at least 70 in their party to oppose the proposal. `` The party is seeking a middle ground on an issue that is not compromisable,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION> `` It appears to me to be an exercise in attempting to cover ourselves'' and avoid political blame if the Contras go out of business and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> renege on promises to increase civil liberties. Democrats have argued against new military aid, saying that providing it would endanger peace efforts. Talks between the Contras and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> broke off over the weekend without progress, and no date has been set for their resumption. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and many congressional Republicans have countered that it is only consistent military pressure from rebel attacks that has forced the Sandinistas into peace talks.

 A 16-month-old girl bitten by a horde of ants was in critical condition today in the children's intensive care unit of <ORGANIZATION> Sacred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheatam </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION>, a small <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community about 20 miles east of this <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> city, had stopped breathing when rescuers arrived at her home shortly after noon Tuesday, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON>, an emergency medical technician for the Holley-Navarre Volunteer Fire Department. `` There were ants crawling all over the child,'' <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Papadelias </PERSON>, a Sacred Heart spokeswoman, said she suspected the attack was by fire ants, known for their vicious sting, but she was unable to confirm that with doctors, who were busy treating the child.

 <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was followed to a `` crummy'' motel by men who let air out of his tires and photographed him as he tried to put a spare tire on backwards, visited a reputed prostitute and was confronted by a rival evangelist, a church leader said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, a member of the general council of the Assemblies of God, the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, described the pictures in an interview with WBRZ-TV here Tuesday. He also said he expects the council to strengthen the punishment <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> receives from executives of his 2 million-member denomination after admitting `` moral failures.'' The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district council has recommended a three-month suspension and counseling for the TV evangelist, whose ministry reaches more than 100 countries and reported $ 142 million in income last year. `` The constitution and bylaws require at least a year's cessation of active ministry,'' <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> said The executive presbytery of the Assemblies of God will make the final decision in the <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> case. Rev. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenhouse </PERSON>, Assemblies of God general secretary, said the group was tentatively scheduled to meet Thursday. Church spokeswoman <PERSON> Juleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said an extra telephone operator had to be hired at church headquarters in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, to handle some of the hundreds of calls about the case. She said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had as many supporters as detractors among the callers. <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> described the photographs that led <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> to make a tearful confession of sin Sunday, and disclosed that the Rev. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> was directly involved in the picture-taking. Last year, <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> sued <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> for $ 90 million charging him with unjustly accusing <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> of repeatedly committing adultery. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> admitted a single `` immoral act'' with a woman. The pictures, which <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported last week were given to denomination leaders by <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, `` showed a motel _ a crummy little thing built in an L-shape _ they showed the number of this particular room and a woman accused of being a prostitute admitting several different men into the room, and eventually <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> going into the room and later coming out of the room,'' <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> said. `` And she came out a few moments behind him, and -LRB- <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> -RRB- had a flat tire on his car. These men who made the pictures had the let air out of his tires. `` When he went into the room, they called Rev. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> and he came down and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was changing his tire, and there's pictures of he and <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> talking to one another, just pictures, no sound,'' <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> struggled with the tire and `` he put the wheel on backwards,'' <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> could n't be reached for comment; church officials would n't say where he was. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> confirmed that he employed a private investigator, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, in connection with the lawsuit against <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and another investigator visited a strip of cheap motels on Airline Highway between <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to ask questions about <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, a motel resident said. The woman, who identified herself as <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrier </PERSON>, 39, was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Picayune </ORGANIZATION> as saying <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> on several occasions visited two Airline Highway motels, where he would park his <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> Car in the rear. Syndicated columnist <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who specializes in fundamentalist religions, said reports that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> sought pornographic acts rather than sexual intercourse probably led the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> council to conclude that he had not technically committed adultery, which would have resulted in a harsher punishment. One of the state council members involved in recommending rehabilitation for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said the presbyters regard his ministry as a gift from God. `` We had to look beyond the man to the ministry God has given him,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON> of Violet. `` Our objective was not only to rehabilitate a man but to save a unique ministry that feeds thousands of children a day, supports a multitude of missionaries and helps improve countless lives with the Gospel of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that it will not carry any programs from the <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> ministry in which he personally appears so long as <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> is suspended by his denomination. `` We have arrived at an arrangement whereby the <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> ministries will provide alternative programming,'' said <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Court Bolsters Right of Default-Judgment Losers in Texas Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Businessman's Name Listed in Court Papers as R. ``Roy''
Peralta</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today bolstered the right default-judgment losers have to challenge a judgment entered after they fail to respond to a lawsuit. The justices unanimously ruled for <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> in his challenge of a default judgment awarded against him six years ago for a $ 5,000 debt owed to a medical center. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> courts had ruled that such challenges are impermissible unless the judgment loser had a `` meritorious defense'' to the lawsuit. But writing for the high court, Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> rulings do not sufficiently protect the due-process rights of people who contend they were never notified about the lawsuits that resulted in the default judgments against them. For example, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> could have worked out a settlement or paid the debt or himself sold the property that was seized to satisfy the debt. <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> owned and operated a commercial diving business in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> when, in 1981, he guaranteed a $ 5,000 debt incurred by one of his employees to the <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The employee failed to make good on the debt, and the center sought to collect the debt by suing <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> in early 1982. <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> contends he was never notified about the lawsuit. A default judgment against him was issued in July 1982 _ and property his lawyers say was valued at more than $ 180,000 was auctioned off to satisfy the $ 5,000 debt. When <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> challenged the default judgment and subsequent sales of his property, his appeal was dismissed because he could not prove a meritorious defense to the underlying debt lawsuit _ a requirement under <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law. In ruling for <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON>, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, `` Where a person has been deprived of property in a manner contrary to the most basic tenets of due process, it is no answer to say that in his particular case due process of law would have led to the same result.'' He added: `` Only wiping the slate clean would have restored -LRB- <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> -RRB- to the position he would have occupied had due process of law been accorded to him in the first place.'' The court's vote was 8-0. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court Thursday, did not participate in the decision. The case is <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 86-1430.

<HEAD>Court Rules Judges Lack Authority to Order Fees Paid in Arkansas

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ruled that federal judges lack authority to order the government to pay fees to lawyers who successfully obtain overdue federal welfare for poor people who are aged, blind or disabled. The 8-0 ruling in a case from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> held that federal officials are not required by law to withhold a portion of a recipient's benefits to pay the attorney. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, writing for the court, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made it clear that attorney's fees were not to be paid in such cases where past-due benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program -LRB- SSI -RRB- are awarded to recipients. The decision, a victory for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, reversed a ruling by the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in a case involving benefits for <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbreath </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Galbreath </PERSON> applied for benefits on May 26, 1982, but the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> denied her request. She hired a lawyer, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jonesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, and he won a federal court suit on Feb. 15, 1985, awarding her $ 7,954 in past-due benefits. <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON> then asked the federal judge to award him $ 1,988 _ or 25 percent of the amount paid Ms. <PERSON> Galbreath </PERSON> _ for representing her. The judge ordered the government to pay the attorney and the 8th Circuit court agreed. The appeals court said requiring payment to lawyers in such cases assures recipients will have adequate legal representation. Health and Human Services officials said to comply with the ruling it would be necessary to recover the $ 1,988 from Ms. <PERSON> Galbreath </PERSON>. The department also said it would create administrative headaches for the agency since in 1985 alone there were some 8,000 cases involving disputed claims for SSI benefits. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court last Thursday, did not take part in the decision. The case is <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Galbreath </PERSON>, 86-1146.

 Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said today that his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> knew the whereabouts of the American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and he suggested that they could have been rescued. `` We identified in our news department at <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> the location of those hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> very shortly after they were taken, and they were in a position where they could have been rescued,'' the former television evangelist said during a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` They were in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and they could have been freed,'' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> did not provide any more specifics and did not say which hostages were involved. Nine Americans remain in captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who was heading the 75-man observer group attached to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> when he was captured last week. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held captive. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was kidnapped on March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, asked if he had informed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials about the <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> information, said: `` I broadcast it on national television. They monitor our programs virtually every day. Their speechwriters used to watch us to get some concepts for speeches.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> terrorism expert said he was puzzled by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s statements. The official, who requested anonymity, said he was unaware that <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> ever broadcast the precise locations of any hostages. He also said it was unclear from <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s statements which hostages he was referring to, since Americans have been taken captive at various times over the past several years. Knowledge of the hostages' whereabouts in terms of a particular city or even a section of a city would n't be enough to mount a rescue mission, the official said. In his statements, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> urged the administration to take more effective action against terrorists. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reaction `` must be more like the Israelis at <LOCATION> Entebbe </LOCATION>. It has to be quick, and it has to be a surprise,'' he said. Last July, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he ran into Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a key figure in the Iran-Contra affair, on Sept. 13, 1985, at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The then-White House aide said he was en route to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to negotiate the release of the hostages, according to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Six days later, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he interviewed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION>, saying to the president, `` I understand that a member of your official family has gone to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to negotiate the release of the hostages.'' During a Republican presidential debate on Feb. 14, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s allegation that the Soviets have nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> touched off a controversy, bringing administration denials <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said during the debate, `` Some information came to me that the Soviets, in violation of the so-called Khrushchev-Kennedy accords, have put some SS-4s and SS-5s in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. ... It seems like, to me, nukes pointing at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are more vital to our security than nukes pointing to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he based his claim on testimony by Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee. The day after the debate, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said SS-4 and SS-5 missile sites established in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1962 `` were confirmed as having been destroyed in that year.

It should have been <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, referring to his decision to retire 16 aging frigates, said the creation of a 600-ship navy was not abandoned, only delayed until the in the 1990s. `` Tough choices had to be made to accommodate this reduction in the short time available,'' said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, referring to an agreement between President eagan and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reduce defense spending by $ 33 billion in two months. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> named <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a soft-spoken Southerner with a reputation as a savvy, behind-the-scenes negotiator to replace the pugnacious, controversial <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> intends to stand by his 600-ship goal, even though he wo n't be in office to see it realized. It also offered words of encouragement for <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and the new nominee. `` We look to Will Ball to continue working aggressively for a strong <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Budget constraints have delayed a 600-vessel <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, but it should still be realized in fiscal year 1992 or thereabouts, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The budget restructuring under way at the Pentagon now is a difficult and painful process,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is doing an admirable job. He's quite capable and suitable to the task, and he's carrying out the president's policies in that regard.'' Of Ball, he said, `` All of us who know him here at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> know that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is getting a strong advocate and a strong fighter.'' Ball is expected to have little difficulty winning <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, since the nomination will be reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where he once was an aide. The 39-year-old has been the president's chief congressional lobbyist since February 1986. Before that, he served as the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief liaison with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. From 1981 to 1985 he was administrative assistant to then Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, serving also as chief clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1981. He also worked as administrative assistant to former Sen. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>, D-Ga., in 1978 The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native is a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and was a regular officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> from 1969 to 1975. As secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> will oversee approximately 584,000 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel and 199,000 Marines. Several <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday that <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was an unknown who would confront a `` show-me'' attitude within the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've had two very exceptional secretaries of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the last seven years,'' said one official who asked not to be named. `` And you just do n't find that caliber of individual on every street corner. So there is anxiety.'' Another official said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s sudden departure on Monday had hurt morale within the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, `` but hopefully that's only temporary.'' `` The thing is, we're used now to having an aggressive secretary who really fights for us inside and outside the building. And that's what we want to see in Ball,'' he added.

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials today named an Armenian as leader of a disputed region of the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> after major protests in the Armenian capital that one source said drew up to 200,000 people. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency announced late today that <PERSON> Genrikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Pogosyan </PERSON>, 56, was named by the regional party committee to replace <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kevorkov </PERSON> as head of Nagorno-Karabakhskaya. A later <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch said Armenian party leaders had agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the region should remain under jurisdiction of the region of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>, rather than being annexed by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Armenian leaders had gathered to consider `` urgent measures to normalize the situation'' in the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, but it gave no details of the unrest. A former political prisoner said earlier that soldiers brought tanks into <PERSON> Nagorno-Karabakhskaya </PERSON> to put down protests there and that rumors had reached <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that some demonstrators were killed. <PERSON> Paruyr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, the former prisoner, said in a phone call from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that 200,000 demonstrators converged on the capital's central square today, demanding an extraordinary meeting of the Armenian parliament to resolve the dispute over control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakhskaya </LOCATION> `` There are at least 200,000 people in front of the opera house _ I've never seen anything like it,'' <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said. He said he was speaking from an apartment 100 yards from the protest. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> confirmed that the territory dispute had prompted a major street demonstration in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, 1,100 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He said the gathering was peaceful and that he not know the number of protesters. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> confirmed that four senior officials of the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> were sent to the disputed region to quell the protests. It was not immediately clear whether transfer of power to an Armenian would end the dispute, but the naming of <PERSON> Pogosyan </PERSON> appeared to be a concession by the party to the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> protesters' concerns. Today was the second day of unrest in the Armenian capital and included widespread strikes and school boycotts, <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakhskaya </LOCATION> is 1,760 square miles in area, slightly smaller than <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. Most of its 150,000 people are Armenians. Outbreaks of ethnic tensions have occurred with increasing frequency over the past year as Soviets embrace party chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call for `` glasnost,'' or more openness in tackling the nation's social problems. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed concern over nationalist tendencies among the more than 100 peoples comprising the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and called for a special meeting to look into the problem. In a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch Tuesday, the government took the unusual step of acknowledging the unrest. The report, read on national television, said the demands of the demonstrators `` contradict the interests of the working people.'' The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday night acknowledged a `` mass meeting'' of protesters in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, student boycotts and the involvement of national party officials in trying to resolve the conflict. Today's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda carried the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report, but no commentary on the events. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said two members of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s Secretariat, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolgikh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Tuesday `` to calm the people. Today, <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dolgikh </PERSON> persuaded the demonstrators to send a small delegation to party headquarters in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to discuss the dispute, <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said. Attempts to reach the offices of <LOCATION> Sovietskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, the republic's main newspaper, for an official account of today's incident were unsuccessful, and calls to other <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> telephones also did not go through <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, 38, spent 17 years in labor camps and exile for heading an underground Armenian nationalist group in the 1960s. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissident <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nagorno-Karabakhskaya </PERSON>, in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, was deeded to <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> in the early 1920s. Earlier this month, the local government council asked that the region become part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, citing the Soviet Constitution's guarantee of the right of self-determination, <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said The party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected the request. <PERSON> Nagorno-Karabakhskaya </PERSON> was the scene of other mass demonstrations last fall when ethnic Armenians marched to protest what they claimed was mistreatment by Azeris, the dominant population of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>. Today was also the 70th anniversary of independent <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, a small republic on the Baltic coast that was incorporated into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> complained that Western political figures were encouraging unrest there, a sign demonstrations were expected.

<HEAD>Company Announces Condom To Be Worn By Women</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs describing device</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new contraceptive which resembles a condom but is worn by women will be tested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this spring, a pharmaceutical company announced today. The disposable device may be one of the most effective ways of reducing the risk of sexually transmitted disease, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON>, a researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacal </ORGANIZATION>, which hopes to market the device. The company, based in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said the device provides more protection than the male condom, in part because the material is stronger than most condoms and covers a larger physical area, reducing chances of infection or exposure to body fluids. The company hopes to submit an application to the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> this summer to permit sales of the device, Ms. <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> said at a news conference. There was no estimate on the retail price. The product has undergone clinical trials in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and several other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries, the company said. The condom was developed by an international group of gynecologists and obstetricians, headed by Danish gynecologist Dr. <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregerson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Bente </PERSON>. The condom consists of a soft, loose-fitting polyurethane sheath and two diaphragm-like, flexible polyurethane rings, Ms. <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> said. One of the rings lies inside the sheath and serves as insertion mechanism and internal anchor, much like a diaphragm. The other ring forms the outer edge of the sheath and remains outside the vagina.

 Republican presidential hopeful <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was riding high today after twin victories over <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> preludes to next month's Super Tuesday showdowns, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed off his losses. Democrats <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> swapped victories and said they were eager to carry their battle to the South. Meanwhile, Democrat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said today he would bypass the March 8 collection of 20 primaries and caucuses, citing a lack of money and the belief that Super Tuesday would result `` in a very mixed picture.'' `` The campaign will begin anew after Super Tuesday, starting in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>'' on March 15, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Republican <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, said the news staff at his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> once knew the whereabouts of hostages in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> _ proving, he said, they could have been rescued. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reaction to terrorism, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said, `` has to be quick, and it has to be a surprise. ... We identified in our news department at <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> the location of those hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> very shortly after they were taken, and they were in a position where they could have been rescued. They were in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and they could have been freed.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, asked if he had informed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said, `` I broadcast it on national television; they monitor our programs virtually every day.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed off his losses in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, saying today after arriving to campaign in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, `` You ca n't win them all.'' The vice president, who made virtually no effort in the two upper Midwestern states, said, `` I think the result was somewhat anticipated; you ca n't go everywhere.'' He added, `` We've done well out there. We've won in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>.'' Tuesday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said after splitting the two upper Midwestern contests with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, `` This is a marathon. It's going to be a long one.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor won in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> on Tuesday, and dealt <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> a crushing defeat. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was the winner in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a respectable second. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won both states going away _ with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> far, far behind. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the vice president finished fourth behind <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> winning all 18 of the delegates at stake, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was narrowly edged for second place by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. The former television evangelist said today in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, `` This helps me enormously as I go into the Super Tuesday states.'' He added, `` I believe that coming out of Super Tuesday I will be the acknowledged front-runner of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with delegates.'' Wasting no time before heading for the next battleground, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was flying to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> today for four quick campaign appearances. `` I hope it can help me in the South,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said of his latest victories. `` I've got a big hill to climb in the South.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was buried in the Tuesday night returns, running third in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and fourth in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. After his embarrassing defeat two weeks ago in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose to head South rather than take on <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> again in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. It was up one week and down the next in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race. After <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s strong <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> showing, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bounced back to win the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary a week ago. This was <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s week again, but now the scene shifts to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is regarded as the front-runner. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were quick to hail their <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> victories. `` This ... was a great victory that we have had in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>,'' said the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who finished second in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, said, `` I think it's very good news for us because we've finished strong in every one of these states.'' Also able to claim a measure of victory was Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was leading <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> for second place in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. One-time <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> also had a thumbs down for his lonely campaign to `` let the people decide.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> got 5 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and 1 percent in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Unable to get 10 percent of the vote in two consecutive primaries, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> stands to lose his eligibility for federal matching funds. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> described his third-place finish in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> as a `` pleasant surprise,'' though he worked hard in the state and got just 8 percent of the vote. In returns from all but one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s 1,151 precincts, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had 51,529 or 55 percent of the vote compared to 18,275 or just under 20 percent for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and 17,416 or 19 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> trailed with 5 percent. That meant <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> led for all of the state's 18 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> next summer. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was just short of qualifying for delegates with one precinct's votes uncounted. None of the other three contests was directly allocating delegates, although each of the winners was getting an edge in the process. With all but one of the Democratic precincts reporting in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had 31,226 or 44 percent and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 22,367 or 31 percent. The also rans were <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at 8 percent, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> at 6 percent and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 5 percent each. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, Republican results from 80 percent of the precincts gave <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 43 percent to 28 percent for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was third with 15 percent and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was running fourth with 11 percent. The Democratic caucus procedure in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> was complicated and returns were still trickling in well past midnight. With 74 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 34 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had just under 20 percent, with 19 percent uncommitted. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had 18 percent, while <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had 7 percent. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 1 percent each.

<HEAD>Reagan Will Oppose Congressional Notification Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> testified today that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would reject legislation tying his hands on covert activities, including any requirement that he tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of secret operations within 48 hours. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel he agreed with the lawmakers' goal of preventing another Iran-Contra affair by tightening control of covert operations, but said a presidentially approved national security directive would do the job. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has already lost round one in its battle to maintain greater discretion on when to notify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 13-2 for legislation that includes the 48-hour requirement, and is similar in other respects to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> is now trying to derail. `` A bill which fails to preserve the flexibility and authority the president needs to conduct intelligence activities effectively will not be acceptable to the president,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> warned, although he did not use the word `` veto.'' Members of both intelligence committees introduced the legislation after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> failed for 10 months to notify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of his February 1986 approval of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. And he did so only after a Lebanese publication exposed the U.S.-Iranian negotiations to free American hostages. A number of lawmakers said quick notification would have given them a chance to presuade <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that his policy was a mistake. The law now requires an administration to give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> prior notification of significant intelligence activities, but allows the president to delay that in extraordinary circumstances. The notification must then take place in a `` timely fashion,'' although the word `` timely'' is left vague. In fact, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said, there have been only three times when notification has taken more than two days: the Iran-Contra affair; the rescue of Americans from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> who were hidden by Canadian diplomats, and the failed military attempt to rescue American hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said many problems in the Iran-Contra affair resulted from `` officials failing to follow existing procedures and rules.'' He said the secret operations to sell arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and to the Nicaraguan Contras were run by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> officials who did not normally work with these procedures. `` Some allowance must be made for that rare case where a limited delay in congressional notification is critical to preserve the absolute security of an operation when, for example, lives are at stake,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. He added that the new presidential policy requires top administration officials to re-evaluate at least every 10 days a presidential decision to delay notification of a given finding.

<HEAD>China Says It'll Stamp Out Illiteracy in Five Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will launch a nationwide campaign to stamp out illiteracy in five years, it was announced Wednesday. The goal is to raise the level of literacy of those between 15 and 40 years old to 85 percent of the rural population and 90 percent of the urban population, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It did not say what the levels are now. The literacy rate in 1987 was 80 percent nationwide, or more than 200 million illiterates, according to earlier reports. The campaign is prompted by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s need to provide better-educated and better-trained workers to carry forward the nation's recent economic development, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said. Anyone reading fewer than 500 characters is considered illiterate. Literacy standards for peasants is 1,500 characters and for industrial workers and urban residents is 2,000 characters. This level of literacy allows them to read newspapers and simple articles, do basic accounts and write simple essays. In 1949, when the communists came into power, four out of five Chinese were illiterate. In some rural areas, entire villages were illiterate.

<HEAD>Lay Employees to Donate Part of Salaries to Pope</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A union representing <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> lay employees on Wednesday announced a unique way to call attention to their salary complaints: donating part of their pay to Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> to help feed the poor. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 1,500 employees, said workers next Monday would stage an `` active strike'' for three hours at the start of each shift to protest plans to change their pay schedule. The workers will do their jobs but will donate their first three hours' pay `` directly to the Holy Father as our contribution toward his work and in favor of those suffering from hunger in the world,'' a union statement said. `` This is clearly a new type of protest,'' said union president <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerullo </PERSON>. `` We felt we had to send a clear message, and the best way was to send it directly to the pope.'' For years the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> employees have complained about their salaries, which <PERSON> Cerullo </PERSON> said range from $ 927 to $ 1,370 a month. They are exempt from Italian taxes, work a 36-hour week and have one month of vacation and 26 paid holidays. The labor action was called to protest the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s plan to pay workers at the end of each month, like most employees in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Until now, most Vitan workers have been getting their paychecks on the first day of the month. The union said the change will cause hardship to the families of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> employees. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials have said the change is primarily to facilitate administrative matters. The change also would affect about 1,000 religious employees of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The lay employees work at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> museums, post office, main library, the daily newspaper <PERSON> L'Osservatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> and many offices.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> said today he would not challenge his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals _ including Tuesday's winners <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> _ in the March 8 Super Tuesday contests but would rejoin the battle the next week His announcement came one day after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> each notched their second victories of the campaign _ in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> respectively _ with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> well back in both states. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, won the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary last week, and Rep. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> was the victor in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> the week before. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told reporters he would bypass the primaries and caucuses being held in 20 states on Super Tuesday because he did n't `` have the resources for winning'' there. But he promised to continue his campaign in his home state and in the primaries that follow. `` The campaign will begin anew after Super Tuesday, starting in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. He spoke of `` growing evidence that for the first time in recent history there will be no first-ballot winner at the Democratic convention.'' And he said the primaries and caucuses on March 8 will not clear up the confusion. `` Super Tuesday is likely to result in a very mixed picture,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, meanwhile, were settling in for a lengthy slugout. `` This is a marathon,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It's going to be a long one.'' Each had something to crow about. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman pointed to his `` great victory,'' while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gleefully noted that <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> is a `` long way from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>'' _ trumpeting the fact that he has shown vote-getting power outside his home turf. `` We did well in these two states which are a long way from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and very much in the backyard of some of the rest of these candidates,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, referring to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator. `` Remember, I'm somebody that nobody knew in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was exultant. `` It's a great victory in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Tonight is a Gephardt night.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> targeted both <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> early, but <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> staged a last-minute campaign blitz in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> in an effort to head off a <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> sweep by his rival. With all but one precinct counted in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had 44 percent, followed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at 31 percent. Trailing were <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> at 8 percent, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> at 6 percent, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 5 percent and 10 votes apart. With 74 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 34 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 20 percent, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 18 percent, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 7 percent, and uncommitted 19 percent. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 1 percent and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> trailed with just 179 votes. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> had virtually ignored <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> tried to look past his dismal showings in the two states. `` We did n't focus on it,'' he said from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. `` I made it clear from the beginning of the campaign, we're focusing on the national primary March 8, when over 1,000 delegates will be selected.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said his <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> showing indicated `` we are attractive to voters in every region.'' With the scene shifting southward, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was considered well positioned for Super Tuesday, March 8, when 20 states, mostly in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, will hold primaries and caucuses. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the best-organized <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and spent the most money. His supporters recognized that anything less than a victory in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> would jolt his effort to prove he could win outside the Northeast. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> ran ads in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> asserting that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> knew nothing of agriculture, recalling <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' suggestion in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> a year ago that frmers should turn to products such as Belgian endive and blueberries. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> countered with an ad saying that `` while <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has been publicly promising to fight for you, he's taking political action committee money from corporate insiders and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyists. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Democrats bucked the national party to hold their contests earlier than party rules allowed. Under a compromise worked out with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the vote in the Democratic primary was legally non-binding, although the results were to help determine the allocation of delegates. A March 12 statewide caucus will apportion delegates according to the primary results. Under the agreement with <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the presidential preference poll taken at the Democratic caucuses was to be kept secret by the party until 5 p.m. on March 8. But the state set up an independent reporting system to gather caucus results and make them public.

<TEXT>
 The government today banned all political activities of the country's largest anti-apartheid organization, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and 16 other groups in one of its harshest crackdowns on the opposition. It banned several front leaders individually from working for the organization, writing articles, giving speeches or granting interviews. It also ordered that the main black labor federation, the militant <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, limit its activities only to labor issues and stay out of politics. `` The government has declared war against all peaceful opposition,'' said <PERSON> Azhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cachalia </PERSON>, treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and one of its few leaders not in detention. The front represents more than 600 anti-apartheid organizations with more than 2 million members. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against apartheid, also said many South Africans would see the restrictions as a `` declaration of war.'' `` The government's idea of reform is to smash all effective possible political opposition in the country, no matter how peaceful and lawful, and to rule with a jackboot,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. He appealed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western countries to intensify economic pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The restrictions, announced in a special government gazette, do not technically outlaw the front and the other groups, but effectively ban them by prohibiting them from carrying on any activities not approved by Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>. The crackdown affects virtually all of the largest militant black political groups in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and appears aimed at eliminating competition for black moderates willing to accept the concept of white political control. The co-president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumede </PERSON>, was taken away by police from his office in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, served with individual banning orders and released, colleagues said. <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, the other co-president, was barred from leaving her home between 6 p.m. and 5 a.m. and also was affected by the new orders. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, said it was `` appalled'' by the ban. `` By acting to outlaw the non-violent political activity of these organizations, the South African government dealt a severe blow to efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s problem. It is a giant step backward for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said the statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the staunchest opponent of sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, condemned the crackdown. Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said the `` oppressive'' restrictions could breed more violence. The Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, a co-founder of the front, said the government had acted out of frustration because its tough tactics during a 20-month-old state of emergency had failed to quell militant opposition. `` It is not possible, really, to ban the <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` The <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> is much less an organization than a symbol of the determination of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oppressed people to be free.'' He said one of the government's aims was to crush organizations that planned to call for a boycott of black municipal elections scheduled for October. If the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> was unable to promote a boycott, he said, he would do so personally. Under the restrictions, the organizations will be permitted to maintain bank accounts, perform administrative functions, and undertake legal action. But no other activities will be permitted unless authorized by <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>. Several of the affected groups said they would challenge the new orders in court. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, who signed the order, said the regulations `` will contribute to a climate of stability, peaceful coexistence and good neighborliness among all population groups.'' He said the groups affected by the regulations encouraged civil disobedience and rebellion, advocated alternatives structures to replace official ones, and waged campaigns of intimidation. Anti-apartheid activists had anticipated some type of crackdown this year, suggesting that President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government would move to blunt criticism from extreme-right white opponents. The order comes exactly a week before two parliamentary by-elections in which candidates from the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are favored to beat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidates. The Conservatives oppose even the limited racial reforms implemented by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> over the past few years. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, groups affected by the ban include: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Azanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the largest group espousing the black consciousness philosophy pioneered by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>, an activist who died in police custody in 1977 _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has sought to promote `` people's education'' in which black communities would exercise greater control over their schools _ The <ORGANIZATION> Detainees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors detentions and provides support for relatives of people detained without charge _ The Soweto Civic Assoiciation, the main anti-apartheid community group in the country's largest black township and a key factor behind the rent boycott which has persisted there for nearly two years Other affected groups include local and regional youth and community organizations and the <ORGANIZATION> Release </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group which campaigns for the release of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The black trade union congress, known as <ORGANIZATION> COSATU </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s order `` has turned the clock back to the days of absolute control and no democracy. `` The order demonstrates that the government is completely incompetent,'' said <ORGANIZATION> COSATU </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Meintjies </PERSON>. `` The end result is going to be conflict, fear and uncertainty.'' The country's 5 million whites control the government and economy and maintain segregated living areas, schools and hospitals. The 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

 Republican senators reacted angrily today after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol police seized Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> and carried him to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor _ feet first _ to answer a quorum call during an all-night filibuster over campaign financing legislation. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said the parliamentary arrest of <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Sergeant-at-Arms <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Guigni </PERSON> and five plainclothes Capitol policemen was `` demeaning and pointless. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> was treated like a `` common criminal ... brought forcefully to the floor of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>. But several <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators actually ran away from police to avoid arrest, said Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>. `` Senators went off in a dead sprint. They should have been in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> in one of the Olympic events,'' he said. `` The spectacle of a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator running from the sergeant-at-arms in order to keep from being compelled to attend a session of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is an outrage.'' <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Witeck </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Republican re-injured a broken hand, which has been in a cast the last two weeks, when the police entered his office with a passkey. <PERSON> Witeck </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> went to a hospital early today to have X-rays taken but that no new breaks were found. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s arm was `` severely jostled and hurt'' by `` Banana Republic'' tactics. `` When a senator is locked in his own chamber, I question whether it is constitutionally sound to break into his office and force him out of his office and carry him to the floor,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s spokesman said the senator `` tried to hold the door closed with his shoulder, but they were able to push it open.'' `` I had to take him in,'' <PERSON> siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Guigni </PERSON>, a one-time <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> motorcycle and vice officer. `` I knew he was not going in under his own power.'' <PERSON> Guigni </PERSON> said <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> walked with the detectives to the Capitol, but made it clear he would not walk into the chamber. `` We picked him up in the elevator'' and carried him to his desk, <PERSON> Guigni </PERSON> said. The motion to arrest absent senators was made by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and was approved on a 45-3 roll call vote, with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> voting no. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said the actual warrants were signed by Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> officials said the arrest was the first since <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators <ORGANIZATION> Burnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maybank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lister </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> were compelled to come to the floor in 1942 <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, a leader of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opposition to a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign finance bill, was brought in by four officers under terms of an unusual motion approved through late Tuesday by the majority Democrats. The Democrats, who were forcing the Republicans to wage the filibuster in an effort to subdue the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opposition to the Democrats' proposed limits on campaign spending and contributions from political action committees, employed the rarely used procedure to require absent members to answer quorum bells or face arrest. Republicans had been taking turns holding the floor to prevent the Democrats from bringing the bill to a vote they can win. This upset the Democrats, who had been forced to stay close to the chamber, maintain a quorum and keep the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in session. When most Republicans stopped answering quorum calls, the Democrats resorted to ordering <PERSON> Guigni </PERSON> to scour the hallways and offices and arrest absent senators. He carried warrants for each of the 46 Republicans. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> was found in his Russell Building office, <PERSON> Guigni </PERSON> said. `` I had to shove in a door to get into his office,'' <PERSON> Guigni </PERSON> said. `` I think he hurt his finger. He was very courteous.'' <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> was not available for immediate comment. Some 13 hours after the filibuster began, the two sides called a truce of sorts. Republicans would continue to talk, but there would be no more quorum calls until 10 a.m., giving most members a chance to sleep. As dawn broke, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., wound up an hour of holding the floor, speaking against the bill in a steady, conversational tone `` I've immensely enjoyed this, particularly at this time of day. There's nothing I'd rather be doing,'' <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said as turned control of the floor over to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, R-R.I. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> spoke to an almost-empty chamber. Freshman Sen. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, sat at the podium, while Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., represented the Democratic side of the aisle Eight teen-aged pages sat quietly on the carpeted steps leading to the podium and a few detectives sat in the otherwise empty gallery. The `` full-fledged filibuster'' was formally proclaimed by Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday after Republicans had done for five days what they had done for 22 days last year _ prevent a vote on the Democrats' campaign spending <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> has the votes to pass the bill, which would set voluntary spending limits for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> general elections. But he is still about five votes short of the 60 he needs to shut off debate and force a roll call. Early today, Democrats filed a cloture petition, which probably will be considered on Friday. Republicans, who last year beat <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> on a record seven cloture votes, say the proposed system to curb escalating campaign spending would prevent them from gaining seats in heavily Democratic states. <PERSON> Dove </PERSON> said the filibuster is the chamber's first knock-down test of attrition since a nine-day battle in 1960 over civil rights legislation. Four senators from each camp have been negotiating since last week, trying to find a compromise. They say they have found some common ground on issues such as better disclosure of money going to political paries and forcing broadcasters to offer rock-bottom ad rates to candidates. But they report nothing but disagreement over limiting campaign spending, which has risen from $ 600,000 for the average <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race in 1976 to $ 3 million in 1986, with a big-state race often topping $ 10 million. The chief <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> negotiator, <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, said Republicans were willing to discuss a compromise on another Democratic demand: putting a ceiling on how much money a candidate can get from political action committees. The Democrats' bill would establish voluntary spending limits, ranging from $ 950,000 to $ 5.5 million, depending on a state's population A candidate observing the limit would get campaign funds from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> if the opponent exceeded the limit or an independent group spent large amounts of money against the candidate. The Republicans would have some limits on individual PAC contributions while strengthening campaign-finance disclosure requirements and opposing spending limits.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON> escaped a contempt of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> citation Wednesday by turning over documents demanded by a congressional panel, but he said he felt he had become a scapegoat in a turf fight between two congressmen. <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON> had been subpoenaed to appear before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on oversight and investigations because he had refused to turn over some internal <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> documents sought by the panel concerning unfair advertising practices by the airline industry. He told the panel that the subcommittee's insistence on obtaining internal advisory documents `` represents a very poor development in the exercise of this subcommittee's oversight reponsibilities over the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON> said that `` violation of the confidence between a commissioner and his or her personal attorney-advisers makes government less efficient.'' `` I tell the men and women that serve in my office that I want their wholly candid assessment and unvarnished recommendation about matters before me,'' <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON> said. Due to the subcommittee's insistence on access to internal documents, he said, `` This morning I have instructed my staff that from henceforth they should not commit their work to paper. He said that until Friday, the panel had not provided the legal justification for him to provide the documents and said he could not test the legality of the demand without being willing to stand criminal trial. `` To my knowledge this Kafka-esque mode of operations is unique in our system of justice,'' <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON> said. After his appearance, <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON> said he believed he had become caught in a `` turf fight'' between panel Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., and Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm the pawn,'' he said. `` They were looking for a scapegoat, and I'm the unfortunate person chosen for that.'' Subcommittee counsel <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McLain </PERSON> refused to comment on <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON>'s allegation. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s office referred all request for comment to <PERSON> McLain </PERSON>. At issue were internal documents concerning the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s views on whether unfair and deceptive advertising practices were occurring in the airline industry. A letter on the matter from the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorneys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> indicated that the agency had not studied the matter, but a press release on the report indicated that the agency believed there was no problem with the airline industry's practices. A reference to the press release comment, included in a story by The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, was read on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor last October and helped defeat an amendment by <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> that would have transferred responsibility for oversight for consumer protection regarding the airline industry from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> McLain </PERSON> said. The subcommittee began asking the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> for internal documents on the matter several days later. Two commissioners said they had no such documents, two others allowed subcommittee staff to read pertinent materials in their offices, but <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON> refused to provide access to such documents. After several letters back and forth between the subcommittee and <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON>, who was insisting on the legal justification for the demand, the panel on Feb. 4 subpoenaed <PERSON> Calvani </PERSON> to appear and bring the documents.

 Subway gunman <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> is looking for a new lawyer to handle his defense against civil suits seeking a total of $ 63 million for three of the four youths he shot, according to one of his attorneys. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> decided to break with <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelner </PERSON>, the attorney he had hired for the civil cases, because of `` differences of viewpoint,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Slotnick </PERSON> last year won acquittal for <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> on the most serious criminal charges stemming from the shooting. Published reports quoted <PERSON> Kelner </PERSON> as saying he was withdrawing from the case because <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was not cooperating. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was convicted of weapon possession but acquitted of attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment in the Dec. 22, 1984, subway shooting of four young men. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who is white, said he feared the black youths were going to rob him. Two of the youths brought civil actions for $ 5 million and $ 8.5 million, while lawyers for <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabey </PERSON>, brain-damaged and paralyzed by the shooting, seek $ 50 million. <PERSON> Cabey </PERSON>'s lawyers say the shooting was racist and `` wrongful retaliation for past injury'' <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> had suffered at the hands of others.

Some of his parishioners went beyond mere charity. They praised <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> for his admission. -LRB- `` It took a man to do that.'' -RRB- The reaction of the public is likely to be less tolerant. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s confession reportedly came only after he was confronted with photographs showing him entering a motel room with a prostitute. The so-called `` Pearly Gate'' scandals vary in some ways, but there seems to be one common rule: If you get caught, confess and ask forgiveness _ but only if you get caught.

 Feb. 18 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Record </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, on filing tax returns early: The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is worried by a trend among many taxpayers to delay filing their federal tax returns. According to <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, five years ago 14 percent of all individual returns were filed in January and 34 percent in April. Last year, only 4 percent were filed in January and almost 40 percent in April. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that the trend, if exacerbated by the 1986 tax reform law, could pose big problems for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. That's because the government is obligated to pay interest on refunds whenever returns are not processed within a 45-day period after April 15. He's unlikely to generate much sympathy among taxpayers with that complaint. ... The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> ought to be glad that every taxpayer does not wait until April 15 to file.

The $ 1.1 trillion budget for 1989 ... has been received on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as his most realistic spending plan. The note of realism injected into this year's spending proposal reflects the two-year budget agreement <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reached with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year, after the stock market crash brought home the drastic need for deficit reduction. It reflects the politics of this year, an election year in which the president lacks the kind of muscle needed to push through daring new proposals.

 Feb. 17 Reading -LRB- <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> -RRB- Eagle on Social Security: Is Social Security strictly a retirement account, or is it an annuity that takes effect when a participant reaches age 65 and is eligible for full benefits, or reaches age 62 and is eligible for reduced benefits? That's the argument that has flared in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> once again as the effort is launched to eliminate the $ 8,400 a year earnings cap. Those who support the proposal ... argue that -LRB- the cap -RRB- punishes the elderly. Critics insist the original intent of Social Security was to provide income after retirement. They tread on uncertain grounds, however, when they bring up the matter of the original intent of Social Security. Original intent ... was changed in a wholesale manner by ... revisions: A notable example of that is that widows of farmers who never paid Social Security taxes were granted benefits. Also, ... the earnings cap ends at age 70. If earnings are a factor between the ages of 65 and 70, why not after 70? Repeal of the earnings cap is clearly in the public interest.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it is studying new screening techniques that may further reduce the chances of the AIDS virus being transmitted through blood donations. The <ORGANIZATION> AABB </ORGANIZATION> said the new study was prompted by reports that `` have raised concerns about the safety of blood transfusions administered to over 4 million people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> annually.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AABB </ORGANIZATION> cited a study published Feb. 25 in the New England Journal of Medicine which traced 13 units of blood infected by the AIDS virus back to seven people who donated blood even though they had been recently exposed to the virus. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a fatal disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from infected pregnant women to their offspring. Donated blood is routinely tested for the HIV virus, but the tests are able only to detect antibodies which may not develop until long after the exposure to the virus. The <ORGANIZATION> AABB </ORGANIZATION> said its study will test for the HIV antigen, a marker that may appear in the blood of an infected person before the antibodies. `` The results of this study will determine if an antigen test would be useful in detecting individuals in early stages of infection who donate blood,'' the statement said. It added that there are currently no tests for the antigen that have been licensed. Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AABB </ORGANIZATION> president, said current tests are `` nearly'' 99 percent sensitive, but do not detect people recently exposed to HIV. `` We expected that there would be some infection developing in transfusion recipients,'' he said. `` We are working on solutions to the problem of detecting persons even earlier iln this infectious state, and on how to discourage them from donating blood.'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> added: `` The risk from not getting a needed transfusion is infinitely greater than the risk of getting one.'' The federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> estimates that at least 12,000 Americans have been infected by the AIDS virus from transfusions given before rigorous blood-screening programs were adopted that reduced the presence of the virus in blood supplies to less than one unit in 50,000. As of Feb. 15, AIDS had been diagnosed in 53,814 Americans, of whom more than half, or 30,158, have died since 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. AIDS kills by destroying the immune system, leaving patients susceptible to opportunistic infections which often prove fatal. Blood banks now screen donor candidates for AIDS risk factors, but the <ORGANIZATION> AABB </ORGANIZATION> said it would review these procedures to determine if they should be tightened. The <ORGANIZATION> AABB </ORGANIZATION> is the world's largest organization of blood banks and transfusion services, with 2,500 members. It accredits blood banks and transfusion services and sets standards for agencies collecting nearly half the nation's donated blood.

He has put the nation in hock to the hilt, and mortgaged the future of our children and their children.

Interest payments alone cost $ 140 billion a year. ... To be sure, the president has had lots of help getting us into all this trouble. It was only with the help of a spineless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he was able to borrow vast sums to finance his massive defense buildup and to offset revenues lost in his tax-cutting programs.

Why do that? To fix the outcome, silly. What other reason could there be? A coalition of congressional members wants to do that in 1990 when the Constitution says the country must conduct a decennial head count. About 40 House members want to count everyone but illegal aliens and will sue the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> to force the exclusion.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, battered in the early Democratic contests, said today he is bypassing the March 8 Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses because he does `` not have the resources for winning'' them. But the Illinois Democrat said he was not dropping out of the race and would continue to campaign to win his home state primary on March 15 and the contests in the states that follow. `` The campaign will begin anew after Super Tuesday, starting in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was dealt a crippling blow Tuesday when he finished far behind <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and was trailing <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s caucuses. He came in a distant fourth in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary behind Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr.. Last week after coming in third in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he would withdraw if he did not finish first in either <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> He later backed off that statement. Faced with primaries and caucuses in 20 states and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> on March 8, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he can not raise the money to match the big warchests of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in the region. `` There is no sense in my fooling myself,'' the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Democrat said. `` We just do n't have the money.'' His campaign plunged into debt before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, but he has been talking of close to half a million dollars gathered in the past two weeks. `` We have had record-breaking fund-raising,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> declared. `` Monday, for example, $ 137,000 came in. We never had a day like that before. But you take $ 137,000 and then look at 20 states and what it would cost for a media buy, and you're talking about something that is nowhere near adequate.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> also said he had made the judgment that March 8 will not settle the race and that the battle for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination will go to the convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July. `` Super Tuesday is likely to result in a very mixed picture,'' he said. `` Phase one of the selection process ends on March 8. ... But we do not have the resources for winning in the Super Tuesday states.'' `` Phase two of the selection process begins March 15. I shall use phase two to deliver the message that we must become a nation with leadership characterized by compassion and vision and common sense. It is on to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with that message.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is on the ballot in all the Super Tuesday primaries, but he said he will do little or no campaigning in those states _ except for the nationally televised debates that are a major feature of the next two weeks. `` I'm not writing off the South. I want my friends there to vote for me,'' he said. `` I'm realistic about resources. I simply can not do everything.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> have split the four major Democratic contests so far. And <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he had concluded the party will not have a certain winner going into the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention. He cited `` growing evidence that for the first time in recent history there will be no first-ballot winner at the Democratic convention.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s best day so far was in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> on Feb. 8, where he finished a very close second to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. He was third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. He talked to reporters after a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel.

<HEAD>Southern Republics Have Long Posed Ethnic Problems for Kremlin</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Armenia, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Kremlin's attempt to bring 100 nationalities under one communist umbrella has been difficult in the southern <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> region, where dozens of ethnic groups strive to assert their identity far from the seat of Soviet power. About 50 different nationalities have been identified in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> area, some represented only by a few thousand individuals largely isolated amid the remote mountain valleys. The main peoples of the region are the Azeris, Georgians and Armenians, all of whom have their own Soviet republics. Armenians drew attention this week because of demonstrations in their capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, and in a small adjoining area that is part of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>. Thousands of demonstrators in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> demanded that the area, the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, be made part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is a microcosm of the inconsistencies of Soviet nationality policy. Its population of 157,000 was 81 percent Armenian and just 18 percent <LOCATION> Azeri </LOCATION>, but the region was made part of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> in 1923 after having been deeded to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> when it became part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1920. The <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> residents tend to be fiercely independent, bristling at attempts by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s dominant ethnic group, the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION>, to interfere with their languages, customs and religions. In <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, the most bitter fuel to nationalist passions occurred while <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> controlled western <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in 1915. More than a million Armenians are believed to have died or been massacred when <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> deported the local population. Other Armenian nationalism stems from religious beliefs, which are discouraged by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government. Patriarch Vazgen I of the Armenian Church said in an interview at church headquarters in <LOCATION> Etchmiadzin </LOCATION> last year that the majority of Armenians are believers and that more than half of newborns are christened. The region's turmoil has led many Armenians to leave their homeland, settling principally either in other parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Armenian emigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> approaches 1,000 per month. To the north, Georgians say they have been more successful than their <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> neighbors at resisting `` russification'' because they tend to stick close to home, limiting assimilation. But Georgian students protested by the thousands in 1979 when the republic's government tried to change the official language to Russian. Georgians' spirit of independence is reflected in their business dealings. They are known for doing a brisk business growing produce in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s Mediterranean-like climate and selling them in areas where supply is scare. <PERSON> Azerbaidzhan </PERSON>'s wealth traditionally was the oil found in its capital, <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. But oil production has dropped, causing economic problems in the republic. Ethnic tensions have surfaced in areas of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> with large populations of Armenians. In addition to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, demonstrators have also asserted Armenian national rights in the village of <LOCATION> Chardakhlu </LOCATION>. The village was the scene in October of a clash between native Azeris and long-time Armenian residents. There also is a sizable Moslem population in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>, which is officially tolerated by the Kremlin but serves as yet another wedge between the republic's people and the Russian-dominated <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> government.

But in the end the men won out, with 71 percent of the women saying they would give up their best friends to keep their husbands, while three percent were undecided, the magazine said. The Hamburg-based magazine did not say how many women took part in the survey.

 About 100 <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students occupied a dormitory office for a second day in a protest over racism and marched across campus today to present a list of 12 demands to the college president. The group then withdrew to the <ORGANIZATION> Dakin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office they seized Tuesday morning and said they did not plan to meet again with president <PERSON> Adele </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> until 9 a.m. Thursday. The protesters deliberately delayed negotiations, said <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Predmas </PERSON>, a junior from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` We are building our sense of our community, so we can feel invincible,'' she said. The protesters were escorted across campus by about 100 students, who snaked through a classroom building and a building housing administrative offices chanting, `` One, two, three, four. Racism has got to go.'' Among the protesters' demands were additional library materials dealing with Third World nations, establishment of a college policy on racial harassment, a full-time adviser for minority students, a permanent meeting place for non-white students, a minority recruitment week each semester, and no retaliatory actions against the protesters. About a dozen white supporters pitched tents and staged an overnight vigil outside <ORGANIZATION> Dakin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and students from nearby <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> colleges as well as the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> joined the demonstraters this morning. A week ago about 125 minority students at the University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> began a six-day occupation at a building there. `` The problems are the same, although the sizes of the minority communities are different,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> freshman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Fearman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` There's a general feeling here that we've been more or less pushed under the rug,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Fearman </PERSON>, who is black. Although there have been racial attacks at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, there have been none at <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, which lists 100 minority students among its 1,100 undergraduates. But minorities complained of verbal harassment and a lack of attention to Third World issues. `` We have been to the administration several times over the past three years with our demands and concerns and nothing has been done,'' <PERSON> Premdas </PERSON> said. `` It's been all lip service. It seemed this was the only way to get something done.''

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. FALWELL-HUSTLER The court overturned a $ 200,000 award won by evangelist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> against Hustler magazine and its publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>, extending the legal protections for parody and satire, even when they are pornographic. The court unanimously ruled that even pornographic spoofs about a public figure enjoy the free-speech protections of the Constitution's First Amendment if those spoofs could not reasonably have been interpreted as stating actual facts about the person. The case is Hustler vs. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, 86-1278. RENT CONTROLS The court expanded the power of communities to impose rent controls, ruling that hardships to tenants may be considered when landlords seek rent increases. By a 6-2 vote, the justices upheld a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, ordinance that has been attacked as a `` Robin Hood'' law that steals from the rich to pay the poor. The case is <PERSON> Pennell </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, 86-753. ENTRAPMENT The court broadened protection for criminal defendants who claim they were enticed by law enforcement officials into committing a crime. By a 6-2 vote, the justices overturned a bribery conviction against <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> official. The case is <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 86-6109. DEFENDANT'S TESTIMONY The court made it a bit easier for prosecutors to talk to criminal trial juries about a defendant's failure to testify. In splintered voting, the court reinstated the mail fraud conviction of a man who prosecutors say set his tennessee home afire so he could file a false insurance claim. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 86-937. DEFAULT JUDGMENT The court bolstered the right default-judgment losers have to challenge a judgment entered after they fail to respond to a lawsuit. The justices unanimously ruled for a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> businessman in his challenge of a default judgment awarded against him six years ago for a $ 5,000 debt owed to a medical center. The case is <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 86-1430. LAWYERS FEES The court ruled that federal judges lack authority to order the government to pay fees to lawyers who successfully obtain overdue federal welfare for poor people who are aged, blin or disabled. The 8-0 ruling in a case from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> held that federal officials are not required by law to withhold a portion of a recipient's benefits to pay the attorney. The case is <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Galbreath </PERSON>, 86-1146.

 Angry Palestinians today lynched an Arab who they apparently suspected of collaborating with the Israelis, stringing him up on a utility pole after he went on a shooting spree that killed a 4-year-old boy and wounded 13 other people, security sources said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio called the incident in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village `` a serious escalation'' of the unrest in the occupied territories and linked it to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s calls to deal with collaborators. The dead man's identity was not immediately known. Details were sketchy concerning the incident in <LOCATION> Qabatiye </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. However, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the violence began when hundreds of residents marched to the man's house, threw firebombs and setting it afire Security sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the man shot into the crowd, which apparently suspected him of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, killing the boy and wounding the others. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the crowd then dragged the man away and hanged him. Security sources confirmed the report. An army spokesman said soldiers arrived after the hanging. According to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, 63 Arabs have been killed, most by soldiers, since the wave of unrest began Dec. 8 in the occupied territories. A general strike gripped the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today as businesses shut down and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers stayed home in response to a call for stepped up protests before Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> arrives. Also today, the army reported what it said may be the first armed attack against the military in the past 2 -LCB- months of unrest in the territories seized by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. An army spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a bomb exploded on a road near <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> as a vehicle was passing Tuesday night and shots were fired. There were no injuries. Extra-tight security arrangements went into effect today at <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> airport in advance of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s arrival Thursday. Airport police said riot police units were called in and will stay on duty through Tuesday as <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> conducts his shuttle mission in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today, few people were on the streets and only one or two cars were seen moving. Most Arab laborers stayed away from their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, there was little public transport, and there were reports of a few scattered tire-burning and stone-throwing incidents. Much of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was dusted white with a thin layer of snow that fell overnight and some Arab youths in a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> neighborhood threw snowballs at passing cars, a relief from the stone-throwing of previous days. Business was at a standstill today. There was little traffic and few workers left home, according to <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. The underground National Leadership of the Uprising, in leaflets distributed throughout the territories, called for a general strike today and Thursday. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is coming to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to launch a new peace initiative he hopes will put an end to the violence of past weeks, bring the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> and Israelis to the negotiating table and eventually achieve an overall solution to the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> conflict. The secretary of state has acknowledged he has only a slim chance of accomplishing that goal during his visit. The Shultz initiative, which includes trading territory for peace, is likely to encounter opposition from Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION>. Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, said on Tuesday the new initiative contradicts the 10-year-old Camp David agreement. `` There is confusion in it and an attempt to sell it to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> David </ORGANIZATION> and to sell it to the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> that will give them almost all of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has prohibited local Palestinians from meeting <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> lawyer who was among a group of Arabs who met with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official on Saturday, said: `` As far as we are concerned there wo n't be a meeting.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said he did not know if Palestinians will meet with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Informed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would not meet with Palestinians outside <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` We're not taking directions from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> on how to meet with Palestinians,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Energy Aid Cuts Produce `Pain, Stress, Homelessness,' Study Says</HEAD>

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed cuts in programs to help the poor keep warm in the winter and cool in the summer will cause `` pain, stress and homelessness,'' a congressional report said Wednesday. A proposed $ 518.3 million cut in federal energy assistance for the poor in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fiscal 1989 budget would drop to 13 percent the eligible heating and cooling expenses covered by the program, which provides assistance to 6.7 million households, Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., said in releasing the study by the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> In 1981, the year <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office, federal energy assistance for the poor covered nearly 25 percent of eligible heating and cooling expenses, <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> said. `` The considerable erosion of federal support is all the more shocking considering the fact that ` eligible costs' represent only about 40 percent of a recipient's energy bill,'' <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> said. The declining funding for the program, an outgrowth of the oil crises of the 1970s, comes amid a background of rising energy costs, the study said. In 1981 the nation spent $ 7.47 billion on heating and cooling, and in 1988 the cost likely will be $ 9.67 billion, the study said. `` Many poor families in this country are threatened with the loss of their home heating and other basic utility services because they can not afford to pay their bills,'' the study said. `` As a visible result, the nation's poor experience a high level of pain, stress and homelessness.'' The program `` is grossly and tragically underfunded,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., the co-chairman of the coalition `` Both the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are to blame _ the administration for failing to honor its long-stated commitment to the safety net, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for acquiescing.'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> said they oped to stave off further cuts in the program and to roll back last year's 16 percent reduction in funding. The institute is a policy group formed by senators and representatives from the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>.

 Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is asking a federal judge to order former mayor <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and the people who bribed him to pay $ 1.5 million in restitution to the city. In a letter to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McAvoy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Probation Officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> asked that the city be named a victim of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s extortion-kickback scheme in the pre-sentence report now being prepared. If that request is rejected, the city may sue <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and five or more local businessmen who paid bribes for city contracts, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` If your household was robbed of cash and valuable jewels and the thieves were found, along with some of the loot they stole, who'd receive the stolen cash and jewels? Obviously the owner of the home,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` I'm head of the household. We're requesting that what's been stolen from this household be returned to it.'' <PERSON> Waterson </PERSON> declined to comment specifically about the <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> case, but he said consideration of restitution to the victim of any crime is a matter commonly brought up during sentencing. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and nine others who pleaded guilty to federal charges of racketeering, tax evasion and conspiracy will be sentenced March 10 and 11. The charges stemmed from a probe by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> into corruption during <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s tenure as mayor from 1970 to 1986. `` The administration believes the city was a victim, and we're doing the best we can to recover as much of the assets as possible,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> Counsel <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrigan </PERSON> The city is asking for a portion of the money <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> has returned to the federal government, as well as restitution from the ex-mayor and his associates, <PERSON> Harrigan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> already has surrendered $ 1.4 million in cash, bonds and coins to the federal government. The ex-mayor could be sentenced up to 30 years in prison, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney will recommend a term of 10 years. Federal authorities have said they will administer a lie detector test to <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> next week to determine if he is withholding any other illegally gained assets.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Began to Shrink in Late '87</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's record trade deficit began to shrink in the final three months of 1987 as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports climbed 6 percent to record levels, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. While narrowing just $ 200 million from the summer, the decline of the trade deficit to $ 40.2 billion on a balance-of-payments basis marked the first quarterly improvement since the spring of 1986. `` We have a genuine export boom going on and I think a lot of people are are pleasantly surprised,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON>, undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs. <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said further improvements were likely in the months ahead at present levels of the dollar, which he said appears to have stabilized in foreign exchange markets. Still, the year finished with a record $ 159.3 billion balance-of-payments trade deficit for all of 1987, the report said. In terms of volume alone, the trade deficit actually showed a 5 percent improvement from 1986 to 1987. The fact that import prices rose more rapidly than export prices helped mask this improvement, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts said. The new figures confirmed an end-of-year narrowing of the trade shortfall that already had shown up in the department's monthly merchandise trade reports. The earlier figures showed a $ 43 billion deficit for the fourth quarter and a $ 171.2 shortfall for all of 1987. Wednesday's figures were smaller because they subtracted factors such as the cost of shipping, insurance and military sales from the monthly numbers. The balance-of-payments deficit is also adjusted for seasonal variations; the monthly figures are not. The October-December deficit was down from the $ 40.4 billion deficit sustained in the third quarter. That figure was revised upward from the $ 38.9 billion originally reported. Exports, buoyed by a weakening exchange value of the dollar, increased $ 3.9 billion, or 6 percent, to a record $ 69.1 billion. Imports also rose to a record $ 109.2 billion in the fourth quarter, but the increase of 4 percent or $ 3.8 billion was smaller than that for exports. The report was cited by analysts as further evidence that exchange-rate changes since 1985 finally are helping to trim the trade deficit. The dollar is worth just 50 percent of its mid-l985 value against Japanese and key <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies, a devaluation that is making imports more expensive to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers while making <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods cheaper and more competitive abroad. `` The trend has changed. Exports will continue to grow and I think you will see a major decline in imports in the first, second and third quarters of this year. The biggest surprise of 1988 will be the narrowing of the trade deficit,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> bond brokerage. During the fourth quarter, the trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> increased $ 1.3 billion to $ 15 billion; the deficit with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was up $ 1.5 billion to $ 8.2 billion, and the shortfall with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> rose $ 100 million to $ 1.8 billion. In the same period, the deficit with the newly industrialized countries in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> _ fell $ 2 billion to $ 8.1 billion. Non-petroleum imports increased $ 5.3 billion, or 6 percent, to $ 98.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Passenger cars from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> were up 52 percent, a $ 1 billion increase. Auto imports from all other countries, including <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, fell by 7 percent, or $ 700 million. Petroleum imports decreased $ 1.5 billion, or 12 percent, to $ 11.1 billion. Both prices and volume were down. On exports, non-agricultural shipments of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products increased $ 4.5 billion, or 8 percent, to $ 61.3 billion. Among the largest increases were machinery, up $ 2.1 billion or 12 percent, and automotive products to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, up $ 1 billion or 21 percent. However, agricultural exports fell during the quarter by $ 600 million, or 7 percent, to $ 7.7 billion. If `` constant'' dollars were used, subtracting the effects of inflation since 1982, the trade deficit would show a $ 1.2 billion decline in the fourth quarter, to $ 41.4 billion. For the year, the deficit would have shown a decline to $ 168.6 billon, from a hypothetical $ 177.4 billion constant-dollar deficit in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will use the figures to calculate an even broader measure of trade, the current account deficit, which measures not only trade between countries in merchandise, but also in services, primarily investment earnings and transfer payments such as foreign aid.

We want to separate any criminal activity from regulatory activity.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials received the toxic dumping reports in mid-January, several weeks after the Jan. 2 collapse of an <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> tank near <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> fouled the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers with an estimated 730,000 gallons of diesel fuel. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., on Tuesday asked <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the reports Traces of chloroform and methylene chloride, which both cause cancer, and another industrial solvent, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, were found in water samples by the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, according to officials in that department. They found no hard evidence, however, that the toxins were deliberately dumped to take advantage of the <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> pollution crisis, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, branch head of field opertions for the natural resources department. The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that the toxic chemicals were found in a 15-mile stretch of the river between Wheeling and <LOCATION> Moundsville </LOCATION>. The concentrations exceeded the levels set by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> as cancer risks, but probably had no effect on public health, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>, water quality program manager for the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` The intakes of all the water companies were shut down as the spill passed,'' <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> said. `` Also, those compounds ... are easily removed by the carbon filtration systems water companies use.'' The tank collapse cut tap water service to about 23,000 suburban <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> residents and threatened to do the same for an estimated 1 million others. Water companies along the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which is formed by the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, closed their intakes and relied on reserves and emergency supplies until the diesel fuel passed. The <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has helped process 70 claims against <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> from municipal governments seeking a total of about $ 1 million, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Critchfield </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PEMA </ORGANIZATION> disaster assistance officer, said Tuesday at a meeting of federal, state and local officials involved in the spill.

 The son of one of first two men to conquer <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> has set his own sights on the mighty mountain, joining a team that hopes to scale the world's highest peak to mark the 35th anniversary of the feat. <PERSON> Tenzing </PERSON> <PERSON> Norbu </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> travel agent and the son of <PERSON> Tenzing </PERSON> <PERSON> Norgay </PERSON>, said he joined the expedition to honor his late father, the <PERSON> Sherpa </PERSON> guide who joined <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edmund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hillary </ORGANIZATION> at the top of the world in 1953. `` For me, it is a pilgrimage to a mountain which has reshaped the lives of my family and my people,'' <PERSON> Tenzing </PERSON>, 25, said at a news conference Wednesday. `` It will allow me to pay homage to my late father. The young <PERSON> Tenzing </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> graduate who works for a travel agency in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, only will go as far as the base camp, about 17,000 feet, on the Chinese Tibetan side of the mountain that straddles the Nepal-China border. The final assault on the summit of the 29,028-feet peak, the world's highest, will be made by an international team of mountaineers led by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 30, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> native now living in <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, joined by two other Americans and a British climber, will attempt to reach the peak without oxygen by an untried route along the eastern side of the mountain. Like the Nepalese Tenzing and <PERSON> Hillary </PERSON> in 1953, the `` Everest'88'' expedition will be supported by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinther </PERSON>, chief cartographer of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretariat </ORGANIZATION>, will travel to the base camp and the climbers will have a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> flag to plant on the summit. The group leaves <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Thursday for <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. From there, they will begin a five-day journey accompanied by 45 yaks to a site where they will set up their base camp. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who came within 800 feet of the summit in a 1985 expedition to <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION>, said the team hopes to put a man at the peak by the end of April. He said the climbers will forgo oxygen to relive some of the challenge of the original assault, much of which has been diminished by technological advances in climbing equipment. <PERSON> Tenzing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hillary </PERSON> used oxygen in their climb. The young <PERSON> Tenzing </PERSON> said he will give the summit assault team objects similar to those his father took up the mountain, including a wooden black cat, a broken pencil and candy to pay respect to the mountain gods. <PERSON> Tenzing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hillary </PERSON> reached the summit on May 29, 1953. Since then, 209 people have conquered the mountain, but only about 15 without oxygen, according to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tenzing </PERSON> <PERSON> Norgay </PERSON>, the `` tiger of the snows,'' died in May 1986 at the age of 72 in Darjeeling, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where he set up a climbing school. <PERSON> Hillary </PERSON>, now Sir <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON>, is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The two men kept their vow never to reveal which first set foot on the majestic pinnacle.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today it has boosted its production plans for 1988 by 175,000 cars and trucks, will recall 8,600 laid-off workers and reopen a temporarily closed assembly plant. `` The strengthening demand for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> vehicles reflects the ongoing product quality improvements resulting from plant modernization and employee involvement programs,'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> said in a statement. `` This combined with very competitive retail incentive programs has increased the value of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> products,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will increase production by running some plants, particularly for trucks, on overtime; restoring second shifts at two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants and one in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>; and reopening its closed <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, assembly plant. At the three plants where <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> had dropped the second shift, workers from both shifts were sharing jobs by alternating between two weeks on layoff and two weeks on the job, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> assembly plant, which <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> closed abruptly Nov. 30, will reopen May 9 on one shift with 2,000 of its 3,700 workers. The plant will build the Oldsmobile Cutlass Cierra, but will not resume production of the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celebrity </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said.

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s new attorney says he will seek a postponement of the impeachment trial before the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which is set to start Monday. `` We will be requesting ... that the trial be postponed,'' <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said in an interview late Tuesday night. He said he would meet today with state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who is presiding over the trial, and with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON>, a Republican, noted today that the trial already has been delayed a week and added, `` My inclination is to not give them another minute of delay. ... I think it's a tactic. I think they've known all along what they were going to be doing.'' Meanwhile, the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s impeachment prosecutors today asked that contempt sanctions be imposed against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> for refusing to provide a list of planned witnesses before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial begins. Prosecutors William French and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckstein </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of `` patent, blatant disregard and disobedience'' of a deadline set by <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, also said he planned to meet with <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said he was retained by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> Monday night. `` I am certainly very enthusiastic to take the case,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. `` We're going to put together a very strong defense in his behalf, a very forceful, fruitful, responsible defense and hope that the members will be persuaded by it,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunton </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Mohave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman and founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Mecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> was hired as the lead defense counsel. <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, chief spokeswoman for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s recall election campaign, said Tuesday night that <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> had been added to the defense team, `` but I'm not sure of the terminology, whether he is the lead attorney.'' She said she believed that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, the attorney for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, would handle the criminal defense. In addition to the impeachment trial, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother face felony charges stemming from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s alleged failure to properly report a $ 350,000 campaign loan. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> ran unsuccessfully for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> in 1968 and in 1969 was named director of the <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> by President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. He also served as an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

French and <PERSON> Eckstein </PERSON>, in their motion for contempt sanctions, said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s defense should not be permitted to call any witnesses during the trial unless they meet today's 5 p.m. deadline to provide a list. The prosecution submitted a list of 41 possible witnesses Monday. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said in a letter Monday he did not want to disclose his planned witnesses because he thought it was unfair to hold <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial before his criminal trial is over <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> also had set a 9 a.m. deadline today for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> to file any objections to the impeachment counts, but no documents were filed by that time. <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON> said he thought the deadlines set by <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> appeared to be more of a request than an order, and questioned whether sanctions could be imposed if there was no direct order involved.

 Evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who is said to have confessed an obsession with pornography, once wrote a newspaper column saying pornography is as addictive as drugs. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> faces disciplinary action by his denomination, the Assemblies of God, for sexual misconduct. He was reportedly observed and photographed while visiting a prostitute in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, one of 13 members of the Assemblies of God's ruling executive presbytery, said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had confessed last week to having an obsession with pornography dating back to his youth. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, a member of the denomination's general counsel, said Monday night that the panel had been given pictures of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> going in and out of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> motel room with a woman In a July 1986 column for the <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> Sunday Advocate, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> wrote: `` Pornography is now considered as addictive as drugs, leading, as with any addiction, to a need for escalated ` doses' and intensity. That, in turn, breeds desensitization, which leads to the acting out of roles that have been at the heart of the nation's most sensational serial murder and serial rape cases `` Women and children, portrayed as nothing more than debased objects on screen and in print, pay a particularly high price when fantasy turns into reality.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> called those who make their living from pornography `` wretched, disgusting and dangerous.'' In another column, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> wrote: `` Most of today's sex, I'm afraid, is a consequence of lust, and that has absolutely nothing to do with love `` You see, the laws of God can not be abrogated with impunity. Yes, we can do it, we are free moral agents. To do so, however, means that we ` pay the piper,' and we're now starting to do so.'' The December issue of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s magazine, the Evangelist, was critical of <ORGANIZATION> Mercer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a Baptist school that did not take disciplinary action against six women who posed for <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazine. `` It seems to us that if the standards set forth in the Word of God were truly being taught, neither the girls nor the university would find themselves in this embarrassing circumstance,'' the magazine said.

 Portuguese Prime Minister <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, disappointed in American aid levels, said today his nation wants to review a 1983 U.S.-Portugal defense agreement giving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> access to a key air base. <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, emerging from a two-hour meeting at the White House with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said he told the president that cuts in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid have posed difficulties `` particularly at a time when we are committed to the re-equipment of our armed forces and trying to modernize the country.'' `` I stated to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> government intended to request that consultations be held under the terms of the agreement,'' <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reiterated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> desire to help <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, but he said `` the efforts remain firm, even within the context of the harsh budger realities that we all face. The task of leadership is to rise to the challenge.'' The <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> leader is using his first official visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to register disappointment that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is providing barely more than half the $ 205 million that <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> wants in aid each year for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rights at <ORGANIZATION> Lajes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>, a vital refueling point in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit-reduction program is responsible for the cuts, not just in aid to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> but to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> _ other base-rights countries with struggling economies. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters in advance of <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today, said `` we're going to have a foreign policy job to do in convincing them why we're doing it and why we have to share the pain together.'' <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> arrived on Tuesday for three days of talks. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> is disappointed in the aid levels, which have dipped to $ 117 million this year after hitting a high of $ 205 million in 1984, one year after the current base agreement was signed. In his budget proposal last week, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for $ 163 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he doubted the prime minister wanted a `` confrontation'' during his visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Rather, we'll look for ways we can figure out _ at least in the short run _ some of our problems,'' the official said. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> appeared to have soothed <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> feelings enough to head off a request for a formal review of the U.S.-Portugal defense agreement. He received permission from <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s government to send over surplus <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military equipment to make up part of the shortfall in financial assistance. Experts from both defense departments are to meet soon to figure out what <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> can use from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks. In the past two weeks, however, <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Deus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinheiro </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> have expressed reservations about the plan. Nevertheless, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, `` I think what he -LRB- <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> -RRB- told <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> at the beginning of February, we expect, holds. `` Obviously the Portuguese are disappointed with the levels of assistance. So are we,'' the official said. `` Invariably we've requested more money out of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and in recent years have not done very well As the budget crunch is being faced by all agencies, obviously security assistance is one of those areas hit. `` We're probably going to face it in a great amount of countries, particularly countries that feel they have a commitment for a certain level of military assistance and believe that they have been good allies.''

<HEAD>Dukakis, Attacking Negative Ads, Wants Campaign ``Back On The High

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Wednesday he will do whatever he has to do to counter any negative ads by his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination but hopes `` we can get this campaign back on the high road.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's second-place showing in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary Tuesday was blamed in part on `` attack ads'' by top vote-getter <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> chairman <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiecking </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The ads claimed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has no farm or trade policy and is the biggest taxer in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> history. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called the ads inaccurate. At a news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` maybe it is a vain hope'' for the Democrats to avoid the kind of charges and countercharges circulating among the Republican candidates, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> termed damaging to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, their candidates and the election process. `` I would prefer that the Democrats not copy the Republicans, and that we try to run strong, positive campaigns in which if we disagree with each other we do so agreeably and accurately,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. But he added, `` negative campaigning and negative advertising apparently is the thing all of the sudden. I have had to go through that before, and if I have to do what I have to do, I will do so. But I would hope that we can get this campaign back on the high road.'' Asked to elaborate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I'll deal with that when the time comes. I've had to do it before, I hope I do n't have to do it -LRB- again -RRB-.'' But he did specifically mention <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the American people `` are not interested with what Mr. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> thinks of Mr. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, Mr. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> thinks of Mr. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, what both of them think of me. `` These two guys are at it every day. Now they are trying to get me into it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` There is nothing wrong with disagreeing on particular issues,'' he said. `` I have no problem with that. But I would hope we could avoid it -LRB- negative campaigning -RRB-. Can we? We'll see.'' Saying he was the only <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate competing with equal force in all states, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> summed up Tuesday's results, including his victory in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, by saying, `` We competed aggressively in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, competed aggressively in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. And the results, I think, are very heartwarming.'' But as the candidates head toward Super Tuesday March 8, with 1,307 delegates up for grabs in 20 states and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think any of us is in a strong position. I think it's wide open. `` Super Tuesday is two weeks ahead, and if there is one thing that we are learning as a result of this -LRB- process -RRB- is that nobody knows what's going to happen next,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said Wednesday that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is n't buying the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committees' proposals for preventing another Iran-Contra affair, including a required 48-hour notice to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of any covert action. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said the proposals would tie a president's hands in cases where a premature leak could cost lives, and when a foreign intelligence service with vital information insists that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not be told. A 48-hour notification requirement would `` promote tension'' between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a president `` for years to come,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> added. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> that a recent presidential directive would make certain all but the most extraordinary covert activities would be promptly reported to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. And in any rare case where the president ordered a delayed notification, a top-level policy group would review the decision every 10 days, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. Some lawmakers have suggested that they might have persuaded <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> not to sell arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had he notified the intelligence committees or congressional leadership of his plans. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approval was withheld from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for 10 months in 1986, until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were disclosed by a Lebanese publication. The administration has already lost round one in its battle to maintain greater discretion on when to notify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 13-2 for legislation that includes the 48-hour requirement. It is similar in other respects to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> is now trying to derail. `` A bill which fails to preserve the flexibility and authority the president needs to conduct intelligence activities effectively will not be acceptable to the president,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. He did not say specifically whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto such a measure. Current law requires an administration to give the intelligence committees or eight top congressional leaders prior notification of significant intelligence activities. But it allows the president to delay in extraordinary circumstances, and issue the notification in `` timely fashion.'' In fact, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said, there have been only three instances when timely notification was not given: the Iran-Contra affair, the rescue of Americans from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> who were hidden by Canadian diplomats and the failed military attempt to rescue American hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said the Iran-Contra affair, in which profits from the arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were diverted to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, was caused by `` officials failing to follow existing procedures and rules.'' `` Some allowance must be made for that rare case where a limited delay in congressional notification is critical to preserve the absolute security of an operation when, for example, lives are at stake,'' he contended. But former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> testified that the legislation does not go far enough. He suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stop financing any covert activity for which notification was not given. And he proposed that any government employee who willingly violated the prohibition of funds be subject to criminal activity. `` We are better off without covert activities entirely than with them out of control,'' said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, who served in the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> administration.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today overturned a $ 200,000 award won by evangelist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> against Hustler magazine and its publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>, extending the legal protections for parody and satire, even when they are pornographic. The court unanimously ruled that even pornographic spoofs about a public figure enjoy the free-speech protections of the Constitution's First Amendment if those spoofs could not reasonably have been interpreted as stating actual facts about the person. The justices stripped <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> of the award he had won for `` emotional distress'' caused by an advertising parody in Hustler. `` Outrageousness in the area of political and social discourse has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of the jurors' tastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a particular expression,'' Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> wrote for the court. `` An ` outrageous' standard thus runs afoul of our longstanding refusal to allow damages to be awarded because the speech in question may have an adverse emotional impact on the audience,'' he said. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s lawsuit arose out of a full-page `` ad parody'' that appeared in the November 1983 and March 1984 issues of Hustler, a sexually explicit magazine. Featuring a photograph of <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, the ad purportedly quotes him discussing a sexual encounter with his mother and describing himself as a habitual drunkard. At the bottom of the page in small print readers are told that the ad is a parody `` not to be taken seriously.'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> charged Hustler and <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> with libel, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. He asked for $ 45 million in damages. A federal jury in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in late 1984 ruled that the ad did not libel <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, and the presiding judge threw out the invasion-of-privacy allegation. But the jury ruled for <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> on his emotional-distress allegation, and awarded him $ 200,000. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the award, but today's decision threw it out. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, a Baptist minister and founder of an organization known as the Moral Majority, said he had sued <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> and his magazine to protect his late mother's reputation. `` I ca n't imagine any red-blooded male in the world not being incensed,'' he told reporters when attending <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> arguments in the case last December. `` I fully appreciate the deep concerns the court has shown for the sacredness of the First Amendement,'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said in a statement today. `` However, I respectfully disagree with their ruling. Just as no person may scream `` Fire!'' in a crowded theater when there is no fire, and find cover under the First Amendment, likewise, no sleaze-merchant like <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> should be able to use the First Amendment as an excuse for maliciously and dishonestly attacking public figures as he has so often done. `` I believe the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has given the green light to <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> and his ilk to print what they wish about any public figure at any time with no fear of reprisal.'' <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>, who also attended the December argument session, had voiced concern about his fate before the high court but added, `` My indictment is mainly for bad taste.'' He said today, `` I'm excited, absolutely delighted. Even though the suit had no merit in the beginning, I still spent over $ 1 million in attorney's fees. There is no way to get those back. It's what you call paying to defend the First Amendment. <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> added: `` With this record on the book, I have protected ... other newspapers and magazines. I'm not talking about pornography. We are blazing a trail for a lot of people, like political cartoonists.'' In today's decision, the court noted that `` graphic depictions and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public and political debate.'' It discounted <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s contention that the Hustler parody was so outrageous that it should be distinguished from more traditional political cartoons. `` There is no doubt that the caricature of -LRB- <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> -RRB- published in Hustler is at best a distant cousin of the -LRB- traditional -RRB- political cartoons, and a rather poor relation at that,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. But he added that there is no way the law can punish one and let the other flourish. The court's vote was 8-0. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court last Thursday, did not participate in the decision. In other action, the court: _ Expanded the power of communities to impose rent controls, ruling that hardships to tenants may be considered when landlords seek rent increases. By a 6-2 vote, the justices upheld a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, ordinance that has been attacked as a `` Robin Hood'' law that steals from the rich to pay the poor. _ Broadened protection for criminal defendants who claim they were enticed by law enforcement officials into committing a crime. By a 6-2 vote, the justices overturned a bribery conviction against <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> official. _ Made it a bit easier for prosecutors to talk to criminal trial juries about a defendant's failure to testify. In splintered voting, the court reinstated the mail fraud conviction of a man who prosecutors say set his tennessee home afire so he could file a false insurance claim. _ Bolstered the right default-judgment losers have to challenge a judgment entered after they fail to respond to a lawsuit. The justices unanimously ruled for a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> businessman in his challenge of a default judgment awarded against him six years ago for a $ 5,000 debt owed to a medical center. _ Ruled that federal judges lack authority to order the government to pay fees to lawyers who successfully obtain overdue federal welfare for poor people who are aged, blin or disabled. The 8-0 ruling in a case from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> held that federal officials are not required by law to withhold a portion of a recipient's benefits to pay the attorney. The Hustler case was Hustler vs. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, 86-1278.

 A <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration proposal to reduce the questions asked in the 1990 Census drew fire Wednesday from city officials and statisticians who said vital information would be lost. The White House Office of Management and Budget has required that several questions be dropped, or asked of fewer people, in this spring's Census dress rehearsal. No final decision has been made on whether the changes will be extended to the 1990 census, according to <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>, who contended the cuts were made to reduce the paperwork burden on the public. But the dress rehearsal head counts in the states of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> are scheduled for March 20. On April 1, the formal questions planned for the 1990 census must be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The proposed changes would introduce `` crippling sampling errors'' into the Census, charged <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, retired chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s housing division. Young spoke at a joint hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging and the subcommittee on Housing and Consumer Interests. `` It will look like a full census, but it will be nothing but a hollow shell,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Eliminating questions or cutting by half the number of people answering some of them would all but eliminate much data on city block areas, he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> cuts will leave the nation after the 1990 census with a housing data base inadequate for decision making at the local level,'' he said. And this loss of information would occur at a time when more and more programs are being switched from federal to state and local operation. <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, added the warning that the cuts `` could have potentially debilitating impacts upon the cities of this nation to adequately plan for the future and to allocate scarce resources for the betterment of their residents and businesses.' You do n't have to be a statistician to know that reducing the number of people asked a particular question reduces the quality of the data collected, <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> went on. Cities use census information to target community development block grant funds and economic development money, to prepare housing master plans, to target neighborhood eligibility for federal, state and local assistance and to pinpoint areas in need of programs, he said. The cities depend on the census every 10 years as their primary source of information, and all other collections of information use the census as a base, or are mere estimates, he added. The <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> proposal would drop questions on the cost of utilities, type of heating equipment and fuel used to heat water. In addition seven questions would be moved from the short form answered by everyone to the longer form sent only to a sample of households. Those include information on number of rooms in a house, plumbing, rent and value, presence of a telephone and whether the residence is a condominium.

 Taxpayers are apt to get the wrong answer to one of every four tax questions they telephone to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the agency acknowledged Tuesday. Even correct replies may not be complete. `` We are obviously not satisfied with answering only three out of four questions correctly,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said in reporting the results of a test of his employees. He questioned the validity of a separate survey by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which found even less chance of a correct answer. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, made 224 calls to <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> telephone `` assistors'' and got the correct answer to only 61 percent of the technical tax questions asked; 57 percent of the answers were complete and 4 percent were accurate but incomplete. <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stathis </PERSON>, an associate director of <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that because of the limited number of calls and because they were not statistically weighted, the results `` are very preliminary and not projectable at this time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> expects 22 million telephone calls for tax answers this filing season. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' own survey is based on 5,000 calls to some of the 4,500 agency employees whose job is to answer taxpayers' questions about how to fill out their tax returns. Sixty-one percent of the questions were answered completely and correctly and another 13 percent were answered correctly but not completely. At this time a year ago, before most provisions of the massive 1986 tax overhaul took effect, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> was giving the correct answers to questions 79 percent of the time. `` I am comfortable that we are answering three out of four questions correctly,'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said. But Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> oversight subcommittee, said, `` With one-fourth being given the wrong information, I do n't know that that is a complimentary figure.'' No matter the source of advice on filling out a tax return, the taxpayer has the responsibilty to see that the return is correct. Even if the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> makes a mistake in its advice, a taxpayer can be subject to a penalty and interest for underpaying. The agency traditionally has waived penalties if a taxpayer can prove a mistake resulted from bad IRS advice, but there is a question whether the law permits interest on an underpayment to be waived. Because of the new law, <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said, he is not surprised that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> assistors are giving more wrong answers than they did a year ago. He noted Money magazine had asked 50 tax professionals outside the government to calculate how much tax a hypothetical family owed and had received 50 different answers. `` Very simply, taxpayers, practitioners and the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> are having trouble coping with the magnitude and the velocity of tax-law changes,'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said, noting that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has fallen into the habit of passing a major tax bill almost every year. In the 1986 overhaul, said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulze </PERSON>, R-Pa., `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may have passed such sweeping tax changes'' that they will prove impossible to implement Most of the changes in that new law _ including lower rates, fewer deductions and higher personal exemptions _ are being reflected for the first time on the returns that are due by April 15. If another <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> survey is any indication, the 1986 law brought anything but simplification. The agency asked 423 taxpayers outside <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> offices in six cities how preparing this year's return compared with last year. The results: _ 43 percent said it was harder or much harder this year _ 32 percent found little difference _ 13 percent said this year was easier or much easier _ 10 percent were not sure Overall, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s Ms. <PERSON> Stathis </PERSON> said, `` <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> did a good job in trying to prepare its employees and the taxpaying public for the 1988 filing season.'' In addition to the problem with incorrect answers to telephoned questions, she said some <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> offices have run out of certain tax forms. Some tax professionals also have complained that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has provided insufficient guidance on some fine points of the new law, she added. About 84 percent of taxpayers who went to <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> offices for advice were satisfied with the result, and 74 percent received assistance within 15 minutes, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found.

<HEAD>Watkins Urges $20 Billion, 10-Year Effort To Deal With IV Drug
Users</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> commission recommended Wednesday that federal and local governments spend an additional $ 20 billion over the next decade to fight AIDS among drug abusers. Retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, head of the AIDS commission appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last summer, acknowledged that the call for such massive spending on drug addicts might prove controversial. But he said 200 hours of testimony from 350 witnesses has left the panel convinced that the deadly disease is spreading most rapidly among the nation's estimated 1.3 million intravenous drug abusers and their sexual partners. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> noted that some health leaders are estimating 10,000 to 20,000 infants could be infected with the AIDS virus three years from now as a result of sexual unions involving drug addicts who can easily spread the disease among themselves by sharing contaminated needles. Any realistic attempt to combat AIDS in general must focus on drug abusers, he said. Health leaders have long feared that any significant outbreak of AIDS into the general population most likely would start with the sex partners of IV drug users, most of whom are concentrated in 24 major cities. The full 13-member AIDS commission is expected to adopt most or all of <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' recommendations at a day-long business meeting next Monday and then formally submit them to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the following week in what will be the panel's first substantive report. A final report is due at the White House June 24. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> promised it will get into such controversial areas as widespread AIDS testing, discrimination against people with AIDS and other legal and social questions. He said the commission would be `` at loggerheads with ourselves'' if it tried to agree on recommendations on those matters at this point. The commission will turn specifically to hearing testimony on those topics next month. Meanwhile, he said, the panel saw no reason to delay making recommendations in areas where there was consensus. There could be subsequent interim reports before the final one this summer, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' call for an additional $ 1 billion a year in federal spending on drug abuse intervention programs alone would nearly double the total $ 1.3 billion <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> AIDS budget <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has proposed for fiscal 1989. The retired chief of naval operations told reporters that state and local governments will need to increase their own combined spending on drug programs by a like amount and that both the federal and local efforts will need to continue for 10 years. `` You can not just throw in some money one year and drop it out next year,'' said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. He said only 15 percent of the nation's intravenous drug abusers are in treatment plans and tht there are three - to six-month waiting lists in most major cities for addicts seeking help in getting off drugs `` Anyone crying for help should get help on demand,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. Another major theme among <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' 60 pages of recommendations is additional financial support for the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which he characterized as `` a kind of orphan agency standing on their own'' in the annual budget fights. `` We're picking up his advocacy,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said of <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. The chairman said the panel had toured <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in surburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and concluded `` we look something like a Third World agency out there.'' He noted that the new <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget proposes $ 25 million for an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> laboratory. `` We're saying he needs another building'' in addition to the one proposed, said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> expressed confidence that the full commission would adopt most of his recommendations and declared, `` It is not in our charter to worry about the political impact.'' Asked his reaction to the possibility of presidential candidates, particularly Democrats, using his recommendations to `` zing the White House'' for not doing more earlier, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> replied: `` How do you avoid politicizing something in an election year? If they all adopt this and say ` Let's get on with it,' that's the kind of politicization I like.''

 Two teen-agers have been arrested after a series of violent armed robberies and a slaying in which one of them allegedly portrayed the sadistic character in `` Nightmare on Elm Street.'' In all the incidents, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Regino </PERSON>, 18, allegedly used a sawed-off rifle, wore a blue bandana over his face, and donned a fedora, a guise worn by the film's protagonist, Freddie, who had knives attached to his fingers, said Police Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>. Thursday night, a man was robbed, ordered to strip, and then shot as he fled from a robber calling himself Freddie, <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said Tuesday. The victim told police the robber had said, `` ` You'll never meet anyone like me again,''' the officer said. A sawed-off rifle, trenchcoat and blue bandana were discovered at <PERSON> Regino </PERSON>'s parents' home in the neighborhood where most of the attacks occurred, <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Regino </PERSON> is alleged to have been involved in at least eight armed robberies and one killing since early January, several involving an accomplice, <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Regino </PERSON> was booked for investigation of murder Monday and was being held withox a | the Harbor Divison station The alleged accomplice, a 16-year-old whose name was withheld because of his age, was being held for questioning, said Sgt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kallestad </PERSON>. The two teen-agers are believed to be gang members, and <PERSON> Regino </PERSON>, who was taken into custody at a drug treatment center, may have been a PCP user, <PERSON> Kallestad </PERSON> said. The attacks blamed on the pair started Jan. 5 and ended Sunday when $ 300 was taken from a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant. On Jan. 7, a 49-year-old man was killed after being robbed and shot several times while he apparently slept in his truck. A passerby who stopped to help was also assaulted, police said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> combat training over <ORGANIZATION> Everglades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> would spoil the wilderness and threaten endangered species, the state Cabinet concluded Tuesday.

A second site is being examined southwest of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Alligator </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION>. The training missions would not use live ammunition or bombs, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials say the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> missions would be cheaper than continuing to send figters to other bases for combat training. Homestead, once solely a training base, has been converted to an active fighter base. The base is home to two wings, the 31st and 482nd. In October, it will have three squadrons of F-16s and F-4s.

 A crisis over an unconstitutional state budget blew over Wednesday almost as quickly as it developed after <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> officials agreed to continue government as usual until they hear more from the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The high court issued a 3-2 opinion on Tuesday calling the budget unconstitutional because it contains a $ 26 million deficit. But the court granted a 60-day grace period during which the order would be suspended while a rehearing is requested. Check-writing officials were thrown into a panic initially, with Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> saying he would not process any more state bills. But <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> reversed himself overnight and said Wednesday he would process the checks as usual. He called the high court's ruling a `` whimper in the wind'' and said it carried enough delays to put off any final action until the new fiscal year that starts on July 1. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> released a number of checks for hospital workers on Wednesday. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s reversal also apparently clears the way for the state payroll to be distributed on Monday as scheduled. Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> already has scheduled a special session of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> for April 12 to look at education matters, and the budget problem presumably could be considered at that time. The governor has a possible safety valve. On Tuesday, he received a bill that would allow him to borrow up to $ 50 million from the state's pension and workers' compensation trust fund, said gubernatorial press secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>. If he signs the bill, it might be possible to solve the crisis by simply dumping $ 26 million into the current budget. Auditor <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON>, who also signs the state's checks, said he questions whether the loan is legal but said he would not contest it in court. A lawsuit filed last fall by the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> challenging $ 13.5 million in cuts in education this year sparked the high court decision. The unprecedented ruling comes as lawmakers grapple with bills that Gainer estimates will be $ 170 million by the June 30 end of the fiscal year. In addition, lawmakers are trying to write a budget for the next fiscal year. Tax collections are $ 35.7 million behind predictions this year, and a national investment firm issued a national bond rating warning against <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on Dec. 15 because of the financial crisis facing the state. House Finance Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> suggested his colleagues simply ignore the high court decision and continue to work on the budget for next year.

 The city of <LOCATION> Baytown </LOCATION>, banking that City Hall may be sitting on a pool of oil, is looking in its own back yard for more income. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has approved a plan for <ORGANIZATION> Trace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and Gas to drill a shallow 5,000-6 ,000 - foot well near the entrance to the 30-acre, wooded City The city would receive a 20 percent royalty on any petroleum uncovered under the agreement. `` We're keeping our fingers crossed,'' said <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON>, mayor of this town of 57,000 people about 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` If the well brings in $ 100,000 a year, we could knock a half-cent off our tax rate.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a geologist and co-owner of Trace Oil in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, projects the company has a 50-50 chance of hitting oil. `` We feel confident. We drilled a well 500 feet south of there on <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> last year and got the smell of oil,'' he said. After careful calculations, his research indicated an oil pool could be trapped beside a fault under the lush complex, he said. The company has permission to drill about 2,000 feet from the city buildings. An 80-foot derrick will be erected and the drilling will continue around the clock for five to six days, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. If oil is discovered, a fence will be erected around the site and landscaping will be used to disguise the oil pumping operations, he said. `` We made stipulations in the lease so that it wo n't be a messy operation,'' <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON> said. The company will spend about $ 150,000 on the prospecting venture. `` We expect it could bring in anywhere from $ 500 to $ 15,000 per day in revenue, which is a minor find,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. The prospect of oil under the building is not outlandish, said Assistant City Manager <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Rountree </PERSON>. `` After all, this is an oil town,'' agreed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Exxon, one of the world's largest refineries, made <LOCATION> Baytown </LOCATION> what it is today.''

<HEAD>High Court Expands Parody Protections by Rejecting Award to
Falwell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> expanded significantly the legal protections for parody and satire Wednesday as it overturned a $ 200,000 award evangelist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> had won against Hustler magazine and publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>. The justices ruled unanimously that `` emotional distress'' lawsuits filed by public figures targeted by such spoofs should be as difficult to win as libel suits. And the court unanimously said that even pornographic spoofs enjoy the free-speech protection of the Constitution's First Amendment. The Hustler material was a phony ad purportedly quoting <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> discussing an incestual encounter with his mother in a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> outhouse and his habit of getting drunk before giving sermons. Small print at the bottom of the page said the ad was `` not to be taken seriously.'' Led by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, the court rejected <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s arguments _ and a <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling _ that some parodies are so outrageous they do not deserve legal protection. `` Outrageousness in the area of political and social discourse has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of the jurors' tastes or views,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said, adding that such results are constitutionally impermissible. The decision was praised by news organizations. `` It's easy to stand up for nice talk from nice people but the First Amendment protects all speech, even the outrageous,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McMasters </PERSON> of the Society for Professional Journalists. `` Editorial cartoons have been a particular target of lawsuits lately,'' <PERSON> McMasters </PERSON> said. `` The court was right to speak up so forcefully on behalf of ... tools editorial cartoonists wield so well.'' But <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, a Baptist minister and founder of an organization called the Moral Majority, disagreed. `` No sleaze merchant like <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> should be able to use the First Amendment as an excuse for maliciously and dishonestly attacking public figures,'' he said after learning of his defeat. `` I'm sure the justices were holding their noses while making the ruling.'' <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> said he was `` absolutely delighted'' by the ruling. `` Even though the suit had no merit in the beginning, I still spent over $ 1 million in attorney's fees. ... It's what you call paying to defend the First Amendment,'' <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He said he was concerned about small newspapers and house organs and others unable to afford to fight such a battle. `` They just go out of business,'' <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>'s opinion drew a distinction between the Hustler ad and more traditional forms of parody such as editorial cartoons, calling the <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> spoof `` a distant cousin of the political cartoon, and a rather poor relation at that.'' Following publication of the parody in November 1983 and March 1984, <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> sued Hustler, a sexually explicit magazine, and its publisher for $ 45 million in damages for libel, invasion of privacy and the intentional infliction of emotional distress. He won on the emotional-distress allegations only and a federal jury in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, awarded him $ 200,000 in damages in late 1984. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the award. But the high court said the same tough standard of proof <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> faced in trying to prove he was libeled should have applied as well to his emotional-distress allegations. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> since 1964 has required that free-speech considerations be taken into account in libel cases. But those considerations never before have been required in emotional-distress cases. In order to win a libel suit, a public figure must prove that the allegedly libelous statement was false and was made with `` actual malice'' _ knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity. Until Wednesday, winning an emotional-distress suit was easier for public figures. They only had to prove that the defendant intended to cause the distress, that the defendant's conduct was extreme and that emotional distress actually was suffered. Now, if public figures sue over some spoof _ whether alleging libel or emotional distress _ they must meet the actual-malice standard of proof. And in proving falsity, they must show that the spoof reasonably could have been interpreted as stating actual facts. The court's vote was 8-0. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court Thursday, did not participate in the decision. In other decisions, the court: _ Expanded by a 6-2 vote the power of communities to impose rent controls, ruling in a case from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that tenant hardships may be considered when regulating the increases sought by landlords _ Ruled unanimously in an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> case that federal judges may not order the government to pay fees to lawyers who successfully obtain overdue federal welfare benefits for the aged, blind or disabled _ Made it a bit easier for prosecutors to talk to criminal trial juries about a defendant's failure to testify as it reinstated a man's <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> mail fraud conviction _ Broadened protections for criminal defendants who claim they were enticed by law enforcement officials into committing a crime by overturning, 6-2, on entrapment grounds a <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> man's bribery

 Democrat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, admitting `` there is no sense in my fooling myself,'' said Wednesday his battered presidential campaign is skipping the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses to try to recover from four straight defeats. Republican also-ran <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> vowed he, too, would press on despite an 0-5 record. Unlike <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said he would take his chances in the clump of primaries in the South and elsewhere on March 8. `` I'm in this all the way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>'' and the GOP convention in August, said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` It is on to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'' and the Democratic convention in July, echoed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator, has yet to win a Democratic event, watching <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> split the early contests. So he said he will skip the South and focus on his home state primary on March 15, one week after Super Tuesday. `` The campaign will begin anew after Super Tuesday, starting in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. Money is the problem <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> sees in the South. `` There is no sense in my fooling myself,'' the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Democrat said. `` We just do n't have the money.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s campaign plunged into debt before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, but he has collected close to half a million dollars in the past two weeks. `` We have had record-breaking fund-raising,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` Monday, for example, $ 137,000 came in. We never had a day like that before. But you take $ 137,000 and then look at 20 states and what it would cost for a media buy, and you're talking about something that is nowhere near adequate.'' `` I'm not writing off the South. I want my friends there to vote for me,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> added. `` I'm realistic about resources. I simply can not do everything.'' On the Republican side, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he was outspent in the Tuesday contests in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, but that would not happen in the South. Senate GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won both contests, with former evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> coming in second. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trailed. `` We beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. ... I was outspent 8-to-1 by <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and probably 10-to-1 by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. We're going to match them dollar-for-dollar in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s hopes have been badly shaken by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s strong showing in the early caucus states. And <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has said that he will win the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> primary on March 5, the door-opener to the Super Tuesday primaries. `` I think last night proved the race is wide open. That's all I really needed. I needed to break up the idea that this is a Bush-Dole race. This is no longer a Bush-Dole race,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> finished second in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and fourth in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Among the Democrats, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he has concluded that the Super Tuesday contests will continue the early pattern of confusing results with no clear front-runner emerging _ leading to a brokered convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` Super Tuesday is likely to result in a very mixed picture,'' he said. `` Phase one of the selection process ends on March 8. ... But we do not have the resources for winning in the Super Tuesday states.'' `` Phase two of the selection process begins March 15. I shall use phase two to deliver the message that we must become a nation with leadership characterized by compassion and vision and common sense. It is on to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with that message.'' He cited `` growing evidence that for the first time in recent history there will be no first-ballot winner at the Democratic convention.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> claimed he was in second place in the delegate count, but the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count places <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in third place with 33 delegates, behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 44.5 and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> with 39. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> aides said he is claiming delegates out of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, even though the returns allocating the delegates there will not be known until March 8. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is on the ballot in all the Super Tuesday primaries, but he said he will do little or no campaigning in those states _ except for the nationally televised debates that are a major feature of the next two weeks. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s best day so far was in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> on Feb. 8, where he finished a very close second to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. He was third in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and then fourth in the Tuesday contests.

<HEAD>Networks Scaling Down Super Tuesday Coverage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two of the networks have decided that the Super Tuesday primary is so unlikely to produce a clear winner in the presidential nominating races that they are cutting back on their planned prime-time coverage. CBS had planned to pre-empt its entire prime-time schedule for Super Tuesday coverage on March 8, but decided Tuesday to cut back to two hours. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which had planned a two-hour special, cut it to one hour. `` The reasoning is that after <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, we determined that Super Tuesday was not going to be as conclusive as previously thought,'' said NBC News spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McAndrew </PERSON>. `` In planning coverage, we protectively booked two hours and decided we could cover it comprehensively in one.'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the network decided the public was n't interested enough in the primary results to spend more than two hours. `` What we did was took a look at the public's attitude in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, what the public's reaction to the coverage in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> was and did a reevaluation of what the reaction was going to be to the primaries that take place on March 8 and said to ourselves, from an editorial point of view and journalistic point of view, can we really fill three hours in a meaningful way that the audience would want to watch?'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was sticking to its plan to have two hours of coverage, despite the fact that Tuesday is its highest-rated night of prime-time programming. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> will have comprehensive coverage throughout the evening, beginning at 6 p.m. EST. On PBS, `` The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' will wait until Wednesday to assess the results. `` Because we're not stupid, we're going to avoid projecting or predicting what may happen,'' said associate editor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON>. `` It is so diverse and diffused down there, who knows what all of these many, many results are going to add up to when it's all said and done.'' This is the first year for Super Tuesday, when 20 states, most of them in the South, will select delegates to the two presidential nominating conventions. Coverage of the event, stretching from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, has confounded the networks, who are additionally hampered by budget cutbacks in the news divisions. Before the presidential campaign began, the networks believed Super Tuesday would likely clinch the race in one or both parties. But after the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary failed to produce clear frontrunners, the networks decided Super Tuesday was less likely to be decisive. `` The networks are backing and filling. They're less sure than they were that we'll actually know who the nominee will be,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>. `` You have to assume at present it's going to be an extremely diffuse result. We may come out of this not knowing a thing.''

<HEAD>Reagan Seeks Enactment of `Truth-in-Spending' Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the `` Truth in Federal Spending Act'' aimed at attacking budget deficits with a pay-as-you-go approach to new programs. The legislative proposal is part of the `` economic bill of rights'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced last July. It would force the executive and legislative branches to spell out the costs of programs and legislation. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the bill `` will help us carry out the important goals'' reflected in the deficit-reduction accord reached in the aftermath of the Oct. 19 Wall Street crash. Faced with indications of growing investor uneasiness with red-ink budgets, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and leading lawmakers signed the Nov. 20 agreement calling for a two-year, $ 76 billion reduction program. That accord also provided for $ 9 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1, and $ 14 billion in fiscal 1989. In asking for enactment of the truth-in-spending bill, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the agreement with congressional leaders `` reflects a strong consensus that federal spending must be brought under control.'' `` Protecting the federal budget from special interest, budget-busting legislation requires a continued, ongoing commitment,'' he said in a message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Despite recent encouraging efforts to bring the federal budget deficit under control, major problems persist.'' The truth-in-spending proposal was among several <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> unveiled last July 3 in a speech at the Jefferson Memorial here. Other components of the so-called `` economic bill of rights'' included a balanced budget amendment and line-item veto authority for presidents. It also contained a proposal to require a `` super-majority'' vote, rather than a simple majority, for enactment of tax hikes. The truth-in-spending legislation would require executive agencies and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to submit legislation and programs that are `` revenue neutral.'' Each piece of legislation would have to be accompanied by a financial impact statement showing how much it would cost, and proposing concurrent cuts in other programs, or increases in federal revenues, to cover the costs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his message he wanted to make it clear that there is no intent in the legislation `` simply to shift'' the costs of legislation from the federal to state and local governments. In another development, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the president will not propose legislation to rescind pork-barrel spending as he promised in his State of the Union address. `` It will not be in the form of a package of rescissions, but a list'' for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to review, he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The president will be `` leaving it up to you, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. If the president proposed rescissions, those accounts would be frozen for 45 days while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decided whether to make the cuts permanent in a process with procedural advantages. The list, however, would have no force of law. Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., criticized the administration for focusing so much attention on small items that `` really add up to a hill of beans'' compared to the huge budget deficit problems `` Every dollar counts,'' he said, `` But keep matters in perspective.'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> also complained that the administration touts its own initiatives _ such as buying new leather flight jackets for the military _ as good government while congressional priorities become `` pork barrel.''

<TEXT>
 A Moslem guerrilla leader said Wednesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has struck a secret deal with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to betray the insurgents fighting to overthrow <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, head of the extremist <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, reiterated his vow to keep fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> until peace is forged on the insurgents' terms. Speaking to reporters and diplomats, he said evidence of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s alleged betrayal was its acceptance of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer to begin removing <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15 if a U.N.-sponsored peace accord is signed next month. Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, and by Western estimates 115,000 are still there. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said the Soviet pullout would leave the country in the hands of the communist <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, making it impossible for the nearly 5 million Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to return home. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -LRB- made the offer -RRB- without making a deal with the Americans,'' he said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> recently has insisted that any <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accord on foreign intervention in the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> conflict include an agreement that an interim government would be installed in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> during the withdrawal. Asked why he thought the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would betray the guerrillas after supporting them throughout the war, <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said, `` That's an impertinent question.'' Asked whether his group would continue to accept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid, he said, `` Nobody can buy us or sell us out.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, comprising the seven political factions of the insurgents, this week announced its own blueprint for a government to replace the Soviet-backed one in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. It envisons a joint executive committee composed of all seven guerrilla leaders to preside over a 28-member cabinet composed of mujahedeen, Afghan refugees and `` Moslems presently living in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.'' The plan says the head of the cabinet would also be head of state but it did not suggest who would have that post. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s said that if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the mujahedeen's headquarters, signed a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accord without the guerrillas' approval, they might change their external operating base to The next round of peace talks is scheduled to begin March 2 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have been the principal negotiators in the talks. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has indicated it might not sign any agreement until a new government is installed in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Dollar Decline Has Opened Opportunities for US

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday the decline in the value of the dollar has opened opportunities for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters but they could be undermined by protectionist legislation being considered in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fact that the dollar's exchange rate is at a far more realistic level is of great significance'' to the market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, the president told members of <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Now </ORGANIZATION>, a public-private group organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Commmerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` New opportunities are emerging because of the adjustment in the value of the dollar,'' he said. `` At the current exchange rates many American companies can now quote a lower price to customers in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> than their competitors and still make a higher profit than on sales in the domestic market.'' In addition, he said, `` In the last few years, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry has been going through an unprecedented period of renovation, computerization and modernization.'' `` What we do n't need now, however, is protectionisn that undermines all the progress we've made,'' the president said. `` I strongly urge <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to send me a trade bill that does not imperil our ability to export by causing other countries to close their markets,'' he said. `` We should n't shoot ourselves in the foot after we have worked so hard and are in a position to win the race.'' The president said legislation being considered by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> contains provisions that encourage exports `` and we do n't want to lose those.'' But he said other provisions would violate the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs and make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business less competitive. `` We ask for your support to ensure that we do n't end up with an economy-killing, protectionist bill,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the group. Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> introduced <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying he was to `` make introductory remarks and wave the flag.'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said the president had told him `` in no uncertain terms'' that the <ORGANIZATION> Comemrce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would lead an effort to expand sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods overseas. The commerce secretary said there `` has been a tremendous improvement in the climate for exporting.'' He attributed that to an exchange rate that favors the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to an administration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` that cares and would like to do more'' to stimulate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales abroad.

 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ Republicans angrily complained of `` banana republic'' tactics Wednesday after armed Capitol police broke into GOP Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s locked office, arrested him and hauled him feet-first into the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber during an all-night filibuster over Democratic campaign finance legislation. On a motion by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Sergeant at Arms <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> was handed warrants for the arrest of absent <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators, thus forcing them to answer a quorum call and keep the filibuster It was after midnight, more than 10 hours after the filibuster began, when <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> and five armed plainclothes Capitol policemen began stalking <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hideaways and senators' suites in nearby office buildings. <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> found several senators' offices empty but saw Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, running down a hallway to escape arrest. Then in an extraordinary incident that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> historian said had not occurred since 1942, <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> used a passkey to unlock <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s office door <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Witeck </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Republican, said <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> resisted and somehow jammed a finger he had broken two weeks ago in a fall. `` He tried to hold the door closed with his shoulder, but they were able to push it open,'' <PERSON> Witeck </PERSON> said. `` I had to shove in the door to get into his office,'' said <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON>, a stocky Army veteran of World War II and former vice squad policeman in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` I think he hurt his finger. He was very courteous.'' <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> walked with <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> and his police escort a block or so from the <ORGANIZATION> Russell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Office Building to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wing of the Capitol but refused to `` walk on the floor willingly,'' <PERSON> Witeck </PERSON> said. At that point, three policemen grabbed <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> by his ankles and both arms and carried him bodily into the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber, feet first. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> later went to a hospital, where X-rays showed that his left hand _ enclosed in a cast _ had not been reinjured during the scuffle with <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON>. `` I rather enjoyed it,'' <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> told reporters later. `` I instructed four of my staff to bring a sedan chair. But except for the honor of it, I'd rather walk.'' <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said he bolt-locked his main office door after his staff reported that <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> would try to arrest him. The senator said `` it sounded like a battering ram'' at the door, with his shoulder pushing from inside against three shoulders on the other side. `` Their mass beat my mass,'' <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said, adding that he suffered only swollen knuckles. <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> served the arrest warrant signed by the presiding officer, Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., after 1 a.m. On a more serious note, <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said the campaign spending bill has no chance of becoming law, because <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans have more than enough votes to sustain a certain veto by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and that <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> succeeded only in alienating his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> colleagues <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s arrest provoked angry clashes between Democrats and Republicans. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said the incident brought to mind the police-state measures of `` Nazi <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and communist <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. He protested that <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> was hustled into the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber like a `` common criminal.'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, complained of `` banana republic'' tactics, and said <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s arrest `` flaunted the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He proposed a change in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules to forbid any future arrest of absentee senators. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., responded that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators had engaged in a `` shameful display'' of fleeing the chamber to avoid a quorum call, requiring <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> to search them down like a `` headmaster chasing schoolchildren. `` Senators went off in a dead sprint,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>. `` They should have been in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> in one of the Olympic events.'' The incident was prompted by a walkout by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators from the filibuster that they had started in opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal to impose voluntary spending limits in general election campaigns for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The Republicans charge that the bill was a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> attempt to discriminate against them in states with a heavy Democratic edge in registered voters. They began a filibuster early Tuesday afternoon to prevent the Democratic majority from bringing the bill to a floor vote they are virtually certain to win. But when the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators failed to answer repeated quorum calls requiring the presence of a majority of no fewer than 51 senators, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> invoked a parliamentary rule that requires every senator to attend floor sessions unless excused. After a series of roll calls failed to lure Republicans back to the floor, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> moved to have the sergeant at arms arrest the absentees and escort them to the chamber. His motion was approved, 45-3, with dissenting votes cast by Democrats <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The arrest warrants were signed by <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who was presiding over the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> at the time. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said later he had no choice but to resort to the arrest tactic because only 50 senators _ one short of a majority _ had answered the last quorum call and three Democrats were unavoidably absent. He appealed for an end to the Republicans' `` guerrilla warfare'' against the bill. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules provide that the sergeant at arms can be ordered to `` request'' or `` compel'' the attendance of absentees. If that does n't work, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> can `` direct the sergeant at arms or his deputies to arrest absent senators and bring them to the bar of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' Democrats and Republicans have been at loggerheads for nearly a year over the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal, which has 52 co-sponsors, to impose voluntary <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign spending limits of $ 950,000 to $ 5.5 million, depending on a state's population. Under the bill, a candidate who observes the voluntary spending limit would get campaign funds from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> if an opponent exceeded the limit or an independent group spent large amounts of money in opposition. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> historian <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the last time something similar to the <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> incident ocurred was on Nov. 23, 1942, when a deputy sergeant at arms carried a subpoena to the Mayflower Hotel and escorted Sen. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> McKellar </PERSON>, D-Tenn., to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for a vote on poll tax legislation

It may be difficult to wring concessions from <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. Many in his <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> are grumbling about the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> timing, worried that any change of position will create the impression that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is giving in to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> rioters. `` The country is in a very defiant mood,'' said a <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> adviser, adding that any hint of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure would likely backfire. The <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide said he doubted an agreement on starting negotiations with the Arabs was not possible in the five days <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has set aside for his trip. A more upbeat assessment came from <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>, director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are welcoming the initiative. We are welcoming the timing. We understand, all of us, that there is no military solution for the uprising in the territories but only a peaceful solution,'' <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON> said. `` I am far from thinking that it is an impossible mission,'' he added. The main difference between <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is over whether <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should exchange territory captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war for peace with the Arabs. The two also disagree over whether <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should participate in an international peace conference. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> favors the return of some land and has agreed to Jordanian King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s demand for an international conference. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposes returning land and argues an international conference would be a biased forum and would give the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> too great a say. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has tried to find middle ground in one disagreement by proposing that Arab-Israeli talks be launched at an `` international event.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who has accepted the idea of Soviet-American auspices, has not closed the door to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s proposal but asked the secretary for clarification on what kind of format he has in mind. To satisfy the Arabs, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> needs <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> approval for a land-for-peace trade. But his mention of this formula in a recent speech irritated <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and prompted him to send emissaries to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to stress that no pledge to give up land would be made in advance. `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> hinted at the possibility that he was ready to negotiate territory. We are ready to negotiate on the territorial issue, but that does n't mean we are ready to agree in advance to withdraw -LRB- from occupied lands -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, a legislator <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> sent to talk with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. A senior <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> official who demanded anonymity said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would try to hammer out guidelines for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> talks on both a temporary and a permament solution in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The first obstacle he faces in this quest is a U.S.-proposed, yearlong timetable designed to get the process moving before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Israeli elections in November. According to his schedule, an international conference would convene in April. Elections for a Palestinian self-rule council would follow in October, and in December, talks would begin on a final settlement. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s formula is designed to overcome <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> suspicions that negotiations would never move beyond the limited autonomy idea, a concept rejected by the Palestinians since it was first proposed in the 1978 Camp David Accords. The Palestinians seek an independent state, which is opposed by Israelis on both the right and left. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has demanded a confidence-building period of several years to set the stage for talks on a final disposition of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Not even the most optimistic Israelis are predicting <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will iron out the final guidelines for talks during his visit. The best they hope for is an `` initial breakthrough'' that will set the stage for further trips by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> or other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was dealt an early setback when <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> moderates were banned by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> from meeting with the secretary in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Without Palestinian participation, the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative is unlikely to have the desired calming effect on rioting in the occupied lands. In fact, his visit may have the opposite effect. Responding to leaflets calling for anti-Shultz protests, a general strike was launched on the eve of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s visit and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security officials are preparing for an escalation of violence.

 The later life of <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> entertainer known as `` the darling of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>'' in the Jazz Age, is documented in a collection of personal papers, photographs and clippings acquired by the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> library. The collection was assembled by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harford </PERSON> <PERSON> Janes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, who died last year before he could complete a biography of her. <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library bout the collection at auction in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in December. `` I knew that she was of ongoing interest,'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beinecke </PERSON> curator of American literature, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who died in 1975 at age 69, was known for her opulent costumes, singing and exotic dancing in the <ORGANIZATION> Folies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bergere </ORGANIZATION> in the 1920s. The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> native first dazzled French audiences in 1925 in her performance in the Revue Negre, or the black review, when she dressed in scarlet ostrich plumes and danced on a mirrored drum. That role, along with her love of the exotic, illustrated by a daily stroll down the Champs Elysees with her leashed pet leopard, earned her another nickname _ `` siren of the tropics.'' `` She was the first to have highly unusual costumes and to work with a chorus that was extravagantly beautiful, making a whole image of the stage,'' <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> collection, acquired in December, focuses on the second half of her life, beginning with her work entertaining Allied troops during World War II, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. The collection includes letters from Princess Grace of <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION>, and photographs and articles from the French and British press. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouillion </PERSON>, adopted 12 children whom they dubbed their `` rainbow tribe.''

 A test of a redesigned nozzle-to-case joint for the space shuttle booster rocket was set for Wednesday despite computer problems which forced a delay. The six-second test, the fourth of six Nozzle Joint Environment Simulator experiments and one of hundreds of tests of booster rocket components, was rescheduled for 3 p.m. MST at the <ORGANIZATION> Wasatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> plant of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 25 miles west of here. The joint was deliberately flawed to allow hot gases to blow past bonded adhesive insulation and one of three O-rings to reach the craft's main seal, or primary O-ring, said company spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>. He said the test was designed to evaluate the main seal's ability to contain any gases that might leak through the insulation and a `` wiper'' O-ring during a launch The test had been scheduled for 1 p.m. but was delayed because of unspecified problems with a ground computer, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. Engineers concluded after the third test of the joint on Oct. 8 that the O-ring system withstood gas pressure after a deliberate flaw was built into the joint, which connects the nozzle to the body of the segmented booster rocket. However, during a full-scale test on Dec. 23, a `` blow hole'' was detected in the joint's adhesive sealant _ a defect <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had not built into the test but one which officials described as `` very benign.'' For Wednesday's test, engineers created a quarter-inch by five-hundredths-inch hole through the bonded insulation and damaged the wiper O-ring _ two flaws aligned to assure a gas path in the joint up to the primary seal. <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said the double defects would subject the joint to `` a little bit more severe'' conditions than previous tests. `` Again, it's another step in the process of ensuring that this is a fail-safe and fault-tolerant design,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. `` It builds our experience base on the behavior of the joint, and it also serves as a precursor for the April full-size motor firing, which will have similar flaws,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. Blow holes can occur during assembly of the 126-foot rocket, `` so it happens here at the factory, if it happens,'' he said. <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said the test simulates `` the most difficult portion of the environment for the O-rings, that is the first one second'' of launch. The solid-fuel rocket booster was redesigned following the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle Challenger. The disaster, which killed the craft's seven-member crew, was blamed on a faulty seal in a booster joint that allowed hot gases to escape and ignite the shuttle's external fuel tank. While the blow hole detected in December was not considered a major problem, the failure of a nozzle boot ring during the same test prompted <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials to push back the June 2 target date for resuming shuttle flights. The launch of Discovery is now planned sometime in August. In addition to the final two NJES tests scheduled before shuttle flights resume, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> will conduct several more Joint Environment Simulator Tests of the booster rocket and three more full-scale horizontal tests, the first one tentatively set for early April, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Filing Tax Forms Through Computers Speeds Returns, IRS Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Up to 1 million taxpayers will receive federal refunds as much as three weeks earlier this year by having a professional file their tax returns directly into the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> computer. Already this year, 119,494 returns have been filed electronically _ compared with 77,612 for the entire filing season in 1987. If the taxpayers choose, their refunds will be deposited directly into their bank account. Although the number of electronic returns are up considerably this year, the volume of ordinary, paper returns filed so far is 6.7 percent below last year's pace. However, the gap _ which officials blame partially on the new tax law _ is closing each week. Through Feb. 19, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday, 23.55 million returns had been filed, compared with 25.24 million a year ago. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has processed 9.74 million of this year's returns, up slightly from 9.72 million last year The inventory of unprocessed return totaled 13.8 million last week, compared with 15.5 million a year ago. The number of returns qualifying for refunds is down 14.4 percent, a decline that <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> officials can not explain. Through last week, 3.8 million refunds had been certified; the figure was almost 4.5 million at this time last year. The average refund is bigger this year: $ 782 compared with $ 727. By the time all 107 million individual returns are filed this year, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> estimates, nearly 80 percent will qualify for refunds averaging about $ 1,000. It is taking the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> about five weeks to process a return and certify a refund check this year. But those taxpayers who file electronically are getting refunds within two or three weeks. This is the third year of electronic filing, and within three or four more years, says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, who manages the project, about 35 million returns will be filed annually by computer. Electronic returns save the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> considerable time, said <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, and these returns generally have fewer errors that would delay a refund. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> estimates electronic filing could save $ 200 million in processing and storage costs over the next 10 years. And if a taxpayer who files electronically chooses to have the refund deposited directly into a bank account, that saves the treasury 23 cents that would have been spent to issue and mail a paper check. So far, electronic filing is available only to taxpayers in 10 states and parts of four others who are due refunds and who pay any of about 2,000 professional preparers to fill out their returns. Although the preparer sends the completed return directly into the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> computer by telephone line, the taxpayer must sign a signature form which is mailed to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. Electronic filing is avaible in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> areas of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and San Jose areas of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> areas. All electronic returns are processed to <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> centers in <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 An anesthesiologist performed experiments on a comatose patient, his superior said Wednesday after <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s health minister suspended the doctor for experiments on another comatose patient. On Tuesday, a professor of medicine testified in a criminal trial in the western city of <LOCATION> Poitiers </LOCATION> that a doctor he did not identify had placed a deeply comatose patient, considered legally dead, on sabotaged medical equipoment. Professor <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lassner </PERSON> said the experiment was carried out to see if the effects were the same in the case on trial, in which a young woman died, possibly from medical sabotage. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Peria </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amiens </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that the experiment was carried out by Dr. <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> on 24-year-old man who had been in a deep coma since late January. He said the man's family had been notified and the patient survived the experiment. `` The experiment was videotaped and sent to Dr. <PERSON> Lassner </PERSON> so he could use it at the trial,'' <PERSON> Peria </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> proceeded without the consent of the hospital. <PERSON> Lassner </PERSON> gave his testimony in the trial of three doctors charged in the 1984 death of <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Berneron </PERSON> after her operation for a benign tumor at <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poitiers </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Berneron </PERSON>, then 33 and the mother of two children, apparently received nitrous oxide instead of oxygen after the operation and died of asphyxiation. An investigation showed that the tubes had been switched. <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> was condemned by the medical community after he admitted experimenting in 1985 on a 20-year-old comatose man. Health Minister <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzach </PERSON> on Wednesday ordered <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> suspended from his duties in <LOCATION> Amiens </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and asked the state prosecutor to investigate to find out who had carried out the latest experiment. The minister, a doctor, said she was `` indignant and revolted that in this country one can carry out experiments on humans, obviously without their consent, given their state.'' In comments during the 1985 controversy, <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> called patients in a prolonged, chronic vegetative state `` almost perfect human models, who constitute intermediaries between animal and man.'' In the 1985 experiment, he injected in two minutes a quart of blood into the patient's bone marrow to try to show this was a viable treatment for patients in shock. The man, comatose for three years, died within months but no link between the experiment and the death was established. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> condemned human experimentation. `` Human beings are not instruments,'' he said. `` Neither the search for truth nor scientific progress must distance us from this certitude, this value of civilization.''

<HEAD>Panel Calls for Doubling Spending on Public Works</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation must double its spending on public works projects ranging from highways to waste disposal plants to keep them from falling into ruin, a government-appointed commission said Wednesday. But in an era of high budget deficits and a push to reduce spending, not increase it, there are few signs that either <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the White House is prepared to embrace the call for spending billions of additional dollars for such programs. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he was introducing legislation calling for an additional $ 5 billion a year in public works spending, but aides acknowledged there is little chance the bill would go far this election year. The White House gave little notice to the report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION>, although it appointed three of its five members. The administration recently sent a proposed fiscal 1989 budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> calling for reduced highway and mass transit spending. The special government council, created four years ago to examine the nation's public works needs, concluded that `` the quality of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s infrastructure is barely adequate to meet current requirements and insufficient to meet the demands of future economic growth'' without sharply increased spending. `` For <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s public works, the yellow light is flashing. The danger sign is apparent. There is serious and very real cause for alarm,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giglio </PERSON>, the council's chairman and a Wall Street investment banker. `` If we do not act to shore up our nation's infrastructure, we could very soon be faced with enormous problems that imperil future economic growth,'' <PERSON> Giglio </PERSON> said at a news conference. The report called for all levels of government and the private sector to double their capital spending on public works projects from an annual level of $ 45 billion to $ 90 billion by the end of the century. The council criticized the federal government for hoarding funds in various public works trust funds _ a cash balance of $ 24 billion in 1987, according to the report _ but said additional revenue must also be obtained. It suggested possible sources of new money ranging from higher federal fuel taxes to local `` impact fees'' on developers. `` In most cases we can not rely simply on wiser spending. We also must generate additional sources of funding,'' the council declared. The five council members acknowledged that the call for billions of dollars of increased spending for public works comes as a variety of social programs, the military and other government needs are competing for limited funds. `` To throw one more urgent monetary request into the pot may seem foolhardy,'' said panel member <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is anything but. Ignoring our infrastructure, the foundation of our economy, will be even more costly in the long run.'' The study also included a `` report card'' on progress made in dealing with each major type of public works. The panel gave no failing grades. However, it raised serious concerns about efforts to deal with toxic wastes, which received a grade of D, as well as attempts to grapple with mass transit, solid waste disposal and waste water treatment needs. All three areas received a C or C-minus grade. Highway programs did a little better with a C-plus. Programs to manage water resources was given a B, the best grade, followed by B-minuses for aviation and water supply management. `` As a whole, this is a report card that would make most parents weep,'' said council member <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldmark </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Discussing hazardous wastes, the council said that while spending to clean up contaminated sites has increased fivefold in the last two years, `` only a small fraction of the 2 tons of waste per capita produced in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> each year is being treated safely.'' On water quality, the council suggested that governments at all levels have been fighting a losing battle. `` Despite -LRB- a -RRB- $ 44 billion federal investment in sewage treatment since 1972, water quality has not improved significantly. ... due in part to uncontrolled sources of pollution ...,'' it said. The report said overall spending on public works has declined from 3.6 percent of the gross national product in 1960 to 2.6 percent in 1985. Money for public works programs accounted for 20 percent of total government spending in 1950, but only 7 percent in 1984, it said. `` In effect, we're drawing down past investments without making commensurate investments of our own,'' the report said. `` Failure to reverse this decline will exact a high price for the nation in the future both in the cost of deferred investment and in reduced economic competitiveness.'' Other members of the council are <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, an engineering consultant from <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Freida </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallison </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, lawyer.

 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE _ <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has agreed to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s demand that the five permament members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meet to start peace talks. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposes the idea, arguing such a forum would be weighted against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and would give the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> too much of a say.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 LAND-FOR-PEACE _ <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> favors territorial compromise, returning some of the land captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war for peace agreements with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and other Arab states. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> says he is willing to negotiate the territorial issue, but he will not pledge in advance that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will return any land. His party views the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> as essential to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. Both leaders agree to giving Palestinians some form of autonomy as a temporary solution in the occupied lands.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> SHULTZ </PERSON> PLAN _ <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has expressed reservations, especially over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals to start talks by the end of the year on a final disposition of the occupied lands. He insists the five-year interim period called for in the Camp David Accords is needed to build trust between the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and Israelis. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has not objected to any elements publicly.

<TEXT>
 SOVIET INVOLVEMENT _ <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has argued the Soviets are already involved in the region. He conditions Soviet participation on a significant change in the number of Jews allowed to come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He has placed less emphasis on a demand for full diplomatic relations. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposes any opening that will increase Soviet influence and has insisted on full diplomatic relations and free emigration for Soviet Jews as conditions for any Soviet role.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> leaves open the possibility of talking to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> if the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> ends all forms of violence against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and accepts the right of the Jewish state to exist. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rules out any dealings with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders.

 Three Democratic presidential candidates could lose future federal matching funds based on poor showings in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary but they have 30 days to turn that around before the money is cut off. Democrats <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> became ineligible for matching funds by attaining less than 10 percent of the vote in two successive primaries _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> on Tuesday and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> a week earlier. But election law stays the actual cut-off of money for 30 days after the second primary, giving the candidates a chance to re-establish their matching fund status by doing better in a subsequent primary. During the 30 days, the candidates can continue to receive federal matching funds for every contribution of $ 250 or less that they raise privately. `` There is absolutely no harm done to the campaign by this,'' said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Risley </PERSON>. He added that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, by focusing his campaign on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, had never expected to do well in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> but anticipated better results before the 30-day period ended. The candidates can regain eligibility by achieving a 20 percent or better showing in a successive primary. That means they have a chance to redeem themselves on March 8 when the Super Tuesday series of 20 primaries occurs. Most of the states are in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where both <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> have strong support. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, said he anticipates no problem in keeping matching-fund eligibility. He said that since <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s respectable showing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses on Feb. 8, when he came in fourth, the campaign has raised $ 400,000. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s possibilities are weaker. His campaign organization is tiny and he raised only $ 70,000 during January. The matching money is distributed from an <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury account that is supported by the voluntary $ 1 checkoff on individual income tax forms. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contender <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> dropped below the 10 percent threshhold in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, but he redeemed himself with a 20 percent showing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. To be declared eligible initially by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>, a candidate must raise $ 100,000 across 20 states in contributions of $ 250 or less.

<HEAD>Prince Charles Bans Aerosols From Household</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said Tuesday he has banned the use of aerosols in his household because of concern that they damage the environment, and so far the only problem has been finding an alternative to hair spray. Aerosols contain chlorofluorocarbons -LRB- CFCs -RRB- which float into the stratosphere and attack the ozone layer, a 20-mile-deep belt of protective gas around the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` We are always told that it is not scientifically proved,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said. `` But I, personally, as I have become older and more autocratic, have banned the use of aerosols in my household.'' In a light-hearted reference to his wife, Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, the 39-year-old heir to the British throne added: `` Trouble still remains with finding adequate and good enough alternatives to hair spray _ as I am sure all husbands here will find.'' He spoke to representatives of businesses which won awards for improving the environment under a program organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. He said the award-winners had found solutions to environmental problems, `` so if anybody can come up with a really good answer, an alternative to hair sprays, then for God's sake do so and I will come and give the award next year.'' The environmental group Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> welcomed the prince's action, but said he did not have to ban sprays completely from his household. `` There are environmentally safe alternatives for every single kind of spray, including hair spray,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Secrett </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group. Holes in the ozone layer allow the sun's ultraviolet rays to reach the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, causing skin cancer and threatening to damage crops and alter weather patterns.

<HEAD>Court Hears Case Stemming From Police Pursuit In Detroit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was told Wednesday that police should be allowed to pursue someone who starts running at the sight of them without having any other reason to suspect a crime has been committed. `` The alternative is for the police to shrug their shoulders and let a crime occur,'' said <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solak </PERSON>, an assistant state prosecutor from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanyar </PERSON>, representing a man who started running when he spotted a police cruiser on a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> street, said, `` People run from the police for a variety of reasons.'' She said some people fear harassment, that they will be falsely accused of a crime or `` they may not like the police.'' The justices, hearing arguments in a case that could expand police power to stop people on the street, reacted skeptically to Ms. <PERSON> Stanyar </PERSON>'s assrtions. `` Do n't you think sound law enforcement would want -LRB- the police -RRB- to see what's up?'' asked Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> suggested that Ms. <PERSON> Stanyar </PERSON>'s client, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mose </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON>, initiated the chase. `` Could it be he had a guilty conscience?'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> authorities are seeking to reinstate as evidence drugs dropped by <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON>, who was standing on a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> street corner talking to another man a little after midnight on Dec. 19, 1984, when he saw the cruiser. Police said <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON> immediately started running away and they followed him in the car. After turning a corner and as the cruiser drew alongside of him, <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON> threw a number of packets to the ground and then stopped. The officers said they picked up the packets, which appeared to contain narcotics, and they then arrested Chesternut. He was charged with possessing heroin, codeine and diazapan. A judge in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> threw the case out on grounds police lacked a reasonable suspicion to pursue Chesternut and therefore seized the evidence unlawfully. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> law enforcement officials said the judge may have dismissed the case out of a concern for innocent joggers. Mrs. <PERSON> Solak </PERSON> argued Wednesday that the show of police authority which apparently prompted Chesternut to drop the packets and stop did not amount to an illegal search and seizure barred by the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. She also said that when <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON> dropped the packets he abandoned any right of privacy he had to protect them from a police search. Ms. <PERSON> Stanyar </PERSON> countered that <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON> reasonably believed he was being seized when police chased him and acted in `` an aggressive and confrontational'' manner. `` Under the circumstances, a reasonable person would feel he was not free to leave,'' she said. He was prevented from asserting `` his right to go on his way,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> previously has held that police must have a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing before stopping and questioning someone in a public place. The court also has said police must have more specific probable cause to believe a crime has been committed when arresting or detaining someone. A ruling in the case argued Wednesday is expected by July. The case is <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> vs. Chesternut, 86-1824.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying `` you ca n't win them all,'' said Wednesday he was disappointed but not surprised by finishing third in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s Republican presidential primary and fourth in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses. `` I think the result was somewhat anticipated,'' he told reporters, but `` you ca n't go everywhere.'' In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> finished behind Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trailed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary Feb. 16 after coming in third in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> caucuses Feb. 8 behind <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` We've done well out there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We've won in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> -LRB- at the convention Jan. 29-30 -RRB- and in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> -LRB- in a non-binding straw poll at caucuses Feb. 18 -RRB-. So you ca n't win them all,'' he added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is favored in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s Republican town caucuses this weekend. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` I think we have to do our best. The same is true for all these Southern states'' in the March 8 Super Tuesday balloting, which also includes primaries in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. State Sen. <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>, a leader of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> campaign, said he is `` still optimistic'' but she did not expect him to win; instead, she said, at best, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> will finish second or third in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to apologize or provide proof for suggestions that political motivations were behind the timing of reports of sexual misconduct by television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a former TV evangelist, provided no evidence to support his accusation on the timing, and declined to say who might be behind any such effort. But he claimed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign was the only one in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> engaging in `` dirty tricks.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said it was odd that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s tearful confession of sin came just two weeks before Super Tuesday. `` By sundown in the old South, I'd like to see him stand up like a Southern gentleman with a little evidence,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'd like to see an apology or proof. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to meet with supporters, and shook hands with about 100 backers at <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> airport. He said he was looking for a victory in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, which holds a non-binding presidential primary next Tuesday.

Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> offered in 1985 to sell oil to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at a discount of at least $ 650 million for 10 years if it promised not to bomb a proposed Iraqi pipeline, a Foreign Ministry official said Wednesday. But then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said the offer from <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a partner in the San Francisco-based construction and engineering company, was `` unimportant,'' the senior official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, now foreign minister, never discussed the offer with other government ministers, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The comments marked the first time <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has acknowledged any offer was made for assurances not to bomb the planned $ 1 billion pipeline, which was to have run near <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. The pipeline was never built. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, vice president for public relations for the <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the company did not make any offer to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> but that <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a Swiss financier, made it without <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>'s knowledge or consent. Another <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Donner </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> `` at no point'' in development of the pipeline project had anything to do with the handling of the oil. He said proposals submitted by the company `` did not include any specific arrangements for the handling of the oil or for the disposal of the oil once it reached the terminal.'' Asked about <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>'s disclaimers after they were made in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> believed <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> made the offer for the company. `` <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> came to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> as a representative of <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> and said he was speaking on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>,'' the official said. `` If he was not, he misrepresented himself.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday quoted sources close to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> as saying that according to <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> had said the oil sales would have to be conducted through a third party to keep the sales secret from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. The Foreign Ministry official said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> did not take the offer seriously. `` This is a man who sees 10 people every day,'' he said. `` Thirty percent of them come with crazy ideas. He just says, ` Yes, yes. We'll think about it.' That's how things work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The offer appeared to be the one mentioned in a September 1985 memo to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The memo referred to an arrangement between <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> `` to the effect that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will receive somewhere between $ 65 million and $ 70 million a year for 10 years.'' The memo from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>'s attorney, also states, `` What was also indicated to me, and which would be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly to Labor,'' a reference to the political party <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> leads The <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> memo has become the focus of an investigation into whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> knew of a possibly improper payment. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing and has denounced the memo as `` complete nonsense.'' The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a close friend of <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, relayed the offer to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> earlier in September. `` <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> thought the offer was unimportant. For him, the most important thing was to have an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil port near <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border,'' the official said `` The thinking was that this would put <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in a position where it would not be able to wage war with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, out of concern for its pipeline.'' A person answering the telephone at <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>'s Swiss residence said he was out of town and could not be reached for comment.

<HEAD>U.S. Seamen Free Whale Trapped in Fishing Nets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sailors from an American guided-missile cruiser risked their lives in a three-hour operation to free a 30-ton sperm whale tangled in fishing nets in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Tuesday. At one point, Lt. j.g <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Syvertsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wading </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, rode the back of the 40-foot mammal like `` something out of a rodeo'' while cutting the nylon cords, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> news release issued in <LOCATION> Manama </LOCATION>. He was one of four divers who went into the water to cut the nets loose in the dangerous operation Sunday. In the end, the female whale was freed and swam off, with one last piece of line dangling `` like dental floss'' between its teeth, according to Capt. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coneway </PERSON>, skipper of the cruiser Truxtun.. `` Through the ordeal the whale made no attempts to harm the swimmers It seemed that she knew they were trying to help,'' said <PERSON> Coneway </PERSON>. `` All in all it was a most unusual and rewarding way to spend a Sunday afternoon. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> would be proud.'' The rescue occurred after crewmen aboard a helicopter from the nuclear-powered carrier <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> spotted the whale floating listlessly. The helicopter was on a routine patrol and the crew dropped smoke flares to mark the spot for the Truxtun, which was 30 miles away. The two ships are part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> battle group that arrived in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> earlier this month to support naval operations in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The helicopter crewmen said they thought the whale was dead until they `` saw water spouting from its blowhole,'' according to Petty Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a rescue specialist aboard the helicopter. Rear Adm. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON>, commander of the Enterprise's escort group, ordered the Truxtun to the scene. Its crew used grappling hooks to snag the net and pull the tired animal next to the ship where they worked to remove the net. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the nylon net was a type used by fishermen in the area, but it was `` of unknown orgin.'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Michitsch </PERSON> of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, was lowered in a sling to cut the nets. When he became exhausted, he was replaced by <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Samples </PERSON> of <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. Although they appeared to have nearly freed the whale, which swam a short distance away, <PERSON> Coneway </PERSON> said he feared the animal still might not survive because of the the remaining nets and he dispatched a whaleboat to overtake it. <PERSON> Syvertsen </PERSON>, one of two volunteers, became entangled in the net for about 15 minutes, and finally was relieved by <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, a rescue swimmer from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, who finished the task. <PERSON> Coneway </PERSON> said he doubted at first his sailors would be able to free the whale from the `` tangled mess,'' but `` I completely underestimated the ingenuity, perseverance and courage of <PERSON> Truxtun </PERSON>'s swimmers and deck force.

 About 5,000 lawyers marched on Parliament on Wednesday to demand the ouster of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s top policewoman, and they vowed to continue a strike that began because police handcuffed a lawyer who allegedly rifled a woman's purse. The lawyers voted by show of hands to keep up their paralyzing boycott of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s district courts and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which has been shut since Feb. 15. The dispute also closed courts around the country Monday when an estimated 500,000 lawyers struck in sympathy for their <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> colleagues. That strike also continues. The object of their ire is <PERSON> Kiran </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedi </PERSON>, a deputy police commissioner who has a reputation for stepping on toes. She made headlines last year by arresting a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for violating curfew laws. `` The continuance of Ms. <PERSON> Kiran </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedi </PERSON> in her official position is detrimental to the interests of justice,'' the lawyers said in a petition to the government. `` She has struck a blow at the independence of the judiciary, which we will not allow, `` protest leader <PERSON> Gobinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukhoty </PERSON> told the lawyers' demonstration. Home Minister <PERSON> Buta </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> on Wednesday rejected demands to suspend Ms. <PERSON> Bedi </PERSON>, 38. The controversy began Jan. 4 when students at a college caught a man who allegedly rifled a female student's purse. He was handed over to police and taken in handcuffs to district court, where he identified himself as <PERSON> Rajesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnihotri </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> lawyer. Angry district court lawyers went on strike the following day to protest the handcuffing of a colleague and demanded the suspension of the police officers involved. On Jan. 21, striking lawyers picketed the office of Ms. <PERSON> Bedi </PERSON>, who has jurisdiction over the <LOCATION> Agnihotri </LOCATION> district, where the arrest took place. Police charged the corridors with bamboo clubs to disperse the barristers, injuring 13 lawyers. The following day, the <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> joined the strike, and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lawyers followed suit on Feb. 15. The lawyers say that Ms. <PERSON> Bedi </PERSON> was responsible for ordering police to charge them with clubs. But they underestimated her public support. More than 1,000 people demonstrated in her favor on Feb. 17. Ms. <PERSON> Bedi </PERSON> was the first female member of the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the training ground for senior officers. In the past, she has booked several senior officials and politicians for traffic violations in the Indian capital, where such minor indiscretions by the powerful are routinely ignored. Ms. <PERSON> Bedi </PERSON> has been uncharacteristically silent on the lawyers' strike and her office has refused to comment She met with lawyers on the eve of the national strike in an unsuccessful pitch to call it off. Lawyer <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Jethmalani </PERSON> said the issue goes beyond the recent handcuffing incident. `` We are against this officer because she represents an evil principle, the arrogance of the executive,'' he said. <PERSON> Jethmalani </PERSON>, considered one of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s best criminal lawyer, said the strike would cause difficulties to litigants. `` I want the people to suffer a little inconvenience. This show of solidarity will help us serve the people better,'' He said. But <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s largest daily newspaper, The <ORGANIZATION> Hindustan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, rendered a different verdict. `` The lawyers must plead guilty to the charge of having ignored their obligation to the clients and the society at large,'' it said.

During the House of Commons question-and-answer period, she declared: `` The Irish government can inquire into anything they wish, but not of course into matters north of the border.'' The Anglo-Irish accord gives <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> an advisory role in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> affairs in an effort to redress grievances of Roman Catholics in the Protestant-dominated province. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s remarks appeared likely to worsen relations, already strained by disputes that include <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s refusal to prosecute police officers involved in the shooting deaths of six unarmed Catholics in 1982. The British army also disclosed Tuesday that a soldier given life in prison for the shooting death of a Catholic in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> had been freed and returned to his regiment after serving three years. Reports that Pvt. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> was back in uniform, although not in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, provoked sharp responses from leaders of the province's <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority. <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> was convicted of fatally shooting <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, road manager of the pop group <LOCATION> Bananarama </LOCATION>, on Aug. 9, 1983. He claimed in court that he fired because riots were going on and he believed <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> was about to pull a gun. The judge found him `` deliberately untruthful.'' <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> was the first soldier sentenced to life in prison for actions in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. An army statement said <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> was 18 at the time and, `` while the army in no way condones his action, we consider the incident to have been a tragic error of judgment made by a young man in very difficult circumstances.'' The Home Office said <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> was released on a life license, a form of parole under which he can be returned to prison `` should his behavior give rise to concern.'' A security cordon ringed the town of <LOCATION> Aughnacloy </LOCATION> for McAnespie's funeral Tuesday He was buried across the border in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The Irish government sent <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON>, deputy police commissioner, to the border town of <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> to investigation McAnespie's death. Protestant politicans called the Irish inquiry unwarranted interference by a foreign government in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s affairs. <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON> supported <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. He was killed by a bullet from a British army observation tower at a checkpoint near <LOCATION> Aughnacloy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>, half a mile from the border. Relatives said he was walking to a weekly Gaelic football game and had passed through the checkpoint. Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said the soldier told interrogators the shooting was an accident. He was in military custody Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 The government on Wednesday banned political activity by 18 opposition groups, including the nation's largest anti-apartheid organization and its biggest union federation, in the most sweeping crackdown in a decade. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said the move would be seen by many government opponents as a `` declaration of war.'' Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, however, said the regulations `` will contribute to a climate of stability, peaceful coexistence, and good neighborliness among all population groups.'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s order prohibits the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which represents more than 2 million members, from any activity except bookkeeping and court action. The same order was applied to 16 other groups, covering most of the large militant black political groups in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It gives <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> the power to prohibit any organization `` from carrying on or performing any activites or acts whatsover.'' Security police notified at least nine <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> members of restrictions on their activities, which included being confined to home and prohibited from speaking publicly. <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> co-president <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumede </PERSON> was prohibited from participating in any <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> activities and banned from speaking to journalists. <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, the other co-president, was ordered confined to her home from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m., prohibited from participating in activities of the <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations, and barred from addressing meetings of more than 10 people. `` We are all peaceful organizations trying to unite the people. ... Is this the way of reform? ... We dare say the government is declaring war on the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> told reporters. She said she was n't sure if she was prohibited from speaking to the press. The 750,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions was ordered to stick to labor issues and barred from political activities, such as advocating holidays with special meaning to blacks and calling for the release of detained union members. Anti-apartheid activists had anticipated a crackdown this year, suggesting that President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government would seek to blunt criticism from the extreme right in advance of parliamentary by-elections next week. The union and several of the affected organizations said they would consider legal action to challenge the regulations. `` The government's idea of reform is to smash all effective possible political opposition in the country, no matter how peaceful and lawful, and to rule with a jackboot,'' said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his fight against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial segregation. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> appealed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western countries to intensify economic pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, saying that if they do not act, `` then <PERSON> God </PERSON> help us.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the government was `` appalled'' at the restrictive measures. `` This is a giant step backward for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, general-secretary of the trade union federation, said, `` The closing of the avenues of democratic expression will possibly lead to an escalation of civil conflict and violence. There can not be a peaceful resolution of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s crisis without freedom of expression and association, and without credible organizations which can articulate the needs and interests of the majority.' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said the groups being acted against had encouraged civil disobedience and rebellion, advocated alternative structures to replace official ones, and waged campaigns of intimidation. All the groups denied wrongdoing. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION>, groups affected by the ban include: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Azanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the largest group espousing the black consciousness philosophy pioneered by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>, the activist who died in police custody in 1977. _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has promoted a `` People's Education'' philosphy in which black communities would exercise greater control over their schools. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Detainees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors detentions and provides support for relatives of people detained without charge. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Soweto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the main anti-apartheid community group in the country's largest black township and a key factor behind the rent boycott that has persisted there for nearly two years. Others included regional and national youth and community organizations and the <ORGANIZATION> Release </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group campaigning for the release from prison of <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the main group fighting to oust <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government. Under the government's system of apartheid, the nation's 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs, and the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate schools and districts.

<HEAD>Bulgaria, Turkey Sign Protocol On Good Neighborly Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> signed a protocol on good neighborly relations Tuesday in an apparent effort to resolve their bitter dispute over <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s estimated 1 million ethnic Turks. The text of the protocol, as released by the Yugoslav state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, was a clear indication that the two feuding neighbors are determined to normalize relations after years of discord. The signing averted a clash between the two countries at the <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> foreign ministers' meeting opening here Wednesday. Earlier, sources said the <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> delegation was planning to raise the issue of the ethnic Turks, who were forced by Bulgarian authorities to adopt Bulgarian names. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. The `` Bulgarization campaign'' began in 1984 and reportedly led to violent clashes between the <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> population and Bulgarian police. It was first reported by Turkish newspapers and was later confirmed by Western diplomats and <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. Foreign ministers <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mesut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> signed the protocol at a meeting in a <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> hotel, said <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> on Tuesday for the first meeting of foreign ministers from six <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> countries. The other participants come from <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Neither the protocol nor the two ministers in news statements mentioned <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s Turkish minority, whose existence has so far not been acknowledged by Bulgarian officials in public. `` The protocol we have just signed does not solve the problems, but I am convinced that it will serve as a sound basis for seeking positive solutions to the existing problems,'' <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> as saying the protocol `` makes it possible for us to develop and settle a number of issues of our bilateral relations.'' The protocol, as reported by <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, provides for a joint working group `` with a view to finding a solution to the existing problems in bilateral relations, the area of humanitarian cooperation included.'' It said, `` Another high-level working group shall be established to determine specific measures to speed up cooperation ... in the field of economics, trade, tourism, technology, transport, communications and culture.'' Under the protocol, the two countries' foreign ministers are to make periodic visits to the other country and `` review the activities'' of the two working groups with regular political consultations between the two foreign ministries. A similar protocol between the two countries was signed in 1975.

<HEAD>Reports Spain-ETA Talks May Open Door to Cease-fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Spanish officials and leaders of the Basque separatist organization <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> established preliminary contacts in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> Tuesday that could lead to a cease-fire, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s national <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. It said the resumption of talks between the government and <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> leaders living in exile in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> might bring an end to 20 years of violence that has convulsed the three Basque provinces in northern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and spilled over into the rest of the country. Last Friday, government spokesman <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Solana </PERSON> told reporters Socialist Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> was willing to resume the talks, broken off after a Dec. 11 car bombing at a Civil Guard barracks in <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION> that killed 11 people. He said the ETA appeared to be respecting a 60-day truce it offered Jan. 28 in return for a resumption of the talks. <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION>, citing unnamed Algerian sources, said chief negotiators at the talks in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Etxebeste </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> leader, and <PERSON> Julen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elgorriaga </PERSON> representing the government. The government made no comment on the <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION> report. <PERSON> Solana </PERSON> said last week the news media `` should not expect daily updates'' on the progress of any future talks. ETA is an acronym in the Basque language that stands for Homeland and Liberty. Since taking up arms in 1968, the group has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people in its campaign for independence for the Basque area. Most of the victims were police and military officers. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> acknowledged in August that his government had made contacts with <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> in an attempt to secure a cease-fire as a basis for future talks. The government has said it is prepared to discuss when, where and how <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas will lay down their arms and possible pardons for jailed <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> members not directly involved in attacks. According to various reports, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> still seeks greater political autonomy for the Basque region that would include predominantly Basque parts of neighboring <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION> province. The <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pais </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> was expected to discuss the contacts with <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> in his annual state-of-the-nation address to Parliament Wednesday. But it reported government sources said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> probably would warn there could be breakdowns during arduous negotiations and no guarantee of success.

 Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> winner of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> caucuses, now has 60 delegates to the Republican National Convention, one fewer than Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator got all 18 of the national convention delegates from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> by winning 55 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was the only candidate to win more than 20 percent of the vote, the minimum necessary under state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rules to win any delegates. Former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> came close, but with 99 percent of the precincts reporting, he finished at 19.6 percent, just shy of the threshold. The Democratic primary in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won with 44 percent of the vote, was non-binding. Party leaders in the state say they feel an obligation to honor the voters' wishes. Nevertheless, the results must first be ratified by a statewide caucus on March 12 to have any effect on how <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s 15 pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention will be awarded. If the caucus accepts the results of the primary, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> would gain nine delegates, and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would win six. None of the other Democratic candidates on the ballot received at least 15 percent of the vote, the minimum needed under party rules to claim any delegates. Following <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on the Republican list so far is Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with 35 delegates and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> with eight. Ten are uncommitted. Those totals include delegates allocated in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. In all, 2,277 delegates will attend the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> next August, and 1,139 are needed to win the nomination. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won a straw poll taken in the Republican caucuses, but that has no binding effect on how the state's 31 GOP National Convention delegates will be allocated among the candidates. That will not be decided until <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Republicans pick 24 national convention delegates at congressional district conventions in mid-April and choose the remaining 7 delegates at the state convention in mid-June. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Democrats will have to sort their way through a mountain of paper ballots that will come in from Tuesday's precinct caucuses before the allocation of their national convention delegates can be calculated. The figures from the Tuesday night caucuses represented an informal poll of the presidential preferences of the delegates elected to attend the county conventions. That poll had no binding effect, and the county convention delegates will be expected to follow the results tallied from the separate paper ballots. State party leaders do not plan to count those ballots before March 8, under an agreement worked out with the <ORGANIZATION> national </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, which had objected to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Democrats holding their caucuses so early in the season. Democratic national delegate totals remain unchanged by Tuesday's events. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has 44.5, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has 39, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has 33, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has 10.55, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has 9.8, and 278.4 are uncommitted. Those totals include delegates allocated in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, as well as the results of an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of party leaders who automatically will hold seats as convention delegates. In all, the Democratic National Convention next July in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> will include 4,162 delegates, and 2,082 are needed to win the nomination.

 About 80,000 people joined hands to form a 42-mile link through the industrial <LOCATION> Ruhr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Tuesday to protest the loss of jobs in the steel industry, union organizers said. After spending hours forming their line, the demonstrators joined hands for about 15 minutes, according to the <ORGANIZATION> IG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metall </ORGANIZATION> labor union. Thousands of people held flares and banners calling for aid to unemployed steelworkers, while church bells pealed throughout the area. Police said they could not confirm that the human chain ran unbroken for 42 miles and they did not provide a crowd estimate. Traffic was disrupted on main roads during much of the evening. The demonstrators formed their line from the <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> steel works in <LOCATION> Duisburg-Rheinhausen </LOCATION> in the western <LOCATION> Ruhr </LOCATION> region to the Hoesch-Westfalen steel works in <LOCATION> Dortmund </LOCATION>. Tens of thousands of steel workers are scheduled to be laid off, retrained or retired early because of the expected closure of steel plants.

<HEAD>Coroner Classifies Death of Woman Whose Head Was Removed as
Homicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Injected sedatives hastened the death of an 83-year-old woman whose severed head was frozen in hopes she could someday be restored to life with a new body, officials said Wednesday in classifying the case as a homicide. The <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's office, after reviewing the results of extensive toxological tests on the tissues of <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s headless body, said she was given a lethal dose of a barbiturate shortly before her death in early December. `` The coroner has classified the death as the result of a homicide due to the administration of medicinal drugs which assisted <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s death,'' Supervising Deputy Coroner <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cupido </PERSON> said Wednesday. Those involved in the attempt to preserve Mrs. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s head for eventual resurrection denied the coroner's office charge, saying the drug was administered after she died as part of their effort to preserve the brain. The coroner's office amended its death certificate Tuesday, referring the case to the <ORGANIZATION> Riverside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, where it is now under investigation The original death certificate did not state a cause of death pending further tests. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinman </PERSON> said the tests indicated Mrs. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> was alive when the drugs were administered. The sedatives pentobarbital and secobarbital were found throughout the woman's system, including her liver, kidneys and bone marrow, and investigators concluded her body had metabolized the drugs, he said `` We think they gave it -LRB- the drug -RRB- to her before she was dead,'' <PERSON> Hinman </PERSON> said. But Mrs. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Saul </PERSON>, 48, said Wednesday the allegations of homicide were `` smear tactics'' to discredit the <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a cryonics lab here. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> is a strong supporter of the cryonics movement, which believes bodies or heads may be stored at subfreezing temperatures and then brought back to life through future advances in science. Mrs. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> had been living in a Riverside nursing home, but on Dec. 9, her physician, Dr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, determined that she was gravely ill. Based on that information, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> moved her from the home to <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said his mother was maintained there briefly on a respirator before dying Dec. 11. Her head was surgically removed soon afterward. <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> said the drug <PERSON> Nembutol </PERSON> was given to Mrs. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> after the death. Her son explained barbiturates are given immediately after death to slow damage to the brain from lack of oxygen. And another <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON>, said cardiopulmonary resuscitation was also given after death to distribute the drugs throughout her system. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said the foundation had previously explained those methods and the use of drugs in its notes regarding his mother's preservation `` Now suddenly to come up and say that they think it's homicide is kind of absurd,'' he said. `` I was there and she died of natural causes and then the procedure was started.'' But <PERSON> Cupido </PERSON> said the drugs `` expedited <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s death.'' The death certificate amendment states Mrs. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> died between Dec. 9 and Dec. 11, <PERSON> Cupido </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s death has been under investigation since the coroner's office learned of it. She died at <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION>'s lab in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, where a body and six other heads are frozen in liquid nitrogen. No doctor was present when she died, which prompted the coroner's office to investigate her death. The location of her head has been kept secret by her son and <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION> officials, despite a coroner's request to examine it. A judge earlier this month blocked the coroner from disturbing any of the frozen remains at <ORGANIZATION> Alcor </ORGANIZATION>.

 The Kremlin on Wednesday installed an Armenian as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of a disputed territory in an apparent effort to end ethnic protests in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> that a dissident said involved 200,000 people. Soviet authorities also ordered an end to the unrest. Protesters in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, want the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> turned over to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, smallest of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 15 republics. In another apparent concession, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> radio said Armenian party leaders would ask the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to discuss <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> in a meeting on nationality policy. No such meeting has been scheduled, but Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed one last week. <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> was the scene Tuesday and Wednesday of industrial strikes, school boycotts and public demonstrations said to be the largest in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 70-year history. In the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> on Wednesday, there was a rally on an national anniversary day, with demonstrators shouting `` Get the Russians out!'' according to a dissident. The demonstrations were the latest in a recent burst of ethnic conflicts in a huge nation that stretches from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and encompasses more than 100 nationalities, under a central government dominated by ethnic Russians. <PERSON> Paruyr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, an Armenian activist who spent 17 years in labor camps and internal exile for national activities, said 200,000 people gathered in the central square of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. He said in a telephone interview that they chanted `` We want a session!'' _ demanding that a special session of the republic's legislature decide whether <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> should become Armenian Western reporters could not travel to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> immediately, and telephone contact was not always possible. About 150,000 people, most of them Armenians, live in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the disputed autonomous region in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> whose 1,760 square miles make it smaller than <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. Annexation would increase <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s area by 14 percent and its population, about 3.4 million, by 4 percent. Last fall, Armenian sources said more than 2,000 ethnic Armenians marched in the region, just north of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, to protest mistreatment by <PERSON> Azeris </PERSON>, the dominant ethnic group in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>. The party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has declared <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> should remain part of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>, which caused Armenian protests and began an argument about whether the party has the right to decide such issues. In a dispatch Wednesday night, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the regional party organization named a 56-year-old Armenian, <PERSON> Genrikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Pogosyan </PERSON>, party leader in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. While <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Pogosyan </PERSON> was Armenian and born in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, it did not give the nationality of his predecessor. The surname of the former leader, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kevorkov </PERSON>, indicates he is Russian or <LOCATION> Azeri </LOCATION>. The agency also referred to a `` passive, wait-and-see attitude of the autonomous region's party and government bodies whose leadership had displayed a superficial approach to evaluating the... situation and the existing sentiments <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said party leaders plan to take all necessary steps to restore order in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, effectively declaring an end to the dispute. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> confirmed there were mass demonstrations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. He described them as peaceful and said he did not know the number of protesters. Arikyan, the Armenian activist, said protesters were angered by <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> interference in a territorial question, which he said the Soviet constitution defines as a matter for the government, not the party. In a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, he said major industries were crippled by strikes Wednesday and virtually all students at colleges and technical institutes boycotted classes. Ethnic tensions have arisen with increasing frequency over the past year as Soviets embrace <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call for `` glasnost,'' or more openness about some social problems. Another national demonstration was reported in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. Wednesday was the 70th anniversary of the establishment of an independent <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, which was annexed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Podrabinek </PERSON>, a Moscow-based dissident, said 2,500-3 ,000 people gathered at a <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> landmark and shouted `` Independence to <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>! and `` Get the Russians out!'' Plainclothes agents photographed the demonstrators and militia surrounded them, bringing in a bus with a loudspeaker that blared music and propaganda to drown out the demonstrators. No one was detained and the demonstrators dispersed after about three hours, he said. <PERSON> Podrabinek </PERSON> said he received his information from a correspondent in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> for the underground journal <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Podrabinek </PERSON> edits. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported there was an official rally in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> to protest what they considered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> provocation of nationalist activists. Street demonstrations occurred last summer in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and its neighbors <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, which were annexed at the same time. In the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, at least 3,000 people rioted Dec. 17-18, 1986, in the capital, <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, to protest appointment of an ethnic Rusian to replace a Kazakh as the republic's party leader. In a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report Tuesday, the government acknowledged the unrest in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and said it was not in the public interest. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the government believes `` things should remain as they are now'' in terms of which republic governs <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. He said he had spoken with officials in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> by telephone, but had no more information than that contained in media reports. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the government newspaper, recommended more public discussion of the dispute. It acknowledged a `` mass meeting'' of protesters in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, student boycotts and involvement of national party figures in seeking a solution. Wednesday's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda carried the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report, but no commentary on the events. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, who said he spoke from an apartment 100 yards from the protest site, said Wednesday: `` There are at least 200,000 people in front of the Opera House. I've never seen anything like it. He said two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> secretariat, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolgikh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Tuesday `` to calm the people'' in the city 1,100 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dolgikh </PERSON> addressed the protesters Tuesday, the Armenian activist said. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dolgikh </PERSON> asked the demonstrators to send a small delegation to party headquarters in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to discuss the dispute, <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Gephardt Nails Democratic Foes; Dole Heads South With Two Wins</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS day of week in lead</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> echoed a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> refrain on Wednesday, saying there is `` hardly a dime's worth of difference'' between his chief Democratic presidential rivals on economic issues. Republican Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> sought to slice into Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Southern support. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> blistered Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, while a fourth Democrat announced he would not compete in the delegate-rich round of primaries known as Super Tuesday on March 8. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, reeling after a spate of poor finishes, insisted he would remain in the race but conceded he lacked the money to compete across the South. Among the Republicans, former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> once knew the whereabouts of the American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and suggested they could have been rescued. The assertion drew a tart response from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Why did n't he tell us where they were?'' It was the second startling comment in as many days from <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. He suggested on Tuesday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign aides were behind the recent public disclosure of television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggert </PERSON>'s sexual misconduct, and said they timed the disclosure to make life difficult for another television evangelist running for president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied that charge anew, saying, `` I'd like to see an apology or proof.'' The vice president shrugged off <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s solid victories Tuesday night in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> caucuses, saying, `` You ca n't win them all.'' He made a flying tour through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where he hopes to win the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> caucuses over the weekend and the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> primary next Tuesday. But those events _ one in a state where the vice president owns a home and the other that has no bearing on the hunt for convention delegates _ drew little attention from the rest of the field. Instead, other eyes turned to Dixie, which is hosting most of the 20 Democratic and 17 Republican contests that will be held on a single day on March 8. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> with Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> at his side, and said he supports legislation on textile imports that is popular in the state. `` I recognize that I've got to catch up,'' he said. `` But we believe there is some momentum'' after his twin wins in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Even so, a fresh poll showed just how far <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has to go. The <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survey of Southern voters showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favored by 54 percent of Republicans most likely to vote on March 8, with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> favored by 33 percent. And the Dole forces said their prospects were particularly bleak in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which offers the biggest single cache of Super Tuesday delegates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was a narrower favorite in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> survey, at 26 percent, with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at 18 percent, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 16 percent, and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> at 12 percent. The poll was conducted Feb. 19-21 among 759 registered voters in 13 Southern states. But if <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s speech in <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was any indication, the fight for the region's hundreds of delegates will be intense. He said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seem committed to `` nothing more than redecorating the facade of the status quo.'' He charged that the approach both men have taken to the federal deficit problem `` invites a post-election round of income tax increases and federal cuts in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Social Security.'' `` On the central economic issues of this campaign, there is hardly a dime's worth of difference between Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. He also ridiculed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s foreign policy experience, saying it consists `` almost entirely of negotiating with the governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> over the issue of nuclear power.'' The `` dime's worth of difference'' phrase was a reminder of former <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>'s third party campaign theme of 1968, when he used it to sneer at the major party nominees. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' initial response was made by campaign aide <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>. `` We welcome a comparison of the candidates' records but first we need to know which of <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s records he's talking about,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the only candidate in this race who's balanced budgets, put people back to work and lowered taxes five times in five years.'' There was no immediate response from <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who ridiculed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> as `` two peas in a pod ... I do n't see either one of them to stand out as a principal challenger.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has based his candidacy on making a strong showing in his native South. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> announced his scaled-back campaign at a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, saying, `` There's no sense in fooling myself'' about his chances for success in the South. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he would concentrate on the primary in his home state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on March 15 and the states that follow. But without prospects for delegates from the Super Tuesday states, his chance of winning the nomination appeared non-existent. Republican also-ran <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> vowed he would stay the course, despite two more disappointing finishes in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s campaign has been victimized by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s emergence as a strong contender in the early caucus states. `` I needed to break up the idea that this is a Bush-Dole race,'' he said. `` This is no longer a Bush-Dole race.''

 The world's largest black religious organization will begin construction in March on its world center headquarters, church officials announced Wednesday. The $ 9.2 million development for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is expected to be completed in April 1989, said <PERSON> T.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jemison </PERSON>, president of the organization. More than 40,000 convention members are expected to attend dedication ceremonies two months later, he said. `` With 7.7 million members, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> has grown to the point where the leadership decided we need a central headquarters from which to manage our many missions,'' <PERSON> Jemison </PERSON> said. `` The six boards which now comprise the convention are currently located throughout the country, and to bring them all under one roof will result in a fundamental restructuring of our entire organization from which we should reap tremendous benefits,'' he said. The 75,000-square-foot building, containing a 2,000-seat chapel and crowned by a 225-foot spire, will be built on 12.5 acres near the seminary of the National Baptist Convention and the Southern Baptist Convention in downtown <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>.

 Heavy rain on Wednesday slowed the search for a kidnapped <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and forced a top <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official to postpone a helicopter flight to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to press for his release. The rain flooded citrus groves in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where Amal, the largest Shiite Moslem militia faction, and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers have searched since Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was abducted Feb. 17 near <LOCATION> Tyre </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> An Amal spokesman confirmed a report the militia captured gunmen involved in the kidnapping of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a onetime aide to former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> and leader of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers' group in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>'s successor, said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that too much was being made of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' role with the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary's office. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, responding to a question, said: `` Let me point out that Lt. Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was a lower-ranking officer in the office of the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 38 people in it. My principal military aide is a major general.'' `` Lt. Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' functions were mainly administrative. I think overly much is being made of this in the press and if I may say, I'd prefer to limit by comments to that because I think any further comment tends to encourage undesirable and unwise press speculation.'' The Amal spokesman said the detainees had not been able to provide information on the whereabouts of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> or the abduction's mastermind, who escaped. The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> has claimed it abducted <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and alleged he was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials denied the accusation. On Monday, the group released a videotaped message in which the captive recited conditions for his release _ Israeli withdrawal from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, release of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Lebanese detainees held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and suspension of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic activity in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Security sources in Tyre said the Amal search for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was continuing. `` The weather has generally been against the search campaign,'' said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Heavy rains and storms hamper the search by Amal.'' The Amal spokesman said the group arrested in the Tyre region three gunmen `` who seized Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and forced him into the first getaway car and three men who had monitored <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' movements before the abduction. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> also captured `` the man who was supposed to transport <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' he said. The seven detainees are among 42 members of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, arrested by <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> in the past week. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which is backed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, has supported <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction, calling him a `` filthy American. It claimed Amal has abducted 150 of its members. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be an umbrella group for smaller factions involved in the kidnapping of 24 other foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The kidnapped include eight other Americans. The longest-held foreign hostage is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was abducted March 16, 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> have been vying for control of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Amal spokesman said the group was `` coordinating efforts'' with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We keep <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> informed on all developments.'' The Amal spokesman said his militia group, which is headed by Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> and backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, `` supports <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> and will not permit such acts to reflect negatively on the peacekeeping force.'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> headed a 76-man <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team of observers that monitored violations of a 1949 <LOCATION> Lebanese-Israeli </LOCATION> armistice agreement along the border. The observers were attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces when the nine-nation, 5,800-man force deployed in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1978 after an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intervention. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commander, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagglund </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, told reporters Tuesday that further kidnappings of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel would `` endanger the future'' of the peacekeeping forces. He said Swedish soldiers have been ordered `` not to leave their posts or move around south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> alone.'' <PERSON> Hagglund </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> on Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> source said. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> had flown to <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> headquarters by helicopter from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, hoping to fly on to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He later returned to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, said only that `` Mr. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>'s helicopter flight to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has been postponed due to bad weather conditions.''

 An acquaintance of <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> testified Tuesday he could not link the defendant to explosives that were smuggled into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Lebanese-born <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is on trial of charges of masterminding the kidnapping of two West German businessmen in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in January 1987 in a bid to force the release of his brother, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, held as a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is also charged with smuggling liquid explosives into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for possible use in terrorist attacks. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Hage </PERSON>, an acquaintance of <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s, testified that he and his three sons helped the defendant pick up suitcases from a train station in the town of <LOCATION> Merzig </LOCATION> in mid-January 1987. But he said he did not know what was in the suitcases, nor what <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> later did with them. On Jan. 20, <PERSON> Hage </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, told the court he helped <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> pick up the suitcases and that he suspected the luggage contained explosives. Police found explosives buried in a field near <LOCATION> Merzig </LOCATION> on Jan. 27, 1987, and said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> had left them there. The 47-year-old Hage on Tuesday repeatedly denied any knowledge of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s activities.

 A disgruntled workers' compensation recipient, waving a .38 caliber handgun, held two attorneys hostage for nearly three hours in a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> office building Wednesday afternoon before quietly surrendering. No one was injured in the incident, which started at the Workers' Compensation Board around 1:15 p.m., police said. The man pulled a gun in a hearing room and grabbed the two hostages, said Detective <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McConville </PERSON>, a police spokesman. The man was holed up inside the room with his two hostages until about 3:45 p.m., when he released one of them. Fifteen minutes later, he turned the second attorney loose and surrendered to police, said police spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON>. Earlier, he had demanded that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a local television news reporter, come to the scene and had aired his grievances about his case to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. And Workers' Compensation Board Chariman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> agreed to review the case, which involved a 1984 car accident that led to a settlement in December, authorities said. The two lawyers were identified as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. Initially, police had said one of the two lawyers was an administrative law judge. One of the attorneys had represented the gunman in his workers' compensation case, said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON>, deputy police commissioner for public information `` Apparently, his grief is with the workmen's compensation board,'' <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON> had said during the incident. `` We'll wait it out.'' The gunman's only demand was to meet with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> McConville </PERSON> said. The television newsman arrived shortly before 2:30 p.m., riding in a police car with its sirens and lights on and cheered by workers in the six-story office building. The gunman complained to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> that he was being harassed over the $ 20,000 settlement in his case.

<HEAD>Workers Rescued From Sinking Oil Rig</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thirty-four oil rig workers arrived safely on land Tuesday after their platform sank into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, forcing them to flee in watertight capsules. The workers on the rig E-302, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Keyes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offshore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION>, were evacuated Monday night from the rig, 82 miles south of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, then transferred to a workboat for the trip back to <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, president of Keyes Offshore. The vessel radioed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> about 1:15 a.m. that it had picked up the workers, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> duty officer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwin </PERSON>. About three hours earlier, a distress call had been relayed to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> from the rig, <PERSON> Merwin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> rescue ships were dispatched from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Corpus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION>. The accident occurred when one of the 396-foot legs of the triangular, jack-up rig punched through the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> floor, <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> said. `` It resulted in bending the three legs on the rig,'' he said. `` The rig was about five feet above the water because we had not jacked up all the way.'' Workers had been at the site about three hours before the accident, which happened in seconds, he said. Southwesterly winds at 30 knots, causing 7 - to 10-foot waves, may have contributed to the collapse, <PERSON> Merwin </PERSON> said `` That kind of wind, though, should n't have been enough to sink a rig like that,'' <PERSON> Merwin </PERSON> said. The rig was capable of drilling 20,000 feet, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> office would investigate, he said. Company spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said the rig appeared to be salvageable.

<HEAD>Soviet Union Buys 350,000 Tons of Corn</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought 350,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery this year under a long-term agreement between the two countries, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. It was the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sale to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since last fall, although <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been buying huge quantities of wheat at subsidized prices under the department's Export Enhancement Program -LRB- EEP -RRB-. Corn is not eligible for the subsidy. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Nollmeyer </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it was the first substantial sale of corn to the Soviets since last Oct. 23 when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters reported 600,000 tons. Some small quantities were sold after that, she said. No selling prices or other information about the corn sale were disclosed. When subsidies are involved, the exporting firms, quantities and amounts of <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> payments are shown, but not when straight cash deals are involved. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> so they can sell a foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive world prices. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 350,000 tons of corn would be about 13.8 million bushels. Corn prices recently have been averaging about $ 1.82 per bushel at the farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around $ 25 million. The corn is part of the grain the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. The pact expires Sept. 30. According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought a little more than 2 million tons of corn, or just half of the minimum amount specified by the agreement. By comparison, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought more than 6.3 million tons of wheat at subsidized prices, plus 800,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal for delivery this year.

<HEAD>Delvalle May Break with Noriega, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Panamanian President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has indicated to associates that he may be ready to break his close links to military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The officials, in interviews this week, said any such move would narrow further <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s base of support and possibly hasten his demise as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s dominant political force. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration looks upon <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as the principal obstacle blocking its goal of an eventual transition to elected, civilian-led rule in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The officials, who asked not to be identified, said <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has privately expressed his intention for many weeks to distance himself from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but they recognize that such a step would require considerable courage. `` We get information from all sorts of sources, including friends and relatives, that he is about to do something along these lines,'' one official said. Congressional sources, also insisting on anonymity, said they have heard the same reports. Since last summer, the administration has been publicly encouraging <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military officers to withdraw from politics as a means of promoting a return to rule by civilians. In the meantime, much of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid program to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been suspended and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has expelled all American aid personnel. Two federal indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug trafficking charge added a new dimension to the already strained relationship. The indictments, handed down in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> earlier this month, portrayed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as a key member of an international drug-smuggling conspiracy. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, opposition to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> spans the political spectrum. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> assumed the presidency in 1985 under circumstances that strongly suggested <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had forced his predecessor, <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardito </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON>, from office. It was a constitutional succession, but <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has been widely perceived as no more than <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s titular head. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has maintained that executive authority rests with <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has achieved a full transition to democracy. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> critics are campaigning against him for the purpose of annulling the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, under which the waterway reverts to Panamanian control at the end of 1999. Attempts to obtain comment from the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s purported intentions were unsuccessful. For the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the stakes in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are extraordinarily high. The administration believes that a democratic, politically stable <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> offers the best assurance for the continued efficient operation of the canal. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials noted that challenging <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would not be an easy step for <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. They said the president's extensive business interests and his family could be threatened if he breaks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In addition, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s health is said to be tenuous because of a heart operation. However, the officials said <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has become increasingly disturbed by his ties to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and that some of his friends have rebuffed him because of that association. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> also may be tempted to act because of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s growing financial crisis. `` The country is falling apart all around him,'' said one source. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabrega </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> diplomat who resigned recently in protest over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule, said in an interview this week that the country's financial problems are so severe the government may not be able to meet its payroll next month.

<HEAD>Swaggart Penalty May Be Stiffened After Wave Of Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Assemblies of God leaders, swamped with protests that the penalty recommended for television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s moral lapses was too mild, indicated Wednesday it may be stiffened. A torrent of complaining telephone calls has poured into the denomination's headquarters here, more than 3,000 of them in the past two days. `` There's a strong sense of moral outrage at the leniency applied in this case,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, who said he got that assessment from two of the denomination's top executives. A special meeting was called for Thursday of the church's 13-member executive presbytery, which rules on such matters, to examine the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state presbytery's recommendation that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> be suspended from preaching for three months and undergo two years' rehabilitation <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, known for his harsh denunciations of sexual lapses in his worldwide TV preaching, was charged with such an offense himself, although details have not been specified. Photographs showing <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> with a prostitute reportedly were given to church officials by rival evangelist <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, who filed a $ 90 million suit charging <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> with unjustly accusing him of numerous sexual affairs. An unidentified <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> prostitute said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday night that she had had sex with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, while other reports described the case as involving `` pornographic'' activity. A suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> sheriff said Wednesday that a tattooed prostitute with an arrest record in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is believed to be the woman photographed with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> last October. Jefferson Parish Sheriff <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> told the State-Times that the 28-year-old woman was rumored to be in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Thursday. He said he has a warrant for her arrest for failure to show up for a Dec. 9 hearing on a soliciting for prostitution charge. The likelihood that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s penalty may be extended came in official word that the issue was expected to be turned back to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district, which had proposed the penalty, for reconsideration. That is the prescribed procedure under church bylaws for getting a punishment revised if it is deemed inadequate. If the matter is returned to the state district, a final decision may not come for several weeks, said <PERSON> Juleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, the denomination's information officer. Church sources also said the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district, in announcing its decision Tuesday, had violated a church bylaw that such recommendations are not to be disclosed until approved by top officials. `` It created tremendous pressures, appearing that the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district was trying to dictate its judgment,'' <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> said. It was learned that some members of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s board are on the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district council, and did not abstain from participating in the case. Asked whether the $ 12 million that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> contributes annually to the denomination might have been a factor in the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> handling of case, Ms. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said, `` It wo n't affect the decision here.'' The church's final verdict, when it comes, will be in accord with `` the seriousness of the offense,'' Ms. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said. An unwritten church precedent is that those involved in sexual offenses are barred from preaching for at least a year. `` It's never been less than a year,'' she said Ms. <PERSON> Turlage </PERSON> said a `` high percentage'' of those calling the church about the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district's proposal `` were not pleased.'' `` A lot of people are unhappy with the initial recommendation,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Champion </PERSON>, editor of the denomination's weekly, <ORGANIZATION> Pentecostal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangel </ORGANIZATION> But he added, `` Many thought it too light. Some thought it too severe.'' <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON>, pastor of 2,000-member <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assemblies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> and former district presbyter, said protests at the lightness of the sentence had come from overseas as well as across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Pastors and leaders are deeply concerned about the adverse effects on young people and church efforts to teach them moral principles,'' he said, as well as on the `` image of the church and American Christianity'' generally. `` Most pastors take their marriages seriously,'' he said, and to `` give approval to this sentence is to say we're soft on sin.'' He said some overseas leaders have demanded immediate cutting off of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s overseas broadcasts. The denomination has 2 million members nationally, and about 16 million in autonomous Assemblies churches overseas. `` Nobody is out for blood, or after <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s hide,'' <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> said. He said most want the case handled not only with compassion and forgiveness, but `` with a sense of accountability'' for conduct.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Communist official who monitors religious affairs indirectly attacked Thursday a group of Roman Catholics who organized a petition to the government signed by more than 300,000 believers. Deputy Culture Minister <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jelinek </PERSON> said `` so-called activities we have witnessed in recent days not only do not explain accurately -LRB- church problems -RRB-, but essentially damage'' their solution. <PERSON> Jelinek </PERSON> oversees church affairs in the Czech republic. The 31-point petition, said by knowledgeable religious activists to have garnered 243,000 signatures in <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION> and about 100,000 in the Czech lands, demands separation of church and state, more religious education and permission for priests and bishops to fill vacant positions in 10 dioceses. It gained support from Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> and was signed by far more people than any other document of its kind in 40 years of communist rule in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Authorities were slow to comment on the petition, which has circulated since late December. An article in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Rude Pravo last Saturday, however, attacked some points as unconstitutional, while admitting that some demands, such as the one for more bishops, were `` natural.'' In reporting <PERSON> Jelinek </PERSON>'s remarks, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> did not quote him as mentioning the petition. But the comments appeared directed at petition organizers, who have been attacked in the state-run media. <PERSON> Jelinek </PERSON> was speaking in the Moravian capital of <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION> to leaders of the government-sponsored Pacem in <LOCATION> Terris </LOCATION> group, a priests' organization not recognized by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> In <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, an official at the state office for church affairs said talks between the Communist authorities and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> on filling vacant sees will not resume for at least one month. The two sides met last month but did not report progress. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. The government favors Pacem in <LOCATION> Terris </LOCATION> candidates to fill the vacant sees. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> wants other candidates. No new bishops have been named in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> since 1973. No official statistics are kept on the number of believers in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, but church sources estimate the Roman Catholics make up about 60 percent of the 15.5 million population. Interest in Roman Catholicism and other religions in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has revived in recent years, particularly among young people. In an article Feb. 13, the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bohemian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party daily <LOCATION> Pruboj </LOCATION> attributed this to what it described as the low morals of society and suggested the new believers could not be condemned for turning to religious faith. A public show of the strength of religous belief is expected March 6 in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> during a Mass for the Blessed Agnes, a 13th-century Czech princess who became abbess of a <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> convent. She is to be made a saint later this year. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is a federal socialist republic consisting of two nations, the <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Socialist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Slovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION>.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> never approached <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to complain about proposed <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> budget cuts before <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> quit in anger, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he had heard that <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> was unhappy but said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> `` never elected to come and talk to me about it.'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> abruptly resigned Monday with a public blast at <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> for rejecting <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s proposals on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> budget, which was reduced along with budgets for the other services to meet lowered military spending totals approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> will be replaced by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a veteran <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> lobbyist for the administration. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> appeared before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to defend <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s military budget, unveiled last week, and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s decisions about how to reduce defense spending by the $ 33 billion total approved by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> late last year To meet the lowered spending goals, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said, he ordered reductions in ships, helicopters and other hardware and chose to retain spending for pay raises and training. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> pronounced himself committed to the 600-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, the fleet size set by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shortly after he took office in 1981 when the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had about 450 ships. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> ordered 16 aging frigates mothballed, which will mean that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will have 580 ships at the end of the current fiscal year. But <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also pointed out that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would be authorized to build 17 ships in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed budget. `` As most people who've worked with me know, I function with an open door,'' said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, a veteran of numerous top government jobs. He said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> `` never came to me with any protest over the budget cuts nor was I aware of his intention to resign until the letter actually landed on my desk -LRB- Monday -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was generally praised Wednesday by legislators who noted that he had a difficult job, taking office late last year at about the same time the $ 33 billion cut was ordered. Because of that reduction, the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget for the next fiscal year will be $ 299 billion. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the panel, referred to <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> and noted, `` I do n't understand where this fit of pique comes from ... If anybody's living in fat city, it's the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> the past few years We've worked toward a 600-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, that's fine, but there's nothing magic about that. He criticized <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> for what <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said was `` ill grace.'' Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stafff </ORGANIZATION>, also disputed <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s statements that the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> had opposed <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s plan to mothball the 16 frigates. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said the ships should have instead been transferred to the reserves, where they could later be returned to the active fleet. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said did n't support putting the ships into the reserve fleet. Both <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> reiterated their warnings that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security might be damaged if defense budgets are not increased. The budget `` reflects significant force structure reductions _ fewer ships, fewer aircraft, fewer weapons systems _ that have long-term implications for our national security,'' said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. He added: `` We must weigh carefully our future decisions on defense budgets and programs if we are not to reverse the substantial achievements in our military forces realized at great cost over the last seven years.''

<TEXT>
 A new `` condom for females'' pioneered in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will be tested this spring in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and its developers predicted Wednesday it would be a major weapon in the fight against AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. The new disposable contraceptive, made of polyurethane, resembles a condom but is worn by women, researchers said Wednesday as they unveiled the device. `` It takes the advantages of both the male condom and the female diaphragm and gets rid of significant disadvantages,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON>, head of the research team developing the device for <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which will market it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. But Dr. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zatuchni </PERSON>, a gynecologist with 25 years experience in researching and developing new contraceptives, said he saw the potential for `` real problems'' with the device. `` I have not seen the device nor have there been any published studies that would indicate its acceptability to couples, the effectiveness of the device in preventing pregnancy or any side-effects from using the device,'' <PERSON> Zatuchni </PERSON> said. The device, known in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a `` fem-shield'' or vaginal shield, is n't sold anywhere yet, but testing has begun in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and is scheduled to start in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in March, officials said. The contraceptive consists of a soft, loose-fitting polyurethane sheath and two flexible polyurethane rings, Ms. <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> said. One of the rings lies inside the sheath and serves as an insertion mechanism and internal anchor, fitting against the woman's cervix much like a diaphragm, she said. The other ring forms the outer edge of the sheath and remains outside the vagina. `` It is no more difficult to insert than a tampon,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Salmon </PERSON>, who helped organize tests of the device at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Middlesex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> The company, based in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said the device would provide more protection than the male condom, in part because the material is stronger than most condoms and covers a larger physical area, reducing chances of infection or exposure to body fluids. `` From a medical perspective, this product is likely to offer additional protection against sexually transmitted diseases,'' <PERSON> Salmon </PERSON> said. It also is more convenient to use than a diaphragm, Ms. <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> said, because it does n't have to be initially fitted by a doctor and can be inserted up `` six hours before the sex act or six minutes before.'' <PERSON> Zatuchni </PERSON>, a gynecology and obstetrics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the idea of a `` one-size-fits-all'' condom for women `` would be sort of ridiculous because women's anatomy varies so much.'' `` It would be hard to envision such a device staying on during the act of intercourse,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> said secure and proper fitting actually would occur during intercourse. She said the company had no estimate on how much the device would cost consumers. The `` female condom'' was developed by an group of gynecologists and obstetricians headed by Danish gynecologist Dr. <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregersen </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Bente </PERSON>. The device has been tested so far on 80 couples in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, and clinical trials are continuing in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> also plans to conduct clinical trials in 15 countries, including <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and African nations battling the spread of AIDS. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is believed to be spread mainly through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants at or before birth. Researchers wo n't have statistics on how effective the device is in preventing pregnancy or the spread of diseases like AIDS until additional studies are completed, <PERSON> Salmon </PERSON> said. The company hopes to apply to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> sometime this summer for permission to begin marketing the device commercially in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` If everything goes as planned,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> said, `` this product will be available to the consumer by the end of the year.''

 A House panel voted unanimously Wednesday to approve legislation requiring additional disclosures for increasingly popular home equity loans. The measure received the full support of the eight-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking consumer affairs subcommittee, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., including Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Similar legislation is expected to be introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the near future. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Banking consumer subcommittee, held hearings last year on the general subject of home equity loans, in which a home owner borrows money against the equity in his or her home According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Housing Markets, a research survey published by <ORGANIZATION> Lomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Nettleton </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> mortgage banking and financial services firm, the value of new second mortgages and home equity loans were to increase to more than $ 150 billion by the end of 1987. Home equity loans totaled $ 30 billion in 1981, according to the report, but topped $ 50 billion in 1984. The popularity of such loans began mushrooming when a new tax law took effect in January 1987 that limited the deductibility of interest on most consumer loans, but preserved deductions for home loans. The House bill, introduced by <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, would, among other things, put limits on a creditor's ability to terminate a home equity credit line and demand full and immediate repayment of the balance due The measure also prohibits the creditor from unilaterally changing the terms of the home equity credit line agreement and allows states leeway to provide for additional requirements. The <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group representing retail banks, savings and loans and credit unions, supported the subcommittee's action. Two major consumers organizations, <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, applauded <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> for moving the bill out of the subcommittee but criticized the panel `` for failing to correct major abuses in the HEL -LRB- home equity loan -RRB- market.'' The organizations said panel members promised to work toward changing the bill when it is considered by the full <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Meier </PERSON>, counsel for government affairs with <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the present bill `` does n't do enough to protect consumers. It does n't prohibit some fundamentally unfair contract terms. It only makes the lenders tell you about them.''

 Police found 5-week-old <PERSON> Rachael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> on Tuesday, four days after she was kidnapped by a woman answering a baby-sitter ad. The baby appeared to be in good condition, police said. `` We found found her, and we reunited her with her parents at 11:42 a.m. at the detective bureau,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernier </PERSON>. `` There were many smiles and tears throughout the investigations bureau here.''

Police said <PERSON> Maritza </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON>, a psychologist, was arrested for investigation of kidnapping. `` It appears it was a replacement baby,'' said <PERSON> Vernier </PERSON>. The suspect had a pregnancy that terminated in October, he said. He did n't say how the pregnancy ended. The child was taken from <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>'s home Friday morning by a woman who had come to the house in response to an ad for a baby sitter. The child's grandmother, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 52, asked the woman to hold the child while she answered a telephone in another room.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign manager on Wednesday heralded his second-place finish in the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> caucuses as a `` rainbow coalition'' victory and proof that the so-called electability issue is dying off. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got 20 percent of the vote in a state with a voting-age black population of 1 percent, proof that his appeal went far beyond the his traditionally strong base among blacks, said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>. `` We're thrilled about what happened yesterday,'' he said. Observers said there was evidence that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s targeting of the hard-pressed, blue collar workers may be paying off, although there were no exit polls to confirm that. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> predicted that as voting occurs in more states, people will stop talking about whether the fact that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is black means he ca n't be elected. `` I have n't heard it in a couple of weeks,'' he said of the electability issue. Opinion polls tend to support the notion that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has made some strides in his effort to reach out out to whites, although this early in the election season it is not yet clear how much of that will translate into votes across the country. `` Overall, I think he has made a slight inroad into the white vote. I do not think there's any evidence so far that it has been substantial,'' said polling associate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s polling operation Pollster <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Garin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> said the firm's polling has consistently found `` that we're looking at very different <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> than in 1984.'' `` The sense of polarization that was there four years ago really is n't there this time. There are obviously some white voters who are not open to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but the negatives and the degree of antagonism ... has really worn out over four years.'' `` For whites who are either strongly liberal or sort of feel ignored by the establishment, there is a real sense of sympathy for the things that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s been saying.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself makes a particular point of chiding white voters who think along the lines of `` I like <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, I like what he's saying _ but ...'' He told a ballroom full of receptive <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members this week that those people `` should move from ` but' to ` therefore.' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> edged out Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> for second place after the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator had banked heavily on a good showing there. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also had targeted the state _ where he got only 2.4 percent of the vote in his 1984 race _ but had spent only four days campaigning there this time around, and put only about $ 45,000 into the state, said <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. He credited much of the success to organizing by a devoted crew of volunteers. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> political analyst D.J. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support appeared strong among liberal whites and blue collar workers. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has gone after union worker support across the country, traveling to many strike locations to back them, including the <PERSON> Hormel </PERSON> strike in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` He was doing very well among working people,'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said. He said he attended a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> caucus where 44 of the 134 participants supported <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and only one of those 44 was black. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also got strong support from gays in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had drawn a capacity crowd during a campaign appearance last week at a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> church led by a lesbian pastor. In the Super Tuesday primaries on March 8, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> expects also to expand his large base of black supporters into the gay community and trade union groups, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said. Nationwide, polls show <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has his work cut out for him among white voters. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll taken last week showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was the choice of 3 percent of the white voters, and 13 percent overall. In a mid-January poll, he did better, getting 6 percent among the whites polled, said CBS News Director of Surveys <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankovic </PERSON>. However she noted the polls have also shown that he gets `` a clear measure of respect'' from whites, admiration for his leadership qualities, and a feeling that he cares strongly about their problems. In <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s adoptive home state, a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll in mid-January showed that among 507 Democratic voters, 39 percent picked him as their first or second presidential choice. The electorate is 26 percent black. Among the whites, 35 said they had a impression of him, and 37 percent reported a negative impression.

 Her mother wanted her to come home to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, but 17-year-old <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> wanted to stretch her vacation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by just one day. It turned out to be her last. `` I begged and pleaded with her to come home,'' <PERSON> Coralie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> said after learning that her daughter had been shot to death at a party in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. `` I missed her. I wanted her back. I did n't like her being there too long. I begged her to be careful.'' It was a lack of care _ or a surfeit of trust _ that led to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON>'s death Tuesday morning, according to accounts by police. Miss <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON>, a senior at <LOCATION> Rindge </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, had used the money she earned as a cashier at <PERSON> Warburton </PERSON>'s pastry shop in Harvard Square to finance the trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where she stayed with aunts in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. Detectives say she was at the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on Monday night with a 15-year-old friend, <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON>, when the two were lured away from their Boston-bound bus by a peddler of exotic fragrances. The man, who may have known <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON>, urged the girls to come to a party at his mother's house in the <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, and promised to pay their bus fare home. `` She was a good girl, but she liked to party,'' her mother said. She also said that <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> was not very streetwise. The party was in a two-bedroom apartment on the second floor of a four-story apartment building. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoecker </PERSON>, who is investigating the case, said at least seven people were at the party; one of those in attendance told <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Newsday that there were about 15. <PERSON> Stoecker </PERSON> said a few empty crack vials were found in the apartment afterward. After Miss <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> arrived, police and witnesses say, she was approached by a man who demanded to have sex with her. `` Is she for me? Is this one for me?'' the man asked, according to a witness quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. When Miss <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> refused, the man pulled out a 9mm hand-held machine gun and fired two shots into the floor, authorities said. He then forced her to undress and, as she screamed in protest, dragged her into a bedroom. The other partygoers fled in terror. `` They were fearful for their own lives,'' <PERSON> Stoecker </PERSON> said. He said the witnesses tried to telephone police, but were unable to get into an apartment building across the street. A street phone was out of order, they said. After about a half-hour, they saw the gunman, still clutching his pistol, leave the building. When they entered, they found Miss <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> dead. An autopsy Wednesday determined that she had been shot in the back, the right thigh and the left arm, according to a spokeswoman for the city Medical Examiner's office, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON>. Fluid samples were sent to a lab to determine if Miss <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> had been raped. <PERSON> Stoecker </PERSON> said police were searching Wednesday for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, 20, a convicted felon. `` He's a suspect,'' <PERSON> Stoecker </PERSON> said, although he added that `` there has n't been an official warrant yet.'' <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> served about two weeks in <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in 1986 on a misdemeanor sexual misconduct conviction, according to a spokeswoman for the city <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON>. Last June he was sentenced to three to nine years in state prison after pleading guilty to attempted robbery, according to <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> district attorney's office. Criminal court records indicate the sentencing was imposed in absentia. In any case, <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> never served the time. A spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON>, said the prison system had no record of <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said the prosecutor's records end with <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>' sentencing Ms. <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> never served time in city jail on the attempted robbery charge.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> opened fire Wednesday on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, rivals in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, saying their vague positions invite a round of income tax increases and cuts in Medicare and Social Security after the election. Echoing the rhetoric of former <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> in past presidential campaigns, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> the favorites of `` editorialists and elites'' with `` hardly a dime's worth of difference'' between them on economic issues With the crucial Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses less than two weeks away, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman, leveled his charges at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, a senator from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, who are the two he must beat March 8 to become the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> generally trails both in the polls in the Super Tuesday states. On foreign policy, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' experience `` consists almost entirely of negotiating with the governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> over the issue of nuclear power.'' On the economy, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> `` has talked more about what is wrong with the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucus than what is wrong with the national economy.'' He accused <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of having `` no budget solution at all'' and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of being off the mark by as much as $ 95 billion with his claim of the return on more aggressive pursuit of tax cheats. `` On the central economic issues of this campaign, there is hardly a dime's worth of difference between Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Senator <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said in a speech. `` The Gore-Dukakis approach is to distract the voters from those fundamental questions _ to divert the campaign to tactics or drown it in generalities. `` The Gore-Dukakis approach is worse than an evasion. It invites a post-election round of income tax increases and federal cuts in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Social Security _ which is the standard prescription of too many editorialists and elites,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` I am not their candidate. I have not been a favorite of the establishment editorialists. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is. I have not been endorsed by the neo-liberals of The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. They have endorsed <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>.'' On farm policy, trade and the idea of an oil import fee, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> contended: `` Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> talks competence; Senator <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> talks strength _ but there is nothing competent or strong -LRB- about their policies -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> were on the road campaigning Wednesday and did not have an immediate response to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s blast. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said: `` We welcome a comparison of the candidates' records but first we need to know which of <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s records he's talking about.'' <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said that `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the only candidate in this race who has balanced budgets, put people back to work and lowered taxes five times in five years.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has ridiculed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> as `` two peas in a pod. ... I do n't see either one of them to stand out as a principal challenger.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has been hitting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with ads accusing him of raising taxes in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and of making ridiculous suggestions to farmers that they should diversify with crops such as blueberries and Belgian endive. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have split early Democratic tests, while <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has focused on Super Tuesday when 20 states and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> hold primaries and caucuses _ many of them in the South. Polls across the South generally put <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> third or fourth in the field. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has usually been the leader in the Southern surveys, but a new Gallup Poll conducted last week gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the lead. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> have big campaign warchests for March 8, while <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign has been on a slimmer budget. In <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who won Tuesday's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> primary, said he does n't think <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> will have much impact on the March 8 elections. `` <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has not run and won anything in any of these races -LRB- so far -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` He pulled out of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. He ran hard in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and got not many votes. He was very active in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, probably spent more than I did and did not get many votes. I do n't see this as a Gephardt-Gore race, I think it's a Gephardt-Dukakis race.''

<HEAD>Ethics Panel To Hold Off on Biaggi Expulsion Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee has decided to hold off introducing a resolution calling for the expulsion of 10-term Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> because he is involved in litigation, according to a letter released Wednesday. The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct will not bring the matter berfore the House for a vote until `` an appropriate time can be established with Congressman <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> in order to allow for his particiaption in the floor proceedings,'' the letter said. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, is appealing his conviction on charges of accepting illegal paid vacations from an old political friend and ally. He is also due to be tried on bribery and racketeering charges in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> case starting March 7 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The ethics committee announced last week it would recommend that <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> be expelled for violating the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> code of conduct by accepting the vacations and not reporting them on his financial disclosure forms; obstructing justice; and illegally crossing state lines to accept the free trips. In a 148-page report explaining why it was recommending its most severe punishment, the 12-member committee said, `` the offenses for which Representative <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was convicted involved criminal conduct of a most serious nature going to the heart of his representational responsibilities.'' <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> has vowed to fight the expulsion resolution on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, but his spokesman, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Blancato </PERSON>, said the congressman needs time to prepare his defense.

 Here is a look at recent unrest involving some of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s more than 100 national groups: <LOCATION> ARMENIA </LOCATION> _ Police broke up a demonstration in the capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, on Oct. 18, 1987, by at least 1,000 people supporting Armenian national rights in the village of <LOCATION> Chardakhlu </LOCATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissidents. As many as 200,000 Armenians demonstrated in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> this week to demand annexation of an area of the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> called <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, witnesses report. AZERBAIDZHAN _ A clash between Azeris, the natives of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>, and long-time Armenian residents occurred in October in <LOCATION> Chardakhlu </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissidents. <LOCATION> GEORGIA </LOCATION> _ Thousands of Georgians staged an unsanctioned rally in 1979 in the capital, <LOCATION> Tblisi </LOCATION>, to protest the omission from the republic's constitution of a phrase acknowledging Georgian as the state language. About 100 people demonstrated in 1983 in the capital, <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, after the arrest of two nationalist students. <LOCATION> KAZAKZHSTAN </LOCATION> _ Up to 3,000 people rioted Dec. 17-18, 1986, in the capital, <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, to protest the appointment of an ethnic Russian to replace an ethnic Kazakh as the republic's party chief. Two people are killed, 200 injured and dozens arrested. CRIMEAN TATARS _ Members of this national group flocked to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in July 1987 and demonstrated in <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> for the right to return to their historic homeland along the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. This month, the government endorsed steps to promote the culture of the Crimean Tatars but indicated they wo n't be given privileges in their homeland, from which they were expelled in 1944. <LOCATION> LITHUANIA </LOCATION> _ Five-hundred people gathered outside a church in the capital, <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, on Aug. 23, 1987, to protest on the anniversary of the 1939 German-Soviet pact that allowed Soviet takeover of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and the other formerly independent Baltic states.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> villagers burned the home of a fellow Arab accused of helping the Israelis and lynched him after he fired on a crowd Wednesday with a submachine gun, killing a 4-year-old boy and wounding 13 people, security sources said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio called the event `` a serious escalation'' of 11 weeks of violence in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and linked it to calls by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for harsh action against collaborators. A reporter for the Arabic-language <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> newspaper <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Quds </PERSON> said residents of <LOCATION> Qabatiya </LOCATION> village accused the man of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. The reporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, identified the man as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayad </PERSON>. Palestinians began a general strike in the occupied territories Wednesday and the army reported the first attack on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers with explosives and firearms since riots began Dec. 8. The army said a bomb exploded on a road near <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> as a military vehicle passed at about 11 p.m. Tuesday and shots were fired at the soldiers, but no one was injured. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> arrives in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on Thursday to discuss a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for ending the unrest and reviving negotiations for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said hundreds of residents marched to the suspected collaborator's house in <LOCATION> Qabatiya </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and destroyed it with firebombs. Security sources said the man killed the boy and wounded the others when he fired from the house at the attackers. The national <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Ayad </PERSON> fired an Uzi submachine gun and that after the shooting, people dragged him away and hanged him. Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the report, saying the man was strung up on a utility pole. The Arab-run <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> identified the slain boy as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Qassem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Kmeil </PERSON>. An army spokesman called it a fight among Arabs and said soldiers arrived later. At least 63 Arabs have been killed by Israelis since the violence began, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Three Arabs were shot and wounded Wednesday during disturbances at the Nuserat refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, including a 9-year-old girl, hospital officials said. Several other confrontations were reported between soldiers and young Arabs throwing stones and burning tires in the streets. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s police force has been strengthened for the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit by 1,500 officers, to at least twice its normal size. The military also provided extra manpower at the request of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police, an army spokesman said. No details were available on the attack on the military vehicle. Palestinian protesters have avoided using firearms in what they call `` the uprising'' against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, confining themselves to throwing stones, bottles, and occasionally firebombs. Several knife attacks have been reported. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has said arms would not be used at this stage, but did not rule out using guns and explosives later. Escalation of the violence could prompt an even harsher military response and might cost the Arabs much of the sympathy they have won abroad. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police said about 20 Arabs were arrested in recent days on suspicion of taking part in disturbances. All Palestinians leaving <LOCATION> Silwan </LOCATION>, an Arab village inside the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> city limits, were checked and searched Wednesday. A senior police officer at the scene said: `` We are throwing the book at them: traffic violations, drug trafficking, not paying taxes. The people in <LOCATION> Silwan </LOCATION> for the last two months thought they belonged to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. We are now teaching them they live in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and they will never forget it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the human rights organization based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to conduct a thorough investigation of human rights violations. `` Sometimes soldiers have found themselves in the immediate context where some force was necessary, or maybe even gunfire was necessary, but in our view the step toward firing a combat rifle at people who are not themselves armed with firearms is a very big step to make,'' <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeo </PERSON>, head of research for <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION>, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. The general strike, called for Wednesday and Thursday by the underground `` <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> of the Uprising,'' appeared to be almost total. Few people were on the streets in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, business was at a standstill. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is likely to meet resistance in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, particularly from Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, whose right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc opposes the secretary's idea of trading land for peace. It also appeared <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will not be able to meet with Palestinians during his <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> shuttle between <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> capitals. Those invited say they will not confer with him because the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has forbidden such a meeting in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. A meeting with Palestinians is considered critical to the peace effort.

 <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be the nation's first sorority founded by lesbians, but the group's nine charter members say they started out to make friends, not history `` When you meet someone from a sorority it's almost like a built-in friendship,'' <PERSON> Marci </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>, one of the group's founders, said Wednesday. `` We just wanted something like that that we could have, kind of a way for people to meet other people.'' Officials of the sprawling <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, campus in <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION> formally recognized <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> as a campus organization last week. `` It was very validating for us,'' said sorority President <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, a junior creative writing major. University regulations forbid exclusion of heterosexuals who may want to join, and <PERSON> Krisi </PERSON> <PERSON> Burk </PERSON>, the group's spokeswoman, said <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> hopes to sign up some heterosexual women during sorority rush week next month. `` If they're comfortable with us, then we're comfortable with them,'' said the 20-year-old junior political science major. She said several heterosexual women have inquired about joining, and the group hopes to at least double its membership next month. `` I hope people do n't think our non-discriminatory policy is a paper policy because it's not,'' she said. `` I have a lot of straight friends and I'd like to see them all join.'' Several <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> members said they considered pledging traditional Greek sororities before forming their own. They said they were frightened away by stories of lesbian members who had been ostracized after their sexual preferences became known. `` Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I do n't always feel comfortable about traditional sororities,'' Ms. <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> said. Now that she's a member of her own group, she spoke excitedly as she outlined some of <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for the weeks ahead, including participation in rush week, the spring Mardi Gras carnival, homecoming and other campus activities. Also high on the agenda will be raising the money to rent a sorority house. The group now meets on campus. Ms. <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> said the sorority hopes to get more involved in political issues than most traditional Greek letter organizations, including efforts on behalf of women, gays and minorities. She said the group can also serve as a support network for its gay members. `` We've all had family problems or at least tense moments,'' she said. `` We can help each other.'' In her case, after the group went public she decided to tell her grandparents she was a lesbian `` because I was afraid someone might ... send them a letter.'' She said they took the news well. Thus far, members said, reaction to the sorority has been generally positive. `` Yesterday in one of my classes someone approached me and said he thought it was very courageous what we were doing,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>, a 25-year-old senior English major. Ms. <PERSON> Burk </PERSON> noted that one person did complain in a letter to the editor of the campus newspaper, the Daily Bruin, that if lesbians were allowed to share a sorority house it would be the same as allowing men and women to share sorority and fraternity houses. She dismissed the argument with a chuckle. `` It's not just a sexual thing, which of course everybody thinks it is,'' she said of the sorority. `` It's no more sexual than any collection of human beings.''

 A federal judge on Wednesday gave the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> until April 15 to ban the sale and commercial use of products containing an anti-termite pesticide believed to cause cancer. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberdorfer </PERSON> ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had acted illegally by allowing 197 holders of federal pesticide licenses to sell existing stocks of products containing the pesticides chlordane and heptachlor. <PERSON> Oberdorfer </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> failed to take into account whether continued sale or use of the products `` would pose any unreasonable risk to man or the environment.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> scientists have concluded that chlordane causes cancer and excessive residues remain in homes even after proper application of the chemical, which is usually injected into soil around the foundations of houses. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Velsicol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's only manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor, agreed to stop selling the chemical while it tries to find an acceptable method of applying the pesticide. But the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement with <PERSON> Velsicol </PERSON> did not cover products containing chlordane made by other companies for the retail market. EPA separately agreed to allow 197 companies that hold federal pesticide licenses to sell existing stocks of their chlordane products if they surrendered their licenses. The agency estimates these companies have 1,700 pounds of chlordane products in their stocks compared with the 110,000 pounds in <LOCATION> Velsicol </LOCATION>'s inventory. The judge found that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to permit continued sale of the products `` is arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion'' and violates the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said the judge's decision `` has really tied our hands on this one because it will actually result in the product returning to the market.'' `` If we go ahead and ban these products, they can appeal the ban,'' <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said. `` Under the law, the registrants can appeal, and while it's under appeal they can manufacture and sell'' the chemicals. `` That's the reason we went on the voluntary route,'' <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said. `` It will take two years to get rid of them. We thought we could get rid of them faster this way.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Misuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticides </ORGANIZATION>, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency can always use its emergency powers to suspend use of chlordane. `` They have assumed they have no authority to use their emergency powers, and that is certainly incorrect,'' <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. `` They have simply misused their discretionary authority in this case and refused to consider emergency suspsnsion,'' <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. `` If <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> believes that application of the regulatory standards in <LOCATION> FIFRA </LOCATION> results in extended product life and the only way to protect public health and the environment is to circumvent <LOCATION> FIFTRA </LOCATION>, they should be seeking statutory changes,'' <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. Besides the coalition, the lawsuit was brought by 10 other environmental groups and two labor unions.

 Doctors who believe any humanitarian aid to Nicaraguans must help both sides in the conflict said Wednesday they are seeking $ 20 million to set up an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hospital in the war-torn country. They want the money from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which is voting on a Democrat-sponsored aid package Thursday, but say they'll try to raise it elsewhere if necessary. The hospital proposal has been sent to congressional leaders but is not included in the Democrats' plan Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> of the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trauma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said he and Swiss Dr. <PERSON> Hansjurg </PERSON> <PERSON> Holdener </PERSON> would be willing to work for one year in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to set up the facility which they said should include three airplanes, 10 ambulances and a 150-bed hospital to treat <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION>, Contra and civilian victims. <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> described the proposal as an unprecedented offer by American doctors to help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provide humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He provided a list a dozen doctors supporting the project and said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> doctors would work in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for a salary of no more than $ 20,000 a year. `` There is no way to consider food and clothing for an army engaged in a war as humanitarian,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Orsinger </PERSON> of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, which sponsored a news conference with the doctors and endorsed their project. The council describes itself as a nonpartisan supporter of democratic political processes in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> said he resigned as an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> to work full-time on the Nicaraguan proposal. He and <PERSON> Holdener </PERSON> said they met last November with medical officials in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and toured the area where the hospital would be set up. <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> all have hospitals in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which he said are apparently open to all victims of the conflict. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospital proposal was intended to `` put the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' best foot forward in the region and express the highest ideals of medical ethics.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, an aide to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said congressional leaders had seen the doctors' proposal, but funding for it it was not included in the Democrats' $ 30.5 million Contra aid measure which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he is confident will pass. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> narrowly defeated President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal for $ 36.2 million in military and other aid to the Contras three weeks ago. The Democrats propose to give $ 14.6 million for food, clothing, medicine and shelter for the rebels and about the same amount for medical aid to Nicaraguan children who are victims of the conflict. An additional $ 1.4 million would go for aid to Miskito Indians, who ended their resistance to the Sandinista government earlier this month.

 The quintessential chanteusse, <PERSON> Liliane </PERSON> <PERSON> Montevecchi </PERSON>, has brought the songs, the movements, and all the atmosphere of the cosiest French cabaret to the off-Broadway Kaufman Theater. The petite singer, with gamin face and haircut, wins the audience before she sings a note. She wears a long-sleeve, high-neck, black minidress which almost covers her black leotard, revealing slim, shapely legs in black hose and spike heels. When she sings, her voice proves even more winning. And her jolie, unflappable air delights. Draping herself across the top of <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON>'s upright piano to sing what she calls `` New Frangles Tango,'' she says: `` This song, I have not done it yet once perfectly.'' She flubs the first line; everybody laughs, and she starts over. Miss <PERSON> Montevecchi </PERSON>'s show, `` On the <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>,'' which opened Monday night, wisely varies its mood. She dips into bittersweet regret, a mood which fits a French singer so well _ but only does it a couple of times. And she throws herself entirely into songs, but again not too often, fervently raising temperature and volume. She has a light touch with humor and exquisite timing. Introducing <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` You Do n't Know Paree,'' her voice is as beautifully inflected as any dramatic actress conveying emotion as she says, `` I have friends there. Some are still there and some are gone.'' Miss <PERSON> Montevecchi </PERSON>'s French-accented English singing has been heard here before, in `` Nine'' on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. Here, she often moves directly from one song to the next, so the audience does n't break its French enchantement with applause. Lighting by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Schissler </PERSON> is subtle and effective. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, who owns the tiny theater, with seats on two sides of the stage, is the presenter in association with <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have been asked to participate in a program that would allow their subjects to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for up to 90 days without a visa, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said Wednesday. A 1986 immigration law authorized the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to approach up to eight countries to see if they were interested in participating in a pilot project to determine if visa requirements could be waived in some cases. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> announced earlier this week that it is interested in taking part in the program, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heuven </PERSON> confirmed that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also has been asked to participate. Current rules require all visitors, except Canadians, Bahamians and some Mexicans, to obtain a visa to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The normal process is for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies to rule on visa applications and check the names against lists of people barred from entry. Visitors from some nations are required to prove they have the means and the intention to go home again. The pilot program would allow tourists and business people from the two countries to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for 90 days or less without going through that process. Among those for whom visas are required, Britons and Japanese top the list of visitors to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued nearly 1.2 million visas to citizens of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and 496,000 visas to Britons. Those two countries also are high up on the list of countries where visa applications are rarely rejected. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heuven </PERSON> said the program would not go into effect until the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> completes the installation of an automated arrival and departure system that would permit authorities to monitor people coming and going from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A completion date for the system has not been announced. Under the 1986 law, the program would permit entry by people with round-trip, non-transferable tickets, valid for a year or less and not refundable in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Carriers also would be required to certify that they will provide return transportation for the visitors. Participating countries also would have to waive visa requirements for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visitors. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> does not require visas for Americans, but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> does.

 Her mother wanted her to return home to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, but 17-year-old <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> wanted to stretch her vacation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by just one day. It turned out to be her last. `` I begged and pleaded with her to come home,'' <PERSON> Coralie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> said after learning that her daughter had been shot to death at a party in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. `` I missed her. I wanted her back. I did n't like her being there too long. I begged her to be careful.'' Miss <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON>, a high school senior in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, had used the money she earned as a cashier at <PERSON> Warburton </PERSON>'s pastry shop in Harvard Square to finance the trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where she stayed with aunts in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. Detectives say she was at the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on Monday night with a 15-year-old friend, identified only as <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON>, when the two were lured away from their Boston-bound bus by a peddler of exotic fragrances. The man, who may have known <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON>, urged the girls to go to a party at his mother's house in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, and promised to pay their bus fare home. `` She was a good girl, but she liked to party,'' her mother said. She also said that <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> was not very streetwise. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoecker </PERSON>, who is investigating the case, said at least seven people were at the party; one of those in attendance told <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Newsday that there were about 15. <PERSON> Stoecker </PERSON> said a few empty crack vials were found in the apartment afterward. After Miss <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> arrived, police and witnesses say, she was approached by a man who demanded to have sex with her. `` Is she for me? Is this one for me?'' the man asked, according to a witness quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. When Miss <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> refused, the man pulled out a 9mm hand-held machine gun and fired two shots into the floor, authorities said. He then forced her to undress and, as she screamed in protest, dragged her into a bedroom. The other partygoers fled in terror. `` They were fearful for their own lives,'' <PERSON> Stoecker </PERSON> said. He said the witnesses tried to telephone police, but were unable to get into an apartment building across the street. A street phone was out of order, they said. After about a half-hour, they saw the gunman, still clutching his pistol, leave the building. When they entered, they found Miss <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> dead. An autopsy Wednesday determined that she had been shot in the back, the right thigh and the left arm, according to a spokeswoman for the city Medical Examiner's office, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON>. Samples were sent to a lab to determine if Miss <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> had been raped. <PERSON> Stoecker </PERSON> said police were searching Wednesday for a 20-year-old man with a previous felony conviction, but no official warrant had been issued. The man spent two weeks in jail in 1986 on a misdemeanor sexual misconduct conviction, then was sentenced to three to nine years after pleading guilty to attempted robbery, officials said. Criminal court records indicate the sentencing was imposed in absentia, and prison officials said there was no record that he had served the time. At <PERSON> Warburton </PERSON>'s pastry shop, which serves soups and pastries to a clientele heavily weighted with <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> students and professors, manager <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Buschard </PERSON> recalled <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolle </PERSON> as `` a very desirable employee.'' `` I thought that she was a good worker,'' <PERSON> Buschard </PERSON> said. `` She came in on days when I was shorthanded. If I needed someone to work, she would work. ... She probably was a very popular girl in school, because she got along with everybody here at work. She seemed like a very outgoing girl. `` Everybody's pretty shaken up. It's a shock to everybody.''

 A key prosecution witness in the sedition trial of members of a white supremacist group testified under cross-examination from a defendant that he receives direct guidance from God. After the government used <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>'s testimony to implicate many of the 10 men accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the government, defendant <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> on his religious beliefs. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> testified Tuesday `` a prophet of God'' led him to settle in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, where he was annointed `` King of the Ozarks'' by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Millar </PERSON>, leader of a religious group in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> also said he has the gift of prophecy and is a descendant of the biblical King <PERSON> David </PERSON>. `` Has anyone ever suggested to you before today that you, sir, might be paranoid?'' Beam asked. `` Before today, I've heard it,'' <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said. Beam and nine others, including <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, are accused of seditious conspiracy. The 10, and four others on trial, espouse white supremacist goals or belong to white supremacist groups, the government alleges. Those four, and one of the accused conspirators, are charged with plotting to kill a federal judge and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. Two also are accused of interstate transportation of stolen money. Those charged with conspiring to overthrow the government face maximum sentences of 20 years in prison and $ 20,000 fines if convicted, while the charge of plotting to kill federal officials carries a maximum life sentence. The government contends the conspiracy involved actions to kill Jews, who were seen by the white supremacists as in charge of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> has testified that in 1983, members of an Arkansas-based religious-military group he led had participated in a murder, robberies and attempts to blow up utility facilities. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> is serving 20 years for racketeering and weapons violations committed when he led the group, called the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord. He was arrested in 1985 after a four-day standoff. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>'s group, is on death row in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> for the 1983 murder of <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION> pawn broker <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stumpp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, one of the 14 on trial here, decided to kill the pawn broker because he considered him to be `` an evil man, he was a Jew, and that he just needed to die.'' <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> also is serving a sentence of life without parole for the 1984 slaying of state Trooper <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> and others agreed in 1983 at <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, to step up activities to bring down the government and replace it with an all-white state in the Northwest. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> also has testified that defendant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, 63, of <LOCATION> Cohoctah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, gave him a 30-gallon barrel of cyanide to poison the water supplies of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to create civil unrest. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 69, of the <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> group, gave approval for the <ORGANIZATION> CSA </ORGANIZATION> to provide sanctuary to members of The Order when they were `` in trouble with the law,'' <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said. At a trial in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, more than 20 people, many of them members of The Order, were convicted of racketeering for robberies of banks and armored cars. Some of the defendants in the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> case were sentenced in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> case.

<HEAD>Fat People Get That Way Because They Burn Less Energy</HEAD>

 Overweight people often get that way because their bodies burn calories more sparingly than normal-size folks', and this difference between the fat and the lean can be seen in the first months of life, two new studies show. Together, the studies demonstrate that whether people are chubby or svelte may depend as much on how efficiently their bodies use energy as it does on what they eat. In one of the studies, researchers found that fat babies _ all of whom had overweight mothers _ were already expending less energy than other infants when they were just 3 months old. `` Low energy expenditure in infants seems to be making them become overweight,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, who directed the study. The other report found that some grownups have lower metabolic rates, or energy expenditure, than others. They need less food to keep going, and they gain weight more quickly. `` It all boils down to how much you eat and how much you expend. Some people are just unlucky enough that they ca n't eat too much,'' said a co-author of the adult study, Dr. <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogardus </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Other studies have shown that fat people often use up relatively low amounts of calories when resting But a crucial question remained: Is their metabolism low because they are fat, or are they fat because their metabolism is low? By following people over time, the new studies conclude that people get fat because their bodies are especially fuel efficient, although overeating also aggravates this problem. But when two people the same height and sex eat the same amount, it appears that one may stay trim while the other gets chubby, solely because of this difference in metabolism. `` What's being shown here is that there is some broad pattern of vulnerability to weight gain,'' commented Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are starting to get awfully close to showing that there is a set of genes'' that controls obesity. The two latest studies were published in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. In the infant study, doctors studied six babies who were born to lean mothers and 12 who were born to overweight women. They used a newly developed urine test called the doubly labeled water method to measure the infants' energy expenditure while living at home. At age 3 months, all of the babies were normal sized. But by age 1, six of the fat mothers' babies had become overweight. Total energy expenditure at 3 months was 21 percent lower in the infants who later became fat. The researchers theorize that these babies have an inherited tendency to be fat. Their bodies have a high `` set point,'' or weight goal. They try to reach this point by taking in more energy or using up less. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said she believes that the fat babies ate no more than the normal ones. So they put on weight to reach their set point by being less active. `` That would be a logical thing to do in small infants, because their food intake is largely controlled by their mothers, so they did n't have the option of going to the fridge and having another sandwich,'' she said. `` But in adults, who have the option of going to the fridge, high food intake may also contribute to the maintenance of being overweight.'' The <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> study was conducted on <ORGANIZATION> Pima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, who have a high rate of obesity. Researchers measured their energy expenditure while resting and while living for 24 hours in a small room. They found that those whose 24-hour energy expenditure was low were four times more likely than those with high metabolisms to gain over 17 pounds during the following two years. They also found that low and high metabolisms tend to run in families. `` It means that some people have to eat less than others to maintain their weight. It's like they always said, but nobody ever believed,'' said <PERSON> Bogardus </PERSON>. He said he hopes the research will help convince doctors that `` everyone who is fat is n't that way just because they are gluttonous slobs. They have something wrong.''

 Estonian nationalists shouted `` Get the Russians Out!'' in the streets of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> on Wednesday to commemorate the small Baltic nation's brief generation of independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which ended in 1940. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> noted the demonstration, the latest expression of unrest among the nation's more than 100 nationalities. The official news agency did not say how many people took part, but a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissident in touch with an Estonian journalist put the number at 2,500 to 3,000. The Associated Press could not get a telephone call through to <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, the Estonian capital, to verify the reports. Wednesday was the anniversary of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s declaration of independence in 1918. The Soviets took it back in 1940 under a secret agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Nationalists in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> had asked official permission for a demonstration Wednesday but were refused. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Podrabinek </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissident, gave this account of the day's events in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>: About 1,000 people gathered in the downtown area late in the afternoon for an official rally intended as a protest of what the government called <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> provocation of Estonian nationalists. Nationalists rallied in a <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> square Wednesday night at a monument to Estonian writer <PERSON> Antonu-Hansenu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tammsaare </PERSON>, laying flowers on it as militiamen watched. Plainclothes police photographed the protesters. An elderly man began speaking to the crowd about Estonian independence and militiamen tried to take him away, but other demonstrators intervened. The militiamen backed off and remained at a distance for the rest of the three-hour rally. Speakers shouted `` Independence to <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>!'' and `` Get the Russians Out!'' Authorities brought in a bus with a loudspeaker blaring music and official propaganda. Demonstrators were invited to hold their discussion in the warmth of nearby buildings, but most refused. No one was detained and the people remaining outside dispersed on their own. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>'s mayor, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumi </PERSON>, as saying people gathered at the monument to discuss `` the actual problems of modernity and the historic past of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lumi </PERSON> said the demonstrators were invited to go inside buildings to continue their discussion because it was cold and windy, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, and quoted him as saying: `` There occurred an improvised meeting with leading scientists of the republic, deputies of the city council. Problems of the economic development of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, national relations, ecology and the democratization of society were discussed.'' <PERSON> Podrabinek </PERSON> said his information came from a correspondent in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> for the underground weekly `` Express Chronicle,'' which <PERSON> Podrabinek </PERSON> edits. Nationalists in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> also demonstrated on Aug. 23 against the German-Soviet pact under which the Soviets annexed <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>.

His hourlong speech to about 500 Communists in the resplendent white and gold Spanish Hall of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hradcany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> displayed the same cautious conservatism that characterized <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>'s leadership for 18 years He had harsh words for the Communists who, under the leadership of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, tried in 1968 to introduce some of the reforms Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> advocates today. As head of the party's chief disciplinary body from 1968-77, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> was responsible for purging almost half a million people from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> tanks crushed the 1968 reforms. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> denied there is any need to reassess the official view of 1968 and rejected any comparison between <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s reforms and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika, or restructuring, of Communist society Without mentioning <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> by name, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said Czechoslovaks were hopeful and supportive when <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was made party leader in January 1968, but that anti-socialist forces `` frustrated the great opportunity that occurred for the solution of important problems.'' `` The healthy forces in the party and society saw this growing danger and conducted a difficult and complicated struggle against it,'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> failed to ally with these forces, and a `` tragic development'' was averted only `` thanks to the international assistance of our friends.'' Public reference to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion has been rare over the past year. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> went on to praise <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who presided over the ceremonial meeting, the first official event to mark the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover in February 1948. The Communists got almost 40 percent of the vote in elections in 1946, but assumed sole power only after a series of political maneuvers during street demonstrations from Feb.20-25, 1948. `` It was no Communist coup, as it's always described by hostile propaganda,'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said of the 1948 takeover. `` It was the will of the people.'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>' speech set off celebrations that will include a mass rally Thursday in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, scene of a triumphant speech by then <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Klement </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottwald </PERSON> on Feb. 21, 1948. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>' speech signaled that his leadership is likely to be conservative, despite official talk of economic reform. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Communists adopted the rhetoric of reform a year ago, but a much-delayed blueprint for economic changes will be published only later this week and reforms are not to be finally be implemented until 1991. Political change is scarcely mentioned. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> made clear it will not _ as in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and even the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ lead to a dialogue between Communists and unofficial opposition groups. `` The broadening of democratization in no case means the creation of space for the legalization of political opposition which, as all experiences to date show, can not be other than anti-socialist,'' he said. In announcing the imminent removal of Soviet missiles, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> hailed the move as a goodwill gesture before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> votes on ratification of the superpower arms treaty. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said removal of shorter-range SS-12 missiles from its territory would begin Thursday. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper Rude Pravo said withdrawal of SS-12s deployed here would begin in `` the next few days.'' Neither country specified how many rockets will be removed, nor how long the process will take. The announcements came one day after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> ended a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visit and talks with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said last week that SS-12s there had been dismantled and were ready for removal, but did not say then when withdrawal would begin. Under the arms control agreement signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last December in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, all intermediate and shorter-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will be scrapped within three years.

 <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s Aspirin for Children, once a leader in over-the-counter pain relief for youngsters, is slowly disappearing from medicine cabinets. The manufacture of the chewable orange tablets ended in December 1986 as <ORGANIZATION> Shering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of Madison focuses on chewable low-dosage aspirin products for adults concerned about preventing heart disease. Aspirin-free pain relievers and name-brand aspirin products competed with each other until the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION>, in a report in 1982, said giving aspirin to children suffering from chicken pox and influenza increased the risk of contracting <PERSON> Reye </PERSON>'s syndrome The illness is fatal in about 20 percent to 30 percent of the cases, and some survivors suffer permanent brain damage. The government in 1986 ordered warning labels on all aspirin bottles about the risk to children and teen-agers of contracting <PERSON> Reye </PERSON>'s syndrome The market `` dropped considerably from 1980 with the Reye's syndrome business,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which still manufactures <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION>'s Aspirin for Children `` We feel there are certain patients for whom children's aspirin is appropriate,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s Aspirin for Children, first marketed in 1949, was replaced with aspirin-free tablets called St. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s Aspirin-Free Fever Reducer. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Saberton </PERSON>, a consultant with <ORGANIZATION> Kline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that the children's aspirin market has become relatively small with sales of about $ 15 million in 1986 compared with sales of about $ 115 million for the non-aspirin pain reliever acetominophen that same year `` The risk and work involved in making aspirin is unattractive, especially since there's acetominophen,'' he said. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s Aspirin for Children and <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>'s Aspirin each had about $ 5 million in sales in 1986, with the balance of sales taken up by generic brands, he said. He also said <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s Tylenol products, which use acetominophen, cut heavily into sales of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, which once held 50 percent of the children's pain-reliever market while <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> had the other half. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Schering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plough </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said, however, that his company disputes the link of aspirin to <PERSON> Reye </PERSON>'s syndrome. `` It's been our position that there's been no scientific valid evidence to link aspirin and <PERSON> Reye </PERSON>'s syndrome,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Low </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aspirin </ORGANIZATION> was introduced last month, although the company makes no claim in relation to aspirin's effectiveness against heart disease The low dose aspirin product label advises it not be given to young children, he said. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said his company showed higher sales of <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> Children's Aspirin during 1987, although he could not say if it was due to Shering Plough leaving the market `` I think the first increase you saw was ours last year. I can not analyze why that is,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said they will start removing shorter-range <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles from their territory Thursday. <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, the Soviet defense minister, said Monday while Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that withdrawal of the SS-12s would begin this month as a `` display of goodwill.'' The weapons must be eliminated under the U.S.-Soviet treaty on intermediate-range nuclear arms signed in December, which has yet to be ratified. <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rovensky </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday: `` Under an agreement between the Czechoslovak and Soviet governments, the withdrawal of Soviet army rocket units armed with operational-tactical missiles from Czechoslovak territory will start on Feb. 25.'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the announcement. A brief announcement by the East German diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said: `` Withdrawal of the Soviet shorter-range missiles from the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> will begin on Febrary 25 -LRB- Thursday -RRB-, 1988.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> announced last week that Soviet SS-12s stationed at Waren had been dismantled, crated and prepared for return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. According to figures released after the treaty was signed, there are 54 SS-12s in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has not said how many Soviet missiles were installed on its territory, but Western analysts put the number at 39. The intermediate-range treaty requires elimination of nuclear weapons with ranges between 300 and 3,000 miles. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said missiles would be removed Thursday from <PERSON> Waren </PERSON> and another site at <LOCATION> Bischofswerda </LOCATION>. The only location ever given for the weapons in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was a military base near <LOCATION> Hranice </LOCATION>, 180 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>.

 Foreign ministers from six <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> nations meet in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> Wednesday to discuss ways of ending conflicts in the area, long troubled by regional disputes. The three-day session will be the first such conference since World War II. Military, ethnic, environmental and political disputes mar relations among the six. Ministers from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> members <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and non-aligned <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> Tuesday. At a meeting in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, on Monday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and Bulgarian leader <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> conference should be a forum for cooperation. `` We hope that this meeting will turn into an institution,'' the official Bulgarian news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> as saying in a dinner speech. He suggested that such meetings be held every two years. <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> as saying the conference first `` should discuss the questions that unite us. `` We do not underestimate the contradictions and the difficulties between the <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> states, but they must continue to be discussed on a bilateral and multilateral basis.'' Although the conference is expected to focus largely on economic, scientific and cultural cooperation, festering issues are expected to be raised. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> are likely to raise the possibility of establishing a nuclear-free zone in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>, a proposal opposed by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Turkish and Greek diplomats, however, have said they wo n't raise the dispute over <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, which is divided by forces loyal to each nation. The Yugoslav state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> has reported that <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> plans to propose a special <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> conference on environmental issues, apparently to take <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to task for pollution on the Bulgarian-Romanian border area. One potential problem apparently was resolved Tuesday when <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> signed a protocol on good neighborly relations. A Turkish diplomat had said earlier his delegation planned to raise the issue of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s ethnic Turkish minority at the conference. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s estimated 1 million ethnic Turks were forced by the government to adopt Bulgarian names as part of a `` Bulgarization campaign.'' The protocol was seen as a clear indication that the two neighbors seek to normalize relations after years of discord. Ethnic tensions also strain relations between <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, which has a large Albanian minority in the southern province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. `` There are many problems that we must review, concerning both bilateral cooperation and cooperation among the <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> countries in general, in order to create an atmosphere of confidence,'' Albanian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Reis </PERSON> <PERSON> Malile </PERSON> said in a television interview upon his arrival in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. Malile is the highest-ranking Albanian to visit <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in 40 years. <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> strongly condemned <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s decision in 1948 to break with the Soviet loc, but 20 years later <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> followed suit.

But he was sentenced in 1986 to three years in prison on charges of drug trafficking and possession. A year later he was released after Soviet authorities reviewed his case. <PERSON> Magarik </PERSON>'s release was attributed to the policy of greater political openness initiated by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` When I was released from prison I was told that I was the last of the Prisoners of Zion.

 Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> was asked Wednesday to halt rail shipments of radioactive waste from the <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear plant until a new study can be made of the route by which they are transported. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., ranking minority member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, made the request in the wake of an incident involving a <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> train in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area earlier this month <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> took the senator's request under consideration, a <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> aide said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> confirmed on Wednesday it is investigating a rail car switching incident on Feb. 9 just before a <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> train passed through <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The agency is determining whether there were violations of rail regulations, which could draw civil penalties of up to $ 10,000. The train was carrying casks of radioactive wastes from the damaged <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to a government laboratory in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the possible violations involve mislabeling of a covered hopper car, which was added to the <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> train in a railyard in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, Ill. The car carried a placard stating that it contained a flammable material, but later was found not to be carrying the dangerous cargo. <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> said the investigation is looking at possible violations by the rail switching yard, the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> which operated the train after it left the yard and a lime company that was shipping the car. Federal rail regulations, <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> said, require shippers to properly label goods being moved by rail. Regulations also prohibit switching yards from offering mislabeled cars for addition to a train and railroads from transporting any improperly labeled freight. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> met on Wednesday with <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> and several other senators from states along the <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> rail route. The Missourian wants the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to halt the waste shipments until the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> can study the rail route used by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to move the materials to the laboratory in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Since the shipments began in 1986, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> officials have complained that the government's route takes the radioactive materials through densely populated cities such as <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> has begun installing smoke detectors in crew cars as a result of a weekend fire that killed an employee, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. The installation of smoke detectors began Monday in the 15 or so double-decker cars that serve as crew sleeping quarters on long-distance trips, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The move came after a 70-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> employee died of smoke inhalation from a fire that began early Saturday in the crew car of a westbound <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zephyr </LOCATION>. Nineteen people suffered minor injuries. The fire was discovered as the train pulled into <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, about 150 miles west of here, for a scheduled stop. Some passengers complained that they were not warned about the fire, and questioned why there were no smoke detectors on the train. <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said the train crew's first priority was to rescue those in the employee car and evacuate those in a passenger sleeper. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> officials said the passengers were in no danger because the burning crew car and the passenger sleeper were detached from the coach section of the train. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> had said commercial smoke detectors were too sensitive and that the vibration of the trains would set them off. He said train fires were rare, but that <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> had been looking for a reliable smoke detector. <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said Wednesday that the newly installed smoke detectors may go off as a result of cigarette smoke or dust, but that the false alarms would be preferable to not having any alarms. The railroad also is considering installing smoke detectors in passenger sleepers, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to develop a fire and smoke alarm system for several years, and during the last six months has asked vendors for assistance, <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said. Four companies appear to have a concept that may work and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> is working with them, she said. The state fire marshal's office has blamed the fire on an electrical short in the crew car. <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> officials believe the fire may have begun when boxes of pillows placed next to a heating element in the luggage storage compartment of the crew car ignited. However, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> officials are continuing to investigate, she said. In the meantime, <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> had disconnected all heating elements in the luggage storage compartments in similar crew cars. In addition, emergency windows in the dormitory section of the cars are being expanded, she said.

 An inmate who had called eight killers to the stand as character witnesses was sentenced a second time Wednesday to die in the electric chair for the rape-murder of his 13-year-old stepniece. Judge <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Formet </PERSON> said the convicts' statements on behalf of 31-year-old <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> were believable `` but fall short of convincing this court'' to spare his life. Testifying last week under extraordinary security, the eight Death Row inmates from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison had portrayed <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> as a model prisoner, a peacemaker, teacher and generous person who should be spared execution. A jury late Saturday recommended by a 7-5 vote that the judge impose the death penalty. <PERSON> Formet </PERSON> was free to set aside the recommendation but cited <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s confession, which he later recanted, and agreed with the prosecution that the 1976 slaying of <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Driggers </PERSON> was `` heinous, atrocious and cruel.'' <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s original death sentence was overturned in April by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled the original jury in 1977 had not considered mitigating evidence of the defendant's character and background. Prosecutors <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> and <PERSON> Belvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> had denigrated the testimony of the `` eight despicable criminals.'' `` All these murderers stated their opposition to the death penalty while seeming oblivious to the fact that each had himself imposed that ultimate penalty upon innocent victims,'' the prosecutors said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> was sworn into office Thursday and promised to end decades of harsh authoritarian rule and form a `` people's government.'' It was the first peaceful transfer of power in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s violent 40-year history <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said human rights abuses and government repression would not be tolerated under the new <LOCATION> Sixth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and his administration would swiftly carry out democratic and social reforms. `` The day when freedoms and human rights could be slighted in the name of economic growth and national security has ended. The day when repressive force and torture in secret chambers were tolerated is over,'' the 55-year-old <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said in a tough speech. But <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> also warned opposition groups to work with his government and end the country's long tradition of confrontational and violent politics. He said he would not tolerate disorder. Outgoing President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, whose authoritarian government crushed opposition and imprisoned and beat dissidents, listened impassively as <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> criticized past abuses of power and said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> could accept nothing less than full democracy. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s hand-picked successor. `` There is a strong wind of change blowing over the country,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said to applause at the heavily guarded ceremony. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said the new government would ensure full democracy along with social and economic reforms to aid the poor and other disadvantaged groups. `` I declare that the new administration will be a government of the people. It will open an era of democracy in which each citizen can reach his full potential,'' he said. Then, in a warning to the opposition, he said, `` The day when confusion was irresponsibly created on the pretext of freedom and participation must also come to an end.'' Thousands of radical students staged demonstrations Wednesday to protest <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s inauguration and protesters hurling firebombs and rocks battled police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and two other cities. It was massive demonstrations led by students last summer that prompted <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> to agree to democratic reforms. He accepted the changes after <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> publicly urged him to do so. But <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general, is identified with the military-backed governments that ruled the country since 1960 and many Koreans are doubtful he can achieve widespread democratic change. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an international observer team said Wednesday that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s election appears credible despite some government abuses during nationwide voting last Dec. 16. The observers, co-sponsored by the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said `` it appears that the vast majority of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people have accepted'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s victory. Thousands of riot police and security agents guarded Thursday's ceremony attended by 25,000 invited guests in the square in front of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> building under a hazy late winter sky The general public was not admitted and the 120,000-man national police force was on nationwide alert. Army and navy bands played, trumpeters blew fanfares and a traditional Korean folk orchestra in red robes and black horsehair hats performed. Detachments of riot police stood guard in side streets as <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> rode to the inauguration ceremony. About 150 protesters remained Thursday in the compound of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Myongdong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after battling riot police in the surrounding streets during the night. Five students armed with bombs and knives briefly seized a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government building in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and detonated two bombs Wednesday before being overpowered by police. Nobody was hurt or taken hostage in the hourlong incident. Main streets of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> were decorated with the white, red and blue South Korean national flags and Thursday was declared a national holiday. Pink and blue arches proclaimed the founding of the new republic that comes into being with the adoption of a new constitution. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told this nation of 41 million people, `` Let us here and now bury regional antagonism, partisan and factional egoism and personal resentment.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won the country's first democratic presidential election in 16 years on Dec. 16 with 36.6 percent of the vote. He defeated rival opposition candidates <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, who split the opposition vote. Opposition parties contend the government will continue to be run by the armed forces and an entrenched elite of government officials and business leaders. Many Koreans reacted with dismay last week when <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> announced a new Cabinet that included seven holdovers from the Chun government. Top security posts went to right-wing hardliners. Other Koreans argue <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> must be given time to meet his promises for major reforms. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has emphasized the need for political stability and continued economic expansion as well as democratic reforms. He has stressed that security must be sufficient to ensure the 1988 Olympic Games are carried out successfully in September. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> stepped down at the end of a seven-year term.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was constrained from helping black <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> fighting the government partly because of divisions among them. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked at a news conference whether he had considered aiding the African National Congress or other groups opposing the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> government since his administration has aided guerrillas fighting oppression in other countries. `` No, we have not involved ourselves in that, other than things such as the sanctions and so forth,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We have tried our best to be persuasive in this very difficult problem.'' He was asked what the difference was between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and other countries where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is supporting `` freedom fighters.'' `` The difference is that we do n't have an armed insurrection going as we have in some other countries and we have a great division even among the people who are being oppressed,'' he said. `` It's a tribal policy more than it is a racial policy and that is one of the most difficult parts here.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had contacted the South African government earlier Wednesday to object to the government's banning of anti-apartheid organizations `` They should be working toward a multiracial democracy and not oppressing political organizations there, and we've made our feelings clear about that,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had said it was `` appalled'' by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s decision to ban political activity by the nation's largest anti-apartheid group and 17 other opposition organizations. `` By acting to outlaw non-violent political activity of these organizations, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> government has dealt a severe blow to efforts to achieve a a peaceful solution to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s problems,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said He said the affected organizations represent the aspirations of a broad cross section of the black community. `` We are appalled by the announcement from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> government today that it is effectively outlawing the activities of a large number of organizations,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, adding: `` This is a giant step backward for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> had summoned <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to register `` shock and distress'' over the crackdown.

 A federal appeals court Wednesday night granted a stay of execution to a man scheduled to die early Thursday for a murder committed at age 17. A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, in granting the indefinite stay, said it needed more time to study the case of 24-year-old <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. Earlier Wednesday, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> denied a stay. The stay came hours before <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was scheduled to die by injection for the 1981 shooting death of <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, in a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> grocery store parking lot. <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> was robbed of less than $ 100, although police said the victim had $ 6,000 on him. Defense attorney <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> had asked for a stay pending a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> case contending that people who commit crimes when under the age of 18 should not be executed. His appeal also was based on a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case contending jurors should be allowed to hear mitigating circumstances when considering punishment. Arguments in that case are scheduled before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on March 1. Five other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death row inmates have execution dates this year. Twenty-seven people have been executed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, more than in any other state, since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed states to resume use of the death penalty in 1976.

 Church bells rang Thursday and thousands of Filipinos joined hands in a `` chain for peace'' to mark the second anniversary of the ouster of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> clasped the hands of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> and Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> on Epifanio de los <LOCATION> Santos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. It was along the broad avenue, known popularly as EDSA, that hundreds of thousands of civilians rallied to support military mutineers in the uprising that forced the former president from the country on Feb. 25, 1986. As church bells pealed Thursday, a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> air force T-28 swooped low over the crowd dragging a banner reading `` People Power.'' Police estimated that by 8:30 a.m. -LRB- 7:30 p.m. Wednesday EST -RRB- about 20,000 people had packed the avenue for the all-day celebrations. Leftists scheduled their own rallies Thursday at which they planned to accuse Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of abandoning the reformist goals of the 1986 revolution. On Wednesday, about 20,000 people marched along the boulevard and burned an effigy of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. During celebrations Thursday, armored personnel carriers carried images of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> in a procession along <PERSON> Epifanio </PERSON> avenue. Officials said the images were the ones carried by priests and nuns during the 1986 revolt. Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, said in a radio broadcast that the celebrations showed `` we want brotherhood and not bloodshed.'' In 1986, <PERSON> Sin </PERSON> called on Filipinos to fill the streets to support mutineers led by <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>. They had broken with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, charging him with fraud in the Feb. 7, 1986, presidential election in which he ran against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The rebels' action galvanized the opposition that began after the 1983 assassination of opposition leader <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. During a leftist protest Wednesday, about 200 police officers blocked the road leading to the military's Camp Crame in suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as helicopters hovered above. The crowd of students, workers, farmers and Roman Catholic clergy dispersed without incident after three hours of anti-government speeches. The leftist protesters chanted `` dismantle the U.S.-Aquino regime'' and burned effigies of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Red banners said `` Advance the People's Genuine Revolution'' and one poster read: `` Cory _ Closet Dictator.'' `` We had high hopes when <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she would be the exact opposite of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. But after two years, we have no more hope that she will fulfill her promises,'' <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON>, head of the militant <ORGANIZATION> May </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> labor organization, told the rally. People distributed leaflets of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democractic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella organization of 12 Marxist groups including the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its armed wing, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Aquino government has betrayed the Filipino people's hope for fundamental changes in society after ousting <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ...,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> statement said. Also Wednesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> denied charges by the wife of a discredited navy officer that <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> was involved in a November 1986 coup attempt. `` As far as I'm concerned, General <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> has proven himself not only now but in the past, especially in his abiding by the constitution,'' she told reporters. `` He has not been any part of any coup attempt.'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> also denied the charges by <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>, wife of Capt. <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>. The plot involved killing leftist officials, installing a military junta and reducing Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the role of a figurehead.

 Foreign ministers of eight Latin American countries opened a conference Wednesday at which they will consider calling for the readmission of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> are scheduled to meet for three days in the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>. Also on the agenda are peace efforts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, British naval drills near the Falklands, the region's $ 400 billion foreign debt and increased policing of drug trafficking, said <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON>, chief secretary for the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The ministers make up what is called the Group of <ORGANIZATION> Eight </ORGANIZATION>, organized last year mainly to monitor the situation in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that a preliminary agenda for the Group of Eight meeting, drawn up by assistants to the foreign ministers, included a proposal to support <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s re-entry into the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was expelled from the organization in 1962, three years after <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> came to power. In a meeting of the eight Latin American countries' presidents last November in <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> told reporters that the leaders had agreed that the communist nation should be readmitted to the OAS. However, such a statement was not included in a final document from the meeting. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not support the readmission of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> until that country stops trying to subvert democratic rule in the hemisphere. At the <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> meeting, the Latin American ministers are considering calling for an end to the British naval maneuvers that have taken place around the <LOCATION> Falklands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the south <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> since the 1982 war between <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, according to Ms. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> invaded the islands, which it calls the <LOCATION> Malvinas </LOCATION>, but later surrendered to the British. The ministers planned to discuss a statement urging wealthy countries to fight consumption of cocaine and calling on the eight Latin American countries to work to cut production of the drug. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> are <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s three biggest cocaine-producing countries. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Abadia </PERSON>, said Wednesday his government is not discounting the possibility of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> because of the indictment on drug trafficking charges of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s armed forces. If there is an invasion, `` we wo n't have the capacity to stop it,'' <PERSON> Abadia </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration publicly called for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down following his indictment this month by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abadia </PERSON> said the charges do not constitute an attack on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but on the Panamanian military. He claimed the charges are an attempt to break the treaty under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has promised to turn the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the year 2000. When the meeting ends, the eight foreign ministers will head for <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for a series of meetings with Central American officials on the situation in their region.

 Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said Wednesday his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> once knew the whereabouts of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` and they could have been freed'' but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said if that were so `` he kept it to himself.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s comments came at an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> news conference during which he complained that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is inadequate and declared that action must be quick when Americans are taken hostage. A <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> aide said later that the former television evangelist was referring to passengers who had been taken hostage by hijackers of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` We identified in our news department at <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> the location of those hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> very shortly after they were taken, and they were in a position where they could have been rescued,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` They were in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and they could have been freed.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> did not provide specifics and did not say which hostages were involved. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, at a nationally broadcast news conference, responded to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s claim. `` It'd be very strange if he actually did have information as to the location of those hostages,'' said the president. `` Is n't it strange that no one in our administration was ever apprised of that?'' `` If he thought that he knew,'' the president said of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, `` he kept it to himself.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added that `` we have tried our best and through every kind of channel to establish their -LRB- the hostages' -RRB- whereabouts because that's the beginning of efforts to try and get them free.'' `` It's very frustrating to try and establish a location,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` But we've never let up, and we never will, in trying to obtain the freedom of all the hostages.'' After <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s deputy press secretary, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, said: `` I think what <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> said was accurate.'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, later issued a synopsis of the news report to which <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> referred. He said it involved hostages who had been taken from <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847. The synopsis said that in response to a question from <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a CBN <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent, who was not named, said the hostages, `` are in several locations in and around <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and we have also learned that maybe at least one of them, and we do not know which one, but we have been told by intelligence sources in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, that at least one may be being held in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>.'' The suspicion concerning the hostage thought to be held in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was later reported as incorrect in a subsequent news report on <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s `` 700 Club'' talk show, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Asked whether he had told the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration what he knew, the former television evangelist said, `` I broadcast it on national television; they monitor our programs virtually every day.'' Later, in an interview on <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> WGST </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the information about the hostages was obtained by a CBN-affiliated TV station in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` My reporters in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> had information, initially, on where these hostages were taken,'' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said that was `` several years ago, when the first hostages were taken.'' Rival Republican candidate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> called <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s statements irresponsible and said he should `` apologize to the families of the hostages whom he has needlessly hurt in an attempt to gain publicity. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was asked about <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s statements. `` My question would be, how come he did n't get hold of the proper authorities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government that were working day and night, trying to figure out how they could get these people out?'' In his news conference, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said action to rescue hostages `` has to be quick and it has to be a surprise, that once the situation has hardened, six months have gone by, eight months, a year, it's virtually impossible to get any movement because the hostages are dispersed and the captors are more or less dug in.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that in 1985, `` during the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 crisis,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashem </PERSON> `` had information from sources where the hostages were being held in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and who was holding them.'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contacted <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> for information at that time, but he said he did not know exactly who made the contact. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> terrorism expert said he was puzzled by the contention. The official, who commented only on condition of remaining anonymous, said he was unaware that <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> ever broadcast the precise locations of any hostages. He also said knowledge of hostages' whereabouts in terms of a particular city or even a section of a city would n't be enough to mount a rescue mission Nine Americans are in captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who was captured last week. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held captive, having been kidnapped on March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s comments on the hostages marked the second time in two weeks that his statements on international matters have sparked controversy. During a Republican presidential debate on Feb. 14, he alleged that the Soviets have nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, pointing to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration denied it. In yet another controversy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to apologize or provide proof to back up his suggestion on Tuesday that anti-Robertson political motivations were behind the timing of public allegations of sexual misconduct against television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` By sundown in the old South, I'd like to see him stand up like a Southern gentleman with a little evidence,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'd like to see an apology or proof.

<HEAD>Federal Agents Make Arrests in Wildlife Sting</HEAD>

 Federal agents Wednesday arrested 17 people, most of them in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and were looking for seven more in the windup of a four-year sting operation aimed at illegal bear hunting. Nineteen search warrants were executed in 12 states and trophies and animal parts were seized at some locations. Five airplanes were seized at <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, but no arrests were made there. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavin </PERSON>, chief of law enforcement for the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference, `` We may have 30 to 35 people charged eventually.'' Arrest warrants were obtained for two people in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, four in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, four in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and 11 in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, a total of 22. Twelve people in fact were arrested in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and an additional suspect was being sought, but officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did not immediately know where. Agents established a kind of hunters' brokerage in <LOCATION> Purcellville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, about 50 miles from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, that arranged hunts for customers, bringing guides and hunters together. <PERSON> Bavin </PERSON> said the company, <ORGANIZATION> Abrams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outfitters </ORGANIZATION>, spent a year establishing its cover through advertisments, attendance of employees at conventions and visits to guides. The investigation began with a focus on out-of-season and airborne hunting of caribou and brown bears in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, but grew to include illegal killing of black bears, frequently in and near <LOCATION> Shenandoah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and sale of bear parts. <PERSON> Bavin </PERSON> displayed a mounted, stuffed bear he said was taken in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> by a two-plane party that landed the hunters at a makeshift camp to kill the bear as it was driven toward them by the other airplane. `` This is totally illegal,'' he said. Appearing with federal officials at the news conference, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, chief of law enforcement for the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Game and <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> was delighted to take part'' because it appeared that as many as 200 black bears were killed illegally last year out of a population of 2,000 to 2,500. In legal hunting, 557 bears were killed in the state. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bavin </PERSON> displayed about a dozen bear gall bladders, wrapped in plastic bags, that had been seized in one arrest earlier in the day. These organs are considered valuable medicine in the Far East and may bring $ 300 each. In addition, hides brought up to $ 250 each. The forest-dwelling black bear was found in 49 states 200 years ago, but practically decimated by the early part of this century. Conservation programs have restored the bear to 30 states, and hunting is often permitted. Federal law makes it a crime to transport across state lines widlife taken in violation of state law. That statute says violations can bring a year in prison and a $ 10,000 fine unless a sale across state lines is involved, in which case the term may be five years and the fine $ 20,000. Under a 1984 law, the fine may be multiplied to $ 250,000. A 1971 law makes it a federal crime to shoot or harass wildlife from aircraft, with penalties specified as a possible yearlong prison term and fine of $ 5,000. The 1984 statute makes it possible to multiply the fine to $ 100,000.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday night `` we've never let up and we never will'' in efforts to free the American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, adding that if Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> knew of their whereabouts, it was `` very strange'' that `` he kept it to himself. In his first full-dress news conference in four months, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said he thought outside terrorists had been at work stirring up the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> violence on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> that has prompted an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military crackdown. The president said he had `` every confidence'' in the personal integrity of embattled Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. But said he could not comment on reports of the investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s role in a proposed <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> oil pipeline As is his custom, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opened the nationally televised session in the White House East Room with a quip. `` On the networks at last,'' he said in a wry reference to the refusal by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> to carry his prime-time Feb. 2 speech on the eve of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote on aid to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The news conference blended international affairs with the domestic presidential campaign swirling outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gates, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> showed his zest for political combat with a few jabs at the field of Democratic contenders. To hear them, he said, `` we're in an economic slump'' suffering from a variety of ills. `` At the moment none of those things are true,'' he said. `` So I just think, you know, the kids will play,'' he said as laughter filled the room. The president also confirmed anew that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed reservations during the Iran-Contra affair. But he refused to say precisely what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had told him. On other topics, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: _ Said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had given him an `` encouraging'' report on his just-completed trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> During the talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> set a one-month deadline for arms negotiators to complete drafts on key elements of a new treaty to curb strategic nuclear weapons. _ Noted that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was embarking on a fresh peace-seeking mission to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and said he hoped Israelis and Arabs would `` rid themselves of old ideas and stances that can not work'' and begin serious negotiations _ Issued a fresh condemnation of the leftist Sandinista government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had doubled military assistance to the nation in the first two months of this year over 1987 levels He provided no figures. _ Said he had not decided whether to tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that aid should be resumed to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> He has to certify that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is helping in anti-drug efforts, but Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader, has been indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug-trafficking charges <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> passed up several invitations to criticize <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> action against Arab protesters on the occipied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` We do n't support that sort of thing,'' was as strong a statement as the president would make, but he added quickly that there was evidence that the riots that provoked an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military crackdown were not `` spontaneous.'' Asked to elaborate, he said, `` We have had information that there have been certain people suspected of being terrorists, outsiders coming in and stirring up the trouble in those areas.'' He ducked a request for more information, replying that to say more would `` get into areas that violate security.'' The subject of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> _ nearly three years in captivity _ and the other American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> arose early in the 30-minute nationally televised question-and-answer session. `` We've never let up and we never will in trying to bring freedom for all our hostages,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Asked about <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s claim that his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> had once known the location of some of the hostages and the administration may have missed a chance for a rescue, the president said: `` I can only say this. It would be very strange if he did have information ... is n't it strange that no one in our administration was apprised of it.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he did n't want to become involved in the campaign to succeed him in the White House, but he said, `` If he felt that he -LRB- <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> -RRB- knew he kept it to himself.'' The president's statement on the Contras seemed to be a soft appeal for support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for fresh aid to the rebels. He noted with regret that the Democratic-run <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had rejected his call for $ 36.2 million in fresh aid to the Contra, including some money for weapons. House leaders have scheduled a vote for next week on an alternative support calling for humanitarian aid. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was unclear on a number of points. For example, he said that Soviet membershin | | nt on Tariffs and Trade, is under review but he failed to point out that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> strenuously opposes He also said that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> did not object to the secret sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on grounds that it was a trade of arms for hostages. However, the secretaries have said otherwise, and the Iran-Contra report issued by two congressional committees said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> `` called it a straight arms-for-hostages deal that was contrary to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public policy.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> jockeyed a busy round of talks on foreign policy problems Wednesday with last-minute preparations for the news conference, the 42nd in his seven years as president but his first since last Oct. 22. His first appointment Wednesday was with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who returned from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Tuesday night after talks on arms control and the likelihood of a Soviet pullout of military forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> headed out again Wednesday night, this time to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to try to spark <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace talks. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in advance he had only a slim chance of succeeding, and that the two sides would have to moderate their `` extreme positions.'' During the talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> set a one-month deadline for arms negotiators to complete drafts on key elements of a new treaty to curb strategic nuclear weapons.

<HEAD>Archbishop Agrees to Mediate Talks With Rebels, Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Roman Catholic prelate of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> offered Wednesday to mediate peace talks between the government of President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> and leftist guerrillas who have waged a sporadic war since 1960. Monsignor <PERSON> Prospero </PERSON> <PERSON> Penados </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrio </PERSON> told reporters he accepted a request to act as mediator from the general command of the <ORGANIZATION> Guatemalan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which is made up of three leftist armies. There was no immediate comment from the president's office. The archbishop told at a news conference, `` We would carry out our mediation at any place, whether it be proposed by the guerrillas or by the government, since the important thing is to end the fratricidal fight that ... has served to blind useful lives.'' He said the first round of talks should be held before Holy Week at the end of March. The talks would be held in accordance with a <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan signed last August by the presidents of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Asked about the talks, Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said the army `` is very close to achieving a total victory'' over the rebels. `` In a very short time,'' he said, `` the subversive activity in the country will be ended.'' He said the guerrillas number 500 to 700. Last October, representatives of the government and the guerrillas met for the first time since the rebels took to the hills in 1960 after a failed coup attempt. Their four-day talks were held in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The talks foundered over the role of the army, how to interpret the term `` cease-fire,'' and rebel concern over whether the government can control rightist death squads. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> said then that further peace talks would be pointless and called on the rebels to `` become part of the country's political and productive framework once again.'' The request to the archbishop to negotiate new talks was made by leaders of the three rebel armies in the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Guerrilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> of the Poor; <PERSON> Gaspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilom </PERSON>, a pseudonym for <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Asturias </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Monsanto </PERSON> of the Rebel Armed Forces. In ads in local newspapers, the guerrillas said a dialogue with the government `` is the only way to avoid death and suffering.'' <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, the defense minister, said the rebels should put down their arms and rejoin public life before any talks are undertaken. He said <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> was complying fully with the new peace plan. The plan calls for cease-fire talks between the government and rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as a first step toward democratic elections. It also urges political amnesties and a ban on all outside military assistance to rebel groups. Right-wing death squads have operated for the past decade in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, kidnapping and killing labor leaders, suspected communist leaders and human rights activists.

 An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb exploded in central <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> late Wednesday night, killing two part-time soldiers of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> and wounding two others and a civilian pedestrian, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility in a telephoned statement to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> news organizations. <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police headquarters said in a statement that the explosion occurred at security gates in Royal Avenue. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the blast was heard more than 12 miles away. Police estimated the size of the bomb at 150 pounds. The explosion shattered shop and office windows hundreds of yards away. The police statement said the four soldiers were on patrol in a Land Rover. It said police believe the bomb was hidden behind an advertising billboard fronting a building site. Police earlier said they believed the bomb was thrown by hand but later amended this, saying they thought the bombers detonated it from some distance away using a control wire. The vehicle was stationary at the time. One soldier died almost instantly. The other died later in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, police said. They said a 57-year-old pedestrian passing by was slightly hurt. The army said the two wounded soldiers received only minor injuries. Chief Inspector <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police said the attack occurred about 11 p.m. when few people were around. The locally recruited <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> is part of the British army. Wednesday's death brings to at least 2,628 <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s overall toll since sectarian and political violence flared in 1969 The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> wants to drive the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> under socialist rule. Earlier Wednesday, police charged an 18-year-old British soldier with unlawfully killing an unarmed Roman Catholic civilian. A magistrate in <LOCATION> Cookstown </LOCATION>, 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, ordered Pvt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> held in police custody until his appearance at a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> court on March 9. The defense said <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> will plead innocent to the charge of unlawfully killing <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnespie </PERSON>, 23. He was hit Sunday by a bullet fired from an army observation post at a checkpoint near <LOCATION> Auchnacloy </LOCATION>, half a mile from the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s border. The Irish government angered <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> by launching its own police investigation. Anglo-Irish relations have also been strained by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s refusal to prosecute police officers involved in shooting to death six unarmed Catholics in 1982 British and Irish leaders Wednesday held their first meeting since October under the auspices of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gave <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> an advisory role in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> affairs in an effort to redress grievances of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s foreign affairs minister, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenihan </PERSON>, met with <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the top British official in the province. After the meeting, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said they had arranged for their police chiefs to meet next month to discuss security cooperation along the border. But the Irish government later denied that the two sides agreed on such a meeting. A joint communique issued after Wednesday's talks focused on proposed British legislation aimed at guaranteeing a fair division of employment between Catholics and Protestants in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, police in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> said they had uncovered a cache of weapons, including 30 Soviet-made Kalashnikov semi-automatic rifles, in a makeshift bunker beaneath a shed at Malahide in the city's northern outskirts. Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the weapons apparently were destined for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and may have been part of four shipments they believe were smuggled from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> over the last three years. The cache included a dozen rocket warheads, 64 hand grenades, 30,000 bullets and 500 pounds of explosives.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday night the administration has information that suspected terrorists from the outside have been stirring up trouble in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made his statement in a nationally televised news conference as Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> headed for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> with admittedly little chance of setting up <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations. Reporting on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' mission, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, it's time for all parties to rid themselves of old ideas and stances that can not work and to begin a serious process of negotiation and reconciliation.'' He was not specific, however, and he passed up several invitations to criticize <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> action against <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protesters in the occupied territories. `` We have spoken to the government there and we have also spoken to the Palestinian leadership because there is every evidence that these riots are not just spontaneous and home grown,'' the president said. Asked about the Israeli actions against Palestinian protesters, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` We do n't support that sort of thing and we are trying to persuade all the participants to try to arrive at a solution representing justice for all.'' When he was asked to whom he was referring in his statement about the riots not being `` home grown,'' the president responded, `` We have had information that there have been certain people suspected of being terrorists, outsiders coming in, not only with weapons, but stirring up and encouraging the trouble in those areas.'' `` Now, that is n't something you can go out and say we absolutely know, but certainly the violence is both ways,'' the president said. He said he could not be more specific `` because I get into areas there that would be violating security rules, and I do n't think I should.'' On a related subject, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked about reports out of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> might be willing to accept two <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions, which he has scorned in the past and which are the cornerstone of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION>. `` Well, I know that this is one other thing we're pursuing,'' the president said. `` If he really is, and if he is willing to acknowledge the right of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to exist as a nation ... I'm sure that the secretary of state will be _ is apprised of that fact, and will see what we can do there.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his administration would continue to seek ways to alleviate Israeli-Arab conflict. `` That's a goal that I think would ... be one of the greatest achievements of this administration, if before I leave, we could bring about a peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' he said. Before departing for <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> added <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to his itinerary despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against a country the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has condemned as a supporter of terrorism. `` When we have an issue to address we're going to address it in the most effective way we can,'' department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. He called <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> `` one of the key players in the region.'' Sources in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would visit on Saturday. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> refused to provide a specific itinerary, saying only that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would make stops in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and that he `` was ready to meet with Palestinians.'' He will remain in the region until next Tuesday when he flies to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to see King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, who is in the British capital for dental work, and then to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> for a summit meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is leaving his schedule open for a return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> next Thursday for a few more days of diplomacy before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on March 6. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> rates his chances of setting up negotiations as slim, and said succcess would depend on the Israelis and Arabs moderating their `` extree positions.'' At a news conference Tuesday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, he said `` it's just possible attitudes have shifted enough.'' `` Looking forward to it?'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> joshed. `` It's going to be tough.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal is to find a way for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a mixed delegation of Jordanians and Palestinians to hold negotiations to lower tensions on the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Temporary self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live under Israeli control is the short-term aim.

<HEAD>Second Scandal In Row Leaves Denomination Stunned, Questioning</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lively Pentecostal denomination, shattered by the successive shaming of its two most dazzling TV evangelists, this week was in a state of trauma. Some of its leaders were questioning the propriety of television preaching itself. `` There's a great deal of sadness, shock and grief over the whole situation,'' said <PERSON> Juleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, communications officer for the Assemblies of God, based in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. `` We're back in the shades of 1987,'' she added, referring to when the sexual lapses struck in the case of ex-TV star <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, and now had hit fiery TV preacher <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` It's a tremendous shock, so totally out of character with what he preached,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, president of the denomination's <ORGANIZATION> Evangel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's going to have a very, very serious effect on those ministries that are still on television. The element of suspicion of it is going to become even more acute.'' Some think that may be a good idea. Clinical psychologist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, a denominational member, says there is `` something corrupting about the power'' of dominating huge crowds. `` There's a kind of narcissistic evil that attracts people to that kind of work, all the self-aggrandizement it gives them. TV gives it even larger magnitude.'' He suggests local congregations should teach people to be more critical in viewing TV preachers and particularly to guard against these dangerous tendencies: _ `` Putting anyone up on a pedestal, or believing they're virtually the voice of God _ `` Ministers who put down other religions and people and who are extremely judgmental about the faults of others.'' He said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> seemed to fit these categories, almost mesmerizing crowds with his sizzling, emotional fervor and his blistering attacks on other religions and on other people's sexual flaws. `` Nobody has all the answers, and for anyone to act as if they do is a big danger sign,'' <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said. Noting that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> sometimes said anyone who disagreed with him was wrong, <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> added: `` Anyone who sets himself up with that kind of authority, that he's always absolutely correct, is a dangerous thing, and hardly to be trusted.'' However, he said `` it's unfortunately true'' that the typical kind of followers <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> attracts `` are the most gullible.'' Religion Professor <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, an Assemblies scholar of <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, said the fall of such high-powered evangelists as <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> serves this clear warning: `` We must be careful not to label as gold everything that glitters.'' Such celebrated preachers `` still have feet of clay,'' <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> said. `` People have to show greater discernment about them, recognizing that we're not dealing with God here but humans who can fall.'' Even in the scandals, he said, `` I would hope people will not drool over it, but learn from it, and look for a silver lining.'' For one thing, he added, `` people who have supported TV ministries may now put their support back in local churches and synagogues, where it has been missing in many cases.'' A noted church communications expert, the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fore </PERSON>, maintains that religion, when it buys into television, is co-opted by it and becomes a victim to its focus on self-gratification and quick-fix answers. It `` maximizes self-interest,'' he said in his recent book, `` Television and Religion,'' grossly twisting the biblical emphasis on selfless service. `` This corruption of the fundamental biblical concept of conscience into self-interest is perhaps the most serious of all the electronic church's distortions.'' <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said there is `` nothing wrong'' with the medium of television itself, but that it does involve detachment from the local congregation, `` where there is a greater degree of accountability.'' `` In television, there's not that closeness, of a minister living among his people,'' <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said. Furthermore, he added, other aspects of TV raise the `` posibility of distortion,'' such as TV's continual concern of `` what it will look like,'' and how a `` program will go over'' with a mass, theologically uninformed audience. He said that when someone in that situation has been very successful, there's a tendency `` to live in an unreal world, filled only with people who are saying what they think he wants to hear. `` It's an artificial environment that distorts the whole perspective and can lead to a point of assuming you're stronger than you really are ... that ` what might bother other people does not affect me'.'' But despite the deflecting aspects, he said, `` a person has to be of the compromising type to cross over the line'' in his morals, something <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was `` definitely not'' in his words. His conduct turned out to be something else. That, <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said, `` is part of the tremendous shock.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Champion </PERSON>, editor of the denomination's weekly, <ORGANIZATION> Pentecostal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangel </ORGANIZATION>, said church leaders `` are going through a personal trauma. Here was this brother in Christ, and suddenly this happens, and we have to deal with the fallout.''

<HEAD>Age of Corporate Chiefs Is Falling</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People who attempt to determine just what is going on in the executive suite are eyeing a vital statistic that appears to have changed direction again: The average age at which chief executive officers are appointed to lead top corporations is declining again after a fairly steady rise since the mid - and late 1960s The changing numbers are likely to prompt a spate of explanations, along with interpretations about the consequences for management and the economy. But, says one authority, they could signify only a tendency of herd behavior. Professor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> finds that in each five-year period from 1950 through 1969 the average age of newly appointed chief executives fell, from 57.7 in 1950-1954 to 50.1 in 1965-1969. After that, the age at appointment rose steadily again, reaching 56.7 years in the 1980-1984 period. But, he advises, it is now on the way down again, and he projects it will be down to 52 years or less in the 1989-1994 period. Such patterns obviously invite economic and political interpretations, but <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> cautions against reading too much into them. It may be, he speculates, that it simply `` becomes proper, smart.'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a pioneer in the study of executive mobility, has been observing corporations since 1949 and has written the book, so to speak, on the upward, sideways and downward patterns in the fortunes of high-ranking executives. His basic studies, `` The Mobile Manager'' and `` Routes to the Executive Suite,'' have educated graduate students, helped executives understand where they fit in the larger scheme and guided executive recruiters. In studying the numbers, the professor _ he teaches business at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> when he is n't offering confidential advise to chiefs _ found two curious, telling splits, or indications of bimodality, in the age groupings. These splits occurred in 1965-1969 and 1980-1984, and in each instance led to changes in the pattern. When the age level fell to 50.1 years in the earlier period it hardly represented uniformity. Instead, 33 percent of the appointments were below age 47 and 35 percent were above 52 years. That bimodality, says <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, was a turning point. Thereafter, the average age of appointment began rising again, reaching a top in 1980-1984. But then that old bimodality came into play again. In the latter period, the split found by <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> was made up of 36 percent below age 50 and 37 percent above age 55. And just as the split back in the 1960s led to a change in direction of the age pattern, this one did also. Following the latest split, the average age fell sharply in the 1985-1987 period to 54.6 years. And, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> speculates, it should continue falling right into the 1990s. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> recalls that in the 1960s, when he was well into a career of advising corporations about their own behavior, he had little difficulty in selling the idea that a chief executive was good for five years. The notion then, he explains, was to seek optimum power from the executive staff. `` Get them at their peak, utilize them and get another.'' Companies were growing. `` You did n't want to block the movement of cream to the top,'' he said. There was a strong belief in the system, in `` this is the way we do things at this company.'' Executives were there to manage within the system, not necessarily to lead. Eventually, however, that attitude changed and the age pattern rose, accompanied by a feeling that a good chairman was hard to find and so you kept him or her for 10 to 15 years. The feeling developed that if age plugged up the movement of cream to the top, then so be it. `` Those who left because the plug was stuck in the neck of the bottle were felt to detract less from the organization than the continued contribution of a well-seasoned chief,'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. The new bimodality began showing up as early as 1982, and says <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, probably indicates less belief in the system's strength. In fact, there is a suspicion that the whole system is probably faulty and needs changing. This split, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> says, suggests the feeling has developed in some corporations that people are needed at the helm who are n't so enamored with the system that they would n't dare to change it. `` If my speculation is correct,'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> says, `` we have two or three years during which corporate systems will continue to be rebuilt.'' By younger chief executive officers.

 You would n't think <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> would need a makeover to be `` Perfect People'' _ until you saw them in makeup for the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> movie. King, a chiseled, matinee-idol type, spent more than two hours in makeup every morning to look like a middle-aged, overweight, out-of-shape couch potato. The same for <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, a former fashion model. In `` Perfect People,'' which <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will telecast Monday, the couple take a good look at themselves and their lifestyle and decide to change. `` When I read the script, I said this is great but it would be physically impossible for me to play this role,'' said King. `` After they did a transformation on me and took pictures, nobody recognized me except my daughter, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>. She knew me instantly. `` I'd walk around in makeup and in the fat suit and see how people reacted to me. I had thinning hair, bags under my eyes, jowls. I also spent some time watching fat people to see how they moved. I also stole from <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bray </PERSON>, one of my co-stars on ` Riptide.' He's thin, but he has a lot of mannerisms and gestures. I called him up and said I was going to use some of them.'' The movie follows <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> and Barbie? -RRB- as they work to regain their lost youth. `` Everything we do is possible,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` The plastic surgery, the hair transplants, the implants, the liposuction. But I hope that we make it very clear that it's potentially dangerous, painful and takes a long time. So the differences between the way we looked in the beginning and the way we look at the end can be done. `` Our approach is humorous. We show how they want to look as they did 20 years earlier and the problems it causes. They're no longer grounded in reality. If you can change your appearance, what's real? They were high school sweethearts. It bothers <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> that men are now ogling at his wife. It shows that you do n't fall in love with someone for their looks. You fall in love with someone for what they are. It's really a sweet little movie about two good people.'' King calls it a nice change from his role as `` a terrible person'' in the miniseries, `` I'll Take Manhattan.'' `` I'm getting older and more of my life shows on my face,'' he said. `` That makes it better for me as an actor. I can be cast in different parts.'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said he was most excited about a pilot for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> he will do with <PERSON> Dorian </PERSON> <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON>, with whom he has been friends since they did the TV movie `` Foster and <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON>'' in 1975 about two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> policemen killed in an ambush in 1972. The projected series was developed from an idea by <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, and her friend, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoven </PERSON> The working title is `` Black and White.'' `` We're not cops,'' said King. `` We're half-brothers. Our mother has left us only one thing, an investigative newspaper. The only way we can keep it going is to work together. There's a lot of rivalry and dissention between us. Hopefully, it'll have the humor of ` The Rockford Files.' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> used to call his show an hour-long smile. `` We're two brothers who've had no contact with each other, although we knew about each other. Our mother had had two marriages and two separate lives. If would be great if we could do something with this. People talk all the time about doing something together, but they never do. So, here are two friends who got an idea and decided to do something with it.'' Away from work, he continues to work on his motorcycle collection. He has eight motorcycles and two sidecars. `` It's like owning a fine painting,'' he said. `` If you buy good stuff you'll never lose a penny. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Leno </PERSON>'s got really beautiful stuff.

 The news lately has been anything but comforting for people getting ready to file their tax returns for 1987. When the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> made test queries in the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s telephone assistant program for taxpayers, it says it got wrong answers 39 percent of the time. When Money magazine asked 50 professional preparers to compute the taxes owed by a hypothetical family, no two came up with the same number. And the preparers' fees ranged from $ 187 to $ 2,500. A person might conclude from this that the annual exercise of reckoning up with Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> is becoming a high stakes game played under very uncertain rules. If you ca n't rely totally on the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>'s own people for guidance, and if the professionals appear to be taking no more than educated guesses, to whom should you turn for guidance? Even for middle-income taxpayers, a lot rides on the answer to that question. You do n't want inadvertently to pay a bigger tax bill than you have to _ but at the same time, you do n't want to venture into territory that invites an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> audit. And the value of, say, a $ 500 tax saving pales if it costs you $ 600 in preparation fees to get it. The whole situation is certainly troublesome, but it need not be cause for panic. As Money magazine describes it, the `` financial profile'' of its theoretical family was more complicated than most people in the real world are likely to have. The tax reform law that contributed so much to all this confusion also made it possible for larger numbers of Americans to file using short forms. Furthermore, there have been gray areas for many years in the black and white of the income tax forms. Though many people complain about this, few have been eager to give up their favorite deductions and credits to the cause of `` simplification.'' Even in the present turmoil, many people relish the challenge of tackling the tax forms on their own. They reason that it is about the only chance they get to work for aftertax pay, since a refund is n't taxable income. If you prefer to let somebody else do the work, there are ways to improve your chances of coming out in good shape. First of all, says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an assistant professor of accounting at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, it's important to figure out what kind of help you need If you determine that your situation is pretty simple, for instance, you do n't want to choose a high-priced preparer who specializes in dealing with top corporate executives or rock stars. If you're not sure whether your case is simple or complicated, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> suggests asking for a meeting with a preparer simply to evaluate the degree of service you need. `` Get organized as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says. `` If your preparer has to spend time sorting through your records, your bill may be higher. `` Organized records reduce the chance that an error will occur,'' he adds. Another incentive not to put the business off until the April 15 deadline approaches: That is precisely the time when preparers are the busiest and most in demand. `` Some firms lower their fees for clients who come in early or who are willing to have their return filing date extended,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> observes. Should you find that you need continuing and fairly elaborate tax help, it makes sense to seek out a preparer the way you would a family dentist, doctor or lawyer. As <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> concludes: `` You may establish a long-term relationship that will save tax dollars for years to come.''

 The minister basked in glory, so exalted that special choirs of women sang praises to him. Born poor, he had become rich and famous. When he preached, people sighed and waved handkerchiefs in admiration. But he tumbled into obloquy. That happened to a third-century <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> bishop, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Samosata </PERSON>, dethroned as a heretic, a story recalled as resembling the fall of modern TV-famed evangelists, including the latest, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` There's nothing new in this _ it's as old as the hills,'' says <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, professor of religion at <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, but TV makes it a spectacle for millions. `` The higher the pedestal, the heavier the winds,'' <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The higher they get up the mountain, the thicker the fog. ` It's harder for them to reflect on themselves and see who they really are. With people constantly telling them how wonderful they are, that they're the ` man of God for this hour,' it's not a position to be in if one wants to be honest with himself.'' It's the old egocentric problem, as old as the biblical <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> who sought to be God himself, but <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> said the glorified are especially vulnerable. `` This is a common strand that runs through all religious literature,'' he said. As Second Samuel 1:25 puts it, `` How the mighty are fallen.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s fall, over reported involvement with a prostitute, is particularly stark because of his `` hard-line preaching,'' <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> said. `` He had preached against almost everything imaginable, and then for him to do the very thing he preached against makes it all the more dramatic,'' <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, a scholar of the Assemblies of God, the denomination to which <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> belongs, said some ministers go wrong in every century, and in every denomination `` virtually every day.'' But <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who lashed out at sexual lapses, becomes `` the epitome of hyprocrisy,'' <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> said. `` I do appreciate that he came out with it.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Champion </PERSON>, editor of the denomination's weekly, <ORGANIZATION> Pentecostal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangel </ORGANIZATION>, said that when `` people surround themselves with those who always agree, who tell them only good things, they get tripped up in public adulation. `` Ego takes over, and gets out of control. They see evil as something in other people, and rationalize their own behavior ... With somebody like <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, it a very visible thing.'' Clinical psychgologist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said that without being specific about <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, his case seemed to fit the category of someone who has `` difficulty accepting his own humanness. `` While he is so vocal attacking other people's sexual sins, he is guilty of some of that himself and struggling with it, but he feels as if he has to be above it, and so he hides it. `` He comes across as very judgmental and critical of other people. He ca n't accept his his own vulnerability to sin, so what he has to do is hide it in a kind of self-righteous hypocrisy.'' <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, who also belongs to the Assemblies of God, said that many times those who are the `` most judgmental, putting down others and condemning, are guilty of the same thing they're haranguing about. `` But they have to hide it, that's the shame, they're so afraid to deal with it.'' That kind of `` ego is a tremendous burden to carry around,'' <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s preaching often was bigoted and absolutist, condemning other religions as well as other people. `` That was his downfall,'' <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said. He noted <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had been `` very, very vocal'' in condemning preachers caught in sex scandals, including fallen TV evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> evangelist <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> admitted to his congregation Sunday he had been involved in sin after <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> reportedly supplied church officials with pictures of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> at a motel with a prostitute. <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said the highly judgmental types have a `` kind of omnipotence that ` I can get away with things,' that ` I'm above it all,' above the rules, but it finally catches up with them. `` He had pushed himself and was most successful, but he had faults and inferiorities that he was hiding and running from. That is n't healthy or mature, and it finally is self-defeating.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, president of the denomination's <ORGANIZATION> Evangel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, said the `` eminently successful'' tend to live in an `` unreal world, filled with people who say only what they think'' is wanted. `` It become unreal, an artificial environment, that distorts the whole perspective, and leads a person to the point of assuming he's stronger than he really is ... He's lulled to the place he thinks that ` what bothers other people does n't bother me'. End Adv for Fri AMs, Feb. 26

<TEXT>
 At age 65, native Texan <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON> is a big, friendly, drawling former coach, educator and inventor turned businessman, rancher, historian, author and dreamer. His dream was to make a film based on the battle of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>. That dream is coming true. With blazing cannons and bloody sabres, the heroes of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> relive on a giant new screen this week the fateful 13-day siege that inspired <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to win its independence from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1836. A black-tie premiere of the docudrama is set for Saturday. Entitled `` Alamo ... The Price of Freedom,'' the 45-minute film is an account of the battle based largely on the research and books of <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON>, and it has stirred some controversy. Academy Award-winning filmmaker <PERSON> Kieth </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> directed the movie, part of a $ 7.2 million project that includes a new IMAX theater with its 84 -LCB- - foot wide, six-story high screen The 426-seat theater is housed in the new Rivercenter Mall, which overlooks the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> grounds. The IMAX system is designed to give viewers visually stunning images as well as a sense of participation in the on-screen activity. `` The Price of Freedom'' was filmed last summer at <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Brackettville </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> built the set for his epic 1960 film, `` The Alamo.'' Saturday's premiere benefits the research library operated by the Daughters of the Republic of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and includes a reception and dinner-dance and remarks by <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> will be on hand the next day for formal dedication ceremonies, which coincide with the 152nd anniversary of the fall of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> to Mexican Gen. <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>. `` There are two great symbols of freedom in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON> said. `` First is the Statue of Liberty. But it is just that _ a symbol of freedom. Then there is this old stone mission, the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, a shrine to the price of freedom. `` And there is a difference between a symbol of freedom and a price of freedom.'' A veteran of World War II and the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> conflict, <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON> pointed out gently that a lot of people are willing to live for a cause but only a very few are willing to die for one. `` The defenders of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> were willing to die for freedom,'' he said. `` And more than 3 million people from all over the world came to the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> last year to pay homage to those 189 brave men who gave their lives that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> might be free.'' <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON> once stood outside the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> for days asking visitors if they would pay to see an authentic movie of the historic battle and if they were familiar with IMAX theaters. He liked the answers. And the premiere this weekend showcases the results of that private poll. While stressing the importance of authenticity, <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON> points out quickly that much of what occurred at the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> is subject to speculation and individual interpretation. `` There are no chronicles of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> and what happened there,'' he said. Still, <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON> spent 12 years researching his books. His travels took him to <LOCATION> Goliad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION>, Washington-on-the-Brazos and other battle sites and to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> to visit the hometowns of the most famous defenders of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>: Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonham </PERSON>. <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON> also describes the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> contribution of the Tejanos, the nine Mexicans who supported the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cause. He and his colleagues say they have made their movie as historically accurate as possible without sacrificing dramatic and entertainment value. `` If we were going to make a movie for several generations, I did not want it to be fiction,'' <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON> said. The movie has no stars but uses 450 members of war-enactment societies across the country who are dedicated to historical accuracy, costume and customs. <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON> was surprised and dismayed when <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Councilman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and a group of residents accused the producers of distorting historical facts. After viewing a rough cut of the movie, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> complained that the film demeaned Hispanics by making them look like bad guys, and presented a list of objections to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cavalcade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the production group headed by <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena-Sosa </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Cavalcade, said some objectionable scenes were deleted in the final editing from 73 minutes to 45 minutes, but professed to be puzzled by the criticism. `` In a community that's 54 percent Hispanic,'' she said, `` we're not going to make a movie that's offensive to Hispanics. Born and raised in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON> got his first exposure to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> history in a two-room, two-teacher schoolhouse in a tiny hamlet near Commerce. He interrupted his collegiate studies at <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> in 1942 to enlist in the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, but returned after the war to get a master's degree in math. His minor was history. During an academic career that was interrupted when he was recalled to active duty in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1950, <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON> was a dean at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in Big Spring, as well as chairman of the math department, coach of the track team and an amateur inventor. In 1955, with $ 150, he founded a company called <ORGANIZATION> GAMCO </ORGANIZATION> to create and build teaching aids for math students, including a classroom computer and an electronic teaching machine. The sale of <ORGANIZATION> GAMCO </ORGANIZATION> in 1966 made him a millionaire. It also freed him to pursue his ranching and writing interests and to devote more time to historical research. His first novel, `` Nothing is Forever,'' was based on the early life of <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>. That book evolved into a second novel, `` A Time to Love ... A Time to Die.'' This led in turn to `` Alamo ... The Price of Freedom,'' a non-fiction book which <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON> describes as `` history as I view it and my personal research reveals it.'' For <PERSON> McAlister </PERSON>, `` The Price of Freedom'' is more than a movie or a business venture. Said he: `` I would like to leave a legacy on the screen that retells the story of this sacrifice for freedom ... that demonstrates to a new generation that freedom is n't free ... that liberty rests finally on those willing to die for it.''

After a 20-day shuttle between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> reported early this month `` virtual agreement'' on the timetable of the Soviet withdrawal. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> still would prefer to give the Soviets less than 10 months to leave. In almost six years of negotiations, accords have been reached on mutual non-interference, on superpower guarantees that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will be non-aligned, and on the return of 3.5 million Afghans sheltered by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> _ the largest concentration of refugees in the world. But crucial aspects are still unresolved. The major issues: _ At what stage is the aid to the guerrillas to be cut off <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> hinted in a Feb. 8 statement the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support is no longer a problem. But <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> officials have said the timing of the cutoff has not yet been determined. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplies reportedly totaled $ 670 million in 1987. The supplies funneled through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> include shoulder-fired Stinger missiles said to have downed more than 200 Soviet and Afghan aircraft. _ How should the withdrawal be phased <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said a `` relatively greater portion'' of the Soviet forces will be withdrawn rapidly. But a diplomatic source close to the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were still `` very different approaches'' to the pace of the withdrawal. _ Will the settlement involve <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, host to another 2 million Afghan refugees and base for other Moslem resistance groups pressing for a non-Marxist Islamic government <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has refused to join in the talks but says it will accept any settlement satisfying the `` legitimate aspirations'' of the Afghan people. The most difficult question, however, is outside the scope of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks: Who will sign for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and what government will be installed in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> during the withdrawal? <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> argues that a durable settlement requires the prior formation of a `` broad-based'' interim government to prevent more bloodshed and assure the refugees' safe return. President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ul-Haq </PERSON> said in an interview in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> last month that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would not sign any settlement with the present Marxist government headed by President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> does not recognize <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government and insists the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks be conducted in an indirect fashion, with <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> acting as go-between. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> reportedly would like to see an interim coalition in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, including the anti-Marxist guerrillas, Afghan exiles and some representatives of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who assured a visiting <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in December 1986 that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would not abandon him, says the makeup of the future government is an internal matter and `` none of our business.'' Still, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to seek some guarantee to prevent a bloodbath during or after the troop withdrawal. Otherwise, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and members of his government, as well as departing Soviets, could be left defenseless against reprisal killings. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> shares a long border with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and there has been no indication whether the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> will be willing to relinquish any attempt to influence events in the country once the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is withdrawn. Most of the Pakistan-based groups representing the estimated 200,000 Moslem guerrillas fighting the Soviets and the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government's army of about 50,000 have ruled out any power-sharing with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. Last week, the guerrillas announced plans for a 28-member transitional Cabinet to replace <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government and sign the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> settlement on behalf of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` if the terms are deemed acceptable.'' The insurgents vowed they would not lay down their arms until an Islamic government was established. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio reported that <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> insisted a new government should be formed after the Soviet forces withdraw and the composition of a new government is a matter for `` Afghans alone.'' At the same time, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is trying to win allies in its push for an intersion would be similar to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal that was narrowly killed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> three weeks ago, but would exclude any money for new weapons. It would retain the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> as delivery agent for the supplies, and would give President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the right to seek a new vote on a weapons package after May 1. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, called the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal `` the most workable kind of program'' and one that will provide `` balanced incentives'' for the Contras and the leftist Sandinista government to pursue peace talks called for in a regional accord. The package was unveiled late Tuesday by Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., after two weeks of intensive negotiations among several factions of the chamber's majority party It went before the Rules Committee today, where Republicans were expected to demand the right to offer their own alternative. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not immediately react to the Democrats' package His own $ 36.2 million aid proposal for the rebels, including weapons, was narrowly rejected by the House three weeks ago. Among major elements in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal: _ About $ 3.6 million a month for the Contras: half to buy food, clothing, medicine and shelter, and the other half to pay for delivery of the supplies to rebel troops inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> The aid would run from March 1, after current aid expires, until June 30. It could continue until the end of the year if a cease-fire is reached by June 30. _ About $ 1.4 million for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Miskito Indians, an opposition group that has been carrying out its own battle against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, but has consistently refused invitations to join with the Contras The Indians already have worked out their own cease-fire with the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> regime. _ A new $ 14 million `` Children's Survival Fund,'' to provide medical help for children on all sides of the conflict The aid would be administered by `` non-political'' private aid groups or international relief agencies already working in the region. Not included in the package was any long-term economic development aid for the region, but a Democratic fact sheet said `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will welcome proposals'' from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on that subject. Current aid to the rebels expires Feb. 29, and with it the legal authority for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to continue air drops of previously stockpiled weapons and ammunition. The new package contains no such authority. Under the new proposal, the Contras' `` humanitarian'' supplies would be delivered by private contractors supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> until the Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are able to agree on a cease-fire. The deliveries would be monitored by the congressional intelligence committees and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm, to ensure that no weapons were included. After fighting stops, responsibility for delivery would shift to a private aid group or an international relief agency such as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The package also would provide for an expedited procedure for a vote on new military aid for the rebels _ a high priority for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration _ if a cease-fire should fall apart and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> should fail to keep their promises to democratize. The determination of whether expedited procedures should be initiated would be made by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION>, according to a fact sheet on the package. But Republicans were skeptical of the provision, saying it was not a solid guarantee that military aid would come to a quick vote in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he was `` not necessarily'' confident of the votes to pass the package. Republicans have remained aloof from the drafting process, holding out for more aid and for continued authority for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to deliver previously stockpiled eapons. `` The key to this really will be how much support it gets on the Republican side,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a longtime Contra aid opponent who added that he planned to vote against the package. Other Democrats said they expected at least 70 in their party to oppose the proposal. `` The party is seeking a middle ground on an issue that is not compromisable,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION> `` It appears to me to be an exercise in attempting to cover ourselves'' and avoid political blame if the Contras go out of business and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> renege on promises to increase civil liberties. Democrats have argued against new military aid, saying that providing it would endanger peace efforts. Talks between the Contras and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> broke off over the weekend without progress, and no date has been set for their resumption. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and many congressional Republicans have countered that it is only consistent military pressure from rebel attacks that has forced the Sandinistas into peace talks.

<TEXT>
 A dozen turbaned, bearded men with machine guns patrol a walled villa where the seven leaders of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s guerrilla alliance draw up plans for an Islamic nation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The meetings have become almost continuous in this dusty frontier city, a short ride from the Afghan border, since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> announced last month it planned to pull out troops backing <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said it would withdraw its estimated 115,000 soldiers within ten months starting May 15 if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> sign a peace agreement by March 15. With the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks entering a crucial stage on Wednesday, the time pressure is helping fuse the often fractious <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla military alliance into a united political force. `` They're closer than before but the question is, for how long?'' said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>, a guerrilla commander from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> province. So far, the resistance leaders have agreed to install themselves as a joint executive over a 28-member cabinet that will include guerrillas, Afghan refugees and Moslems `` presently living in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.'' It calls for the head of a cabinet to be head of state, but the plan contains no names. It proposes to replace the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government before an accord is signed at the U.N.-sponsored talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Neither <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which backs the guerrillas, nor the Afghan communists appears likely to accept the proposal unchanged. The Pakistanis have told the insurgents they may have to share power with the communists, at least in a transitional regime. `` We're in a hurry. There is little time,'' said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Qadir </PERSON> <PERSON> Karyad </PERSON>, head of the political wing of the fervent Moslem party Hezb-i-Islami, led by <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>. Although his party is considered the most extreme of the `` fundamentalist'' groups, <PERSON> Karyad </PERSON> indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> was coming around to compromise with the more moderate ones in the name of unity. `` We want to be logical. We want to show the world we can accept responsibility for our country,'' <PERSON> Karyad </PERSON> said. Nevertheless, the guerrillas' blueprint for a new government does not explain just how it would come to power. It assumes the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime will simply step aside. The flurry of compromise follows <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s insistence that an Afghan settlement must consist of a military accord, such as the one near completion at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, and a political accord for a `` broad-based'' interim government that could head off a bloody power struggle as Soviet troops head home. The three `` moderate'' guerrilla parties _ Ittehad, the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> _ apparently have dropped their support of bringing back ousted King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> to head a neutral transitional regime. `` It's not really proper to raise the <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> issue just now,'' said <PERSON> Zabiullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON>, son of ANLF leader <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON>. `` We should have a leader from within the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>. If not, then we can consider that option.'' All seven parties fully agree on one point: They refuse to join even a temporary coalition with communists. `` How can I work in an office with somebody who killed my brother, my neighbors?'' said <PERSON> Karyad </PERSON>. Hezb-i-Islami, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> faction led by alliance chairman <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON>, have gone so far as to threaten to ignore a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord as long as the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> are excluded from the talks. The indirect negotiations have been between the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which serves as the guerrillas' headquarters and shelters about 3.5 million Afghan refugees. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which backs the guerrillas, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are to be the guarantors of an accord. All seven resistance parties say they want to negotiate directly with the Soviets because they view the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s puppet `` I hope the Soviets will be wise enough to sit down and discuss the technicalities -LRB- of a withdrawal -RRB- with the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> said.

 Here is a brief look at what the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> hopes to achieve in the March 2 negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> between its ally, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. _ Through their <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> allies, the Soviets likely will formally commit themselves to withdrawing their estimated 115,000 troops starting May 15 and to completing the process within 10 months. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced the plan on Feb. 8. _ The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is likely to reiterate its demand that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and other Western countries stop supplying weapons to the Moslem guerrillas fighting the pro-Soviet <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. The Soviets have suffered heavy losses of aircraft since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> first began sending the rebels Stinger antiaircraft missiles, which can track and down aircraft by sensing engine heat. _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said his country wants no say in who governs <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> or the country's politics after the troops come home. Even so, he is expected to seek some guarantee that a bloodbath will not occur during or after the troop withdrawal. Without such a promise, Afghan leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and members of his government, as well as departing Soviets, would be left defenseless against a widespread insurgency, which could lead to reprisal killings. _ The Soviets likely will resist any attempts by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to tie an Afghan settlement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to formation of a coalition government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s future government should be decided as `` an internal matter.'' Ranking Soviet officials have accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of delaying a settlement by insisting the future government issue be resolved before the troop withdrawal begins. Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> contended in a Pravda interview published Thursday that the future government `` has nothing to do with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements.''

 Here is a brief look at what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hopes to achieve in the negotiations between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>: _ The withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has been a high priority for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since the Soviet occupation began in December 1979. Quick withdrawal remains an immediate goal of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the anti-Marxist Moslem guerrillas and the pro-Western government in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which has provided sanctuary for 3.5 million Afghans and channels millions of dollars in covert military aid to the resistance from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials welcomed the statement by <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that he wants to start pulling the estimated 120,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by May 15 if U.N.-sponsored negotiations produce an agreement by March 15. But the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is pushing the Soviets to either shorten their proposed 10-month withdrawal, or to pull out most troops early. `` We do n't see any reason why they could n't be out by the end of the year if they start in the middle of May,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Under a plan being discussed behind the scenes, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would stop sending military aid as soon as the Soviets began to withdraw. Half the Soviet troops would withdraw within the first 90 days, 30,000 more over the next 90 days, and the remaining 30,000 over the following four months. _ A longer term goal, on which guerrilla groups and the Pakistani government are split, is over the government to replace the Soviet-backed regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe that no pro-Soviet regime could survive after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> leaves. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said this month that the guerrillas would not accept positions in a government run by President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, the head of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. `` It is difficult to imagine how an interim regime is going to be put together,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said.

 For <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s governor-in-exile, it has come to high noon Here in the land of <PERSON> Geronimo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Earp </PERSON> and the OK Corral, a part of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> never known for pussyfooting, the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday begins the final act in a course of redress not seen in this nation in more than half a century. It will decide whether to remove the impeached governor from office. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will not predict the outcome, only that it likely will be close and that however it turns out there will be, politically speaking, a lot of blood left on the ground. `` It's ripping up our party and state in a fashion that's going to take years to recover,'' says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>. When <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> and three other <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation suggested that fellow Republican <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> resign, the senator began receiving hate mail by the sackful `` The mob that crucified our Precious Lord is the same kind of mob that is after our governor,'' wrote one constituent. The other day about 2,000 <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporters took out their anger, while raising money for his defense, by bashing an automobile with a sledgehammer, three licks for a dollar. The car was painted with slogans such as `` media bias,'' identifying what they perceived as the causes of the governor's predicament. The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved impeachment articles Feb. 5 accusing <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, misusing $ 80,000 from funds raised by his inauguration committee, and trying to thwart an investigation into a state official's alleged death threat against a witness in a grand jury probe of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. The 63-year-old, staunchly conservative governor also had antagonized many Arizonans with controversial statements on ethnic groups and social issues. After the vote, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> stepped down provisionally as governor and moved into political exile, in an office in nearby <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>. Now the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> charges are to be tried in the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where 20 votes would convict him and remove him permanently from office. But not even the extreme measure of an impeachment trial is likely to put to rest the turmoil in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> survives, he still faces a criminal trial for not reporting a campaign loan and a recall election resulting from a public petition. Recall election? All right then, said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporters, and began circulating petitions to recall as well <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who voted for the governor's impeachment. Yes, there is little stability these days in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> politics. Anywhere in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, for that matter. The <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area, <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, is the second-fastest-growing urban area in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, just behind <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. It gains one new citizen every 12 minutes. That's net gain. State figures also show that for every four newcomers, three others move out. All that coming and going causes such instability that one mental health organization recommended a state program to discourage growth. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, for instance, has one of the nation's highest divorce rates, a suicide rate 50 percent higher than the national average and, among adolescents, 70 percent higher It also ranks last in per-capita funding for mental health. `` We have an enormous amount of work to do in this state,'' says state Sen. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> Republican. `` That's another reason why the impeachment is such a distracting turn of events. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be tied up with it for weeks. Important matters that should be dealt with this session will have to be deferred to the next.'' <PERSON> Lunn </PERSON> has a special interest in environmental matters. Well he might. The <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area is promoted to tourists and potential settlers as the Valley of the Sun. But dust and emissions and temperature inversions conspire against the sun. <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>'s smog rivals the worst in the nation. So do its traffic jams.

 Once outside <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, however, or <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, the state's only two urban areas, you can drive for hours without seeing another car. Geographically as well as politically and socially, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> is a state of stunning contrasts and contradictions. The state is sixth in the nation in size but its 3.35 million population ranks 25th. Three-fourths of its people live in the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> metropolitan areas. The rest live in villages and towns scattered across mountains and deserts and forests staggering in their solitude, and, in many areas, their poverty. In rural areas much of the frontier west prevails, and not just in the rigorously independent attitude of the people. At <LOCATION> Cordes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Prescott </LOCATION>, the cafe requires patrons to check their weapons at the door. Many do just that, since in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> it's perfectly legal to pack a gun openly Rivalry in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> is fierce between city and country for the state's attention to their needs. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was supported by rural voters who saw his two election opponents as representing the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> elite. His impeachment intensifies those jealousies. Feelings for and against <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> are held with such passion that some longtime friends are reluctant to bring up the subject, not knowing how the other stands. `` Some thingsks and Orientals. He dismissed those petitioning for his recall as `` dissident Democrats and homosexuals.'' Now it comes down to the impeachment trial itself. Only 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governors have faced impeachment proceedings. Only seven were removed from office, the last <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> in 1928. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> was once impeached, in 1781 as governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. His accuser was <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, who thought <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> left the capital with unseemly haste when British troops attacked. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> insisted on a trial and won vindication. So <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, it appears, is in pretty good company. But, then, so are his accusers.

 The battle for the White House wo n't be the only thing on the minds of some Super Tuesday voters. In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, they'll begin choosing a new senator; in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s 4th District they may elect a new congressman, and in <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, they'll decide whether to legalize sales of mixed drinks. Of the 20 mostly Southern and border states holding presidential primaries and caucuses March 8, four _ <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ are holding their regular state primaries at the same time. But even in places where the state primary will be held later, officials have slipped statewide or local issues onto the Super Tuesday ballot. `` It's a cost-effective measure and it would tend to draw a larger turnout for both issues,'' explains <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> division of elections. In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, the retirement of Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON> after 41 years has sparked a close Democratic primary race between Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman, says the combination of the presidential and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primaries `` should ensure a pretty good turnout.'' Rep. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> is unopposed for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. In <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Democratic Sens. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> faces token challenges for renomination and will be heavily favored over whichever Republicans win their party's nominations <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> also has primaries for five of nine seats on its <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which has become a political battleground with two justices publicly reprimanded, two others quitting and Republicans hoping to achieve an unprecedented majority. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> features a heated Democratic primary in the 1st Congressional District, where 10-term Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> is challenged by campaign consultant <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Glascock </PERSON>, who says the incumbent neglects his district and spends too much time jetting to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> secretary of state estimated it would have cost $ 12 million extra to hold separate state and presidential primaries. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> attorney general's office said the two parties would have had to `` raise filing fees to an unholy amount'' to finance separate primaries. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, voters in the 4th District will select a replacement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House for Gov.-elect <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who takes office on March 14. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> asked that the balloting be scheduled for Super Tuesday to cut down on election costs in his financially strapped state. Nine Democrats and one Republican are competing in the open primary in which a candidate is elected if he receives a majority. Otherwise, the top two finishers compete in a runoff. The field includes former Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, who lost to <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> in 1980 following <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>'s acquittal on vote-buying charges. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, legislators added a statewide referendum to the ballot with the hope of bolstering turnout for the presidential primary. The measure asks voters whether to increase from $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 the amount of gross income people 62 and older may receive and still be exempt from some school and property taxes. `` Every presiding officer that I've talked with, every governor, is worried about a low turnout,'' said Speaker of the House <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> prior to pushing the referendum through the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. `` We need a tremendous turnout _ the more folks the better.'' In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, referendums on whether to permit mixed drink sales are scheduled in <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> and three other cities and counties. `` This is an excellent way to avoid the cost of a separate election,'' said state Treasurer <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyles </PERSON>. `` In <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, for example, they're having a separate election and it will cost something like $ 100,000.'' In <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, state Election Coordinator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Haines </PERSON> estimates that about 40 of 95 counties will hold their primaries for tax assessor and school superintendent on March 8, mainly to save money. The <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> last year appropriated $ 2 million to cover the cost of the presidential primary, and gave counties the option of conducting their county primaries then at state expense or in May at their own. Counties must also pay for the August statewide primary and the November general election. Ironically, in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, two ballot issues relating to economic development were taken off the March 8 ballot and rescheduled for September because of fears that they would n't get the necessary attention because of the presidential campaign. `` The two were so important that we were afraid they would get lost in all the hullabaloo, in all the things going on,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON>'s assistant press secretary, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>.

 Footwear maker <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been using the Beatles' recording of the song `` Revolution'' in its advertising despite the group's protests, plans to scrap the ads next month. <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the athletic footwear company was happy with the results of the ads, which have been running since last spring, but wants to freshen its advertising approach. As a result, he said <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> decided against exercising its option to use the Beatles' recording for another year. Its license to use the recording expires March 22, but before it runs out, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> plans to run one more new commercial with the song. The new ad, which debuts this week, is aimed mainly at women, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Revolution'' commercials to date have shown people walking, playing basketball and participating in other sports while wearing <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> shoes. The only sound is the Beatles' recording. The three surviving Beatles, through their recording company, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, have claimed they never intended that their recordings be used in commercials. <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Beaverton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, has insisted it is an innocent bystander in a longstanding dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> and companies that hold the licensing rights to the Beatle's original recordings. <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> reportedly paid $ 250,000 to <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which holds the North American licensing rights to the Beatles' recordings, for the right to use the group's rendition of `` Revolution'' in <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> ads for a year Last July, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, controlled by the three surviving Beatles and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>, filed a suit charging that <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> was using the rock group's `` persona and goodwill'' in its advertising without permission. The suit, which is still pending in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, asked for $ 15 million in damages and named <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> and its ad agency, <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> EMI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which holds licensing rights outside <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> has contended it had a valid contract to use the recording, intended no disrespect to the Beatles and was an innocent victim in a dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>, Capitol and <ORGANIZATION> EMI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, an attorney for Apple, said he felt the decision showed <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> was `` being responsive to the lawsuit and the numerous complaints of Beatles fans'' about its use of the recordings. He said he was optimistic that after <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION>'s action `` we will be able to reach a settlement of the case with <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> shortly.'' But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> insisted the decision not to renew rights to the music was unrelated to the suit. `` It was a business decision,'' he said. `` It makes sense to continuously update your ads.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> had received about 150 to 200 letters from people objecting to <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION>'s use of the song, but said the company was generally satisfied with the performance of the ads. He said sales for the six months ended Nov. 30 were up substantially from the same period a year earlier.

 <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, which sought bankruptcy-court protection because of the stalled $ 5.2 billion <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant, has attracted takeover interest from a neighboring utility. The proposed takeover disclosed Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Westborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, would not include <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 36 percent share of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>. It also would require approval by a bankruptcy judge, state regulators in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, both companies' directors and possibly some federal agencies <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s largest power company and the lead <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> owner, sought federal bankruptcy protection last month, a move that symbolized the difficulties facing public utilities with heavy investments in nuclear power. It became the first major investor-owned utility to seek the refuge of bankruptcy court since the Depression. Under <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, would be left only with its share of the reactor, which is completed but has been unable to surmount evacuation-planning obstacles to an operating license. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owns 10 percent of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>. Officials of the parent company would not comment on why they do n't want to increase their share of the controversial plant. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON>, president of the parent company, said in a statement that the takeover would let the new <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> pay its share of the costs of keeping <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> ready while plant owners keep fighting for an operating license. <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON> did not explain how that would happen. A spokesman for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s joint owners, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanzoni </PERSON>, speculated that `` It would be likely that there would be some kind of cash infusion that would be part of the arrangement'' to let the new <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> maintain its share of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> carrying costs, estimated at $ 3 million to $ 4 million a month. <PERSON> Scanzoni </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> would want to continue supporting <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> since it already owns a chunk of the plant. `` In many ways this a very positive step for <ORGANIZATION> Seabrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Scanzoni </PERSON> said of the takeover talks. One <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> foe said he ca n't see how the takeover would let the remaining <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> pay <ORGANIZATION> Seabrook </ORGANIZATION> carrying costs on its own. `` They ca n't gt any revenue out of it unless they license it,'' <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Backus </PERSON> noted. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> law bars utilities from charging ratepayers for power plants before they operate commercially. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld that law on Jan. 26, denying <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> an emergency rate increase and forcing the utility to seek bankruptcy protection two days later. A Wall Street utility analyst, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scotto </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> L.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said a takeover would make business sense for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> since aside from <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is a profitable company. But `` this is not going to be clear sailing,'' Scotto said, partly because of unresolved questions about ratemaking authority. <PERSON> Scotto </PERSON> also said the proposal indicates <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> is showing a lack of confidence in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>'s prospects. Evacuation plans for a 10-mile zone around <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> must be approved before the plant can be licensed. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a Democratic presidential hopeful, has played a key role in blocking the plant by refusing to submit plans for six communities in his state within the zone. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> has submitted its own plans for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. No hearings have been set on them yet.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> faced intensified takeover pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> after the power-tool maker raised its offer to $ 2.11 billion, but analysts began to query whether the price was getting expensive. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said Tuesday it would pay $ 68 a share for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, compared with $ 65 a share or about $ 2.03 billion offered previously. It was the third time <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> has raised the offer. Some Wall Street securities analysts were surprised and said the price was becoming inflated for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment. It has been maneuvering to escape a takeover. `` They -LRB- Black & amp; Decker -RRB- obviously see something I do n't see,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The bidding has gotten to the point where I ca n't justify the $ 68 price. He said the bidding `` already is a bit on the rich side.'' Others had expected <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> to raise the offer or drop the takeover attempt entirely after <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it had financing commitments for a recapitalization aimed at thwarting the hostile bid. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s latest offer, which would expire at midnight EST March 7, compares with the initial offer of $ 56 a share made in late January. The <LOCATION> Towson </LOCATION>, Md.-based manufacturer had said previously it would not raise the offer above $ 65 a share unless it could see American Standard's books. American Standard has rejected both previous offers as inadequate. The New York-based company urged shareholders Tuesday not to tender shares under the latest bid until it was reviewed by the board of directors. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 12 -LCB- cents to $ 68.25 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, while <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> dipped 12 -LCB- cents to $ 19.37 -LCB-. In a news release, <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said it also intended to file counterclaims in federal court in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> seeking to invalidate <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' takeover defense and to halt any action on the recapitalization. The $ 2.1 billion recapitalization plan would make <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> less attractive as a takeover target by boosting its long-term debt to more than $ 2 billion and sharply increasing its outstanding shares and equivalents, such as stock options. American Standard, incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, had asked the federal court to validate its poison pill, designed to make a takeover prohibitively expensive by diluting the target company's stock The court last week rejected <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s attempt to block American Standard from seeking such a ruling. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> also has challenged <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s new anti-takeover law as unconstitutional. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> is awaiting regulatory approval to begin a maneuver similar to a proxy fight to oust <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors.

<HEAD>Oil Giant Settles Old Pricing Dispute With $1.25 Billion Payment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to pay the government $ 1.25 billion to settle claims it overcharged customers during the 1973-81 era of price-controls removes one uncertainty confronting the troubled oil giant, which has been under federal bankruptcy court protection for nearly a year. But the third-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company still faces a complicated exit process from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a $ 3 billion payment to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a possible takeover fight with two well known corporate raiders and a back-tax bill of up to $ 6.5 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Under the overcharge-dispute settlement announced Tuesday with the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> will pay the first installment totaling $ 400 million, with the rest to be paid over 5 -LCB- years. It is one of the largest settlements ever reached between the government and a company. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s president, said in a statement that the company had set aside reserves for such a contingency and it would have no impact on earnings. <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> also said the settlement would free <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> from what he called a costly and time-consuming legal process and enable the company to concentrate its efforts on getting out of Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection. The company sought bankruptcy court refuge last April because of its protracted legal dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, which had won a record $ 10.3 billion judgment against the oil giant from a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> jury that ruled <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> unfairly sabotaged <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to buy part of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In December <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> settled that battle by agreeing to pay <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> $ 3 billion cash, but the company's efforts to return to normal operations have been complicated by disputes over its bankruptcy reorganization. In addition, the company faces a possible takeover threat from <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the company's largest shareholder. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, another well-known takeover strategist, also has expressed interest in buying <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s problems have been further complicated by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. Company officials said last month that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had told <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> it may owe $ 6.5 billion in back taxes because of possible undervaluations of oil purchased from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> from 1979-81. Some analysts have said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> would be virtually destroyed if it had to come up with that amount, but they also speculated the final bill would be much lower. The <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based oil giant is the latest in a line of companies forced to relinquish large sums of cash to resolve charges they violated pricing restrictions on crude oil and refined products during the eight-year period of federal controls. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandenberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said prior to the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> settlement, it received about $ 6.1 billion in settlement funds. He said the department expects to collect about $ 1 billion more to resolve similar claims, bringing the total to $ 8.2 billion. The government had argued that during the era of price controls, companies illegally profited by classifying `` old'' oil _ obtained from properties producing before 1973 _ as `` new'' oil and selling it at higher prices. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had argued that federal regulations defining old and new oil were ambiguous, but said Tuesday that challenging the government on this dispute was not worth the effort. <PERSON> Vandenberg </PERSON> said about 15 percent of the $ 1.25 billion settlement covered refined product price violations, with the money destined to go into a fund to repay injured parties. The remaining 85 percent covers crude price violations, and a fifth of that will go into the injured party fund and the rest will be split evenly between the federal government and the states, he said. Late last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> extended the deadline for injured parties to file claims to June 30. More than 16,000 claims had been filed before the extension. The agency said at that time that a claim for a million gallons of refined products overcharged would mean about $ 800 coming to the claimant. Most of the injured parties are businesses, school districts and municipalities that kept detailed records of crude oil and refined products purchased from oil concerns that the government accused of overcharging. Other companies that have paid to settle complaints include <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it was able to expand its largest automatic transmission plant without interrupting production and at less than half the cost of similar projects because of worker participation. `` It truly was a team approach. Each plant area analyzed how the expansion and quality improvements could be achieved. Issues were discussed openly and plans were refined to reflect the suggestions of each team,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickol </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s transmission and chassis division, said Tuesday The $ 50 million project added 100,000 units to the plant's 795,000 yearly transmission production while improving quality and saving 190 jobs without interrupting the assembly line, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said The expansion has helped ease a shortage of automatic transmissions for rear-wheel-drive cars and trucks, particularly <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s popular F-series pickup, that use 4.9-liter, six-cylinder engines and 5.0-liter V-8 engines. The F-series pickup was the best-selling vehicle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 and 1987, but <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was forced to offer incentives to boost sales of manual transmission trucks because it did n't have enough automatic transmissions, company spokesman <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenslade </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greenslade </PERSON> said a comparable transmission plant expansion would have cost $ 100 million to $ 150 million. <PERSON> Nickol </PERSON>'s remarks reflect what has become cliche at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, where top executives never note a new profit, sales or quality achievement without crediting hourly workers and their cooperation with management. But the employees, hourly and salaried, who have worked together on the project since September 1986 and who will live with its results, say it proves that cooperative management is more than a 1980s buzzword. `` It's certainly the way we'll go from now on, on any new program,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Livonia </LOCATION> Transmission plant's manufacturing manager <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said the expansion saved jobs that would have been cut if efficiency had improved but total production did not.

<HEAD>Finance Ministry Council Seeks Tighter Laws Against Insider
Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> committee Wednesday approved a report calling for tougher laws against insider trading on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s stock markets, where traders say information about companies frequently is leaked to selected investors The ministry's <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved an advisory panel's findings, including a recommendation that insider trading be made a criminal rather than a civil offense. It proposed that the offense carry a penalty of up to three years in prison and a fine of up to 3 million yen, or $ 23,000, ministry officials said. The panel also called for a revision of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current securities and exchange law to specifically prohibit insider trading, or the use of inside information about companies to profit on stock markets. Other recommendations called for an expansion of the ministry's investigation powers and a tightening of the definition of actions falling under insider trading laws, the officials said Ministry officials now will formulate legislation based on the panel's recommendations to submit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament, probably this spring. Large-scale insider trading is limited in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because of the infrequency of corporate takeovers, analysts say. But leaks of information about company developments to certain investors is believed to be frequent, along with stock manipulation by some large brokerages, financial sources say. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s markets are dominated by four large securities firms _ <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> _ creating a climate favorable to market manipulation. The advisory panel began forming its recommendations about two months ago, after allegations of stock sales by officials at a chemical company shortly before it announced bankruptcy, news reports said. Implementation of the recommendations will make <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> the last major industrialized country to adopt such regulations, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- NHK-TV -RRB- reported. The panel said insider trading restrictions should apply to employees and others inside companies that issue stocks, to underwriting securities firms, lawyers and certified public accountants, and to reporters that have access to sensitive information. The report also recommended that securities firms be required to report the stock ownership of large stockholders. The changes are not likely to take effect before the summer of 1989 because of a one-year notice period necessary for the strengthened criminal penalties, officials said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s four major commercial banks, said Wednesday that its 1987 profit plummeted 70.8 percent, largely because it raised its provisions for loans to Latin American and other countries. <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> said it earned 185 million pounds, or $ 327 million last year, compared with 633 million pounds, or $ 1.12 billion, in 1986. Included in the 1986 figure was a one-time gain of 21 million pounds, or $ 37 million, from the disposal of certain assets. On a per-share basis, that works out to 25.8 pence, or 46 cents, a share, vs. 88.9 pence, or $ 1.57, a share in the previous year. Last summer, <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> raised its provisions against loans to lesser developed countries to 30 percent of its total loans outstanding, then increased that stake at the end of the year. As of Dec. 31, its total provisions stood at 716 million pounds, or $ 1.27 billion _ 35 percent of the bank's total 2.026 billion pounds, or $ 3.59 billion, outstanding. `` The results achieved in our group operations through the year reflect a credible performance,'' said Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON>. `` Even though we decided to recognize the further deterioration in the quality of <ORGANIZATION> LDC </ORGANIZATION> debt by making further provisions, the impact on our capital has been comfortably absorbed.'' <PERSON> Barclays </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wedd </PERSON>, the bank's investment banking subsidiary, reported a loss of 11 million pounds, or $ 19 million, for the year, compared with a profit of 1 million pounds, or $ 1.77 million, the year before. <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> said the unit was profitable up to October and in the final two months of the year, but that trading losses suffered during the crash pushed it into the red. The unit announced last November that it lost 50 million pounds, or $ 89 million, during the crash. Profits from <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unit were hurt by the fall of the dollar. The bank said profit grew 14 percent in dollar terms, but only 1.6 percent in terms of pounds _ to 64 million pounds, compared with 63 million.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 7 grafs to UPDATE with fourth-quarter trade
deficit figures; uppicks 3rd graf pvs: The new...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's foreign trade deficit edged down to $ 40.2 billion in the final three months of 1987, pressured lower by a 6 percent boost in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> overseas sales, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported today. In the previous quarter, the gap had hit a record $ 40.4 billion, while the year finished with an overall record $ 159.3 billion deficit, calculated on a balance-of-payments basis. The new figures confirmed a yearend narrowing of the trade shortfall that already had shown up in the department's monthly merchandise trade reports. Those parallel figures showed a $ 43 billion deficit for the fourth quarter and a $ 171.9 deficit for all of 1987. Today's figures are smaller because they subtract factors such as the cost of shipping, insurance and military sales from the monthly numbers. The balance-of-payments deficit is also adjusted for seasonal variations, while the monthly merchandise figures are not. Exports increased $ 3.9 billion, or 6 percent, in the final quarter of 1987, to $ 69.1 billion, bolstered by the weakening dollar, which made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more price-competitive overseas. The report came one day after <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he did not forsee a recession or heightened inflation this year. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> made his assessment in testimony Tuesday before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where he appeared unperturbed by a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that orders for so-called `` big ticket'' American-made durable goods fell 2.8 percent in January. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chief, who wields enormous control over interest rates and the supply of money, said the risk of a recession is about equal to the risk of renewed inflation, but he agreed with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that neither appears imminent. The remarks by the head of the nation's central bank were seen as inconclusive by the financial markets. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 1.17 points to 2,039.12, while the price of the key 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond rose about $ 7.50 for every $ 1,000 in face value. The dollar was lower against most major foreign currencies. The decline in orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for durable goods reflected a return to more normal levels of demand for aircraft and primary metals, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The steep decline, only the third setback in the past 13 months, was the biggest since an 8 percent drop in January 1987. The latest figures followed a big December advance of 4.1 percent, the strongest rise since March. `` The numbers that were released on durable goods, if one subtracts some of the temporary fluctuations, were really quite strong,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said during an appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Delivering the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s semi-annual report on monetary policy to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> took pointed exception to the economic philosophies espoused by chief <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>. If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had let the nation's money supply grow to the extent <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> would have liked, it would have spawned an `` unduly inflationary environment,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. Analysts suggested that <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s testimony did not signal any imminent <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> action on interest rates. `` He left himself a lot of room to either tighten or loosen,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said there are signs `` that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does not know what it wants to do yet It is seeing some very conflicting signals from the economy and it wants to leave itself as much room to react as it can.''

 A federal judge's landmark ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was liable for the cost of cleaning up Love Canal strengthens anti-pollution laws nationwide, a federal official says. After nine years' deliberations, Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> was responsible because wastes generated by the company's plant were stored in a way that would eventually result in leakage. A trial expected to start in 1990 will determine the amount of damages, but state and federal officials say $ 200 million has already been spent on the cleanup and estimate that $ 50 million more will be required. The judge ruled in a 1979 lawsuit filed by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. In 1978, earlier, toxic chemicals at <LOCATION> Love </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> prompted state officials to evacuate children and pregnant women, and eventually 728 families. Of those, 175 families are still waiting to learn whether it is safe to return. <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>'s ruling upheld the federal <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Response </ORGANIZATION>, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. The judge said that law was designed to compel the waste disposal industry `` to correct its past mistakes and to provide a solution for the dangers posed by inactive abandoned waste sites.'' `` This will strengthen environmental laws throughout the country,'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Land and Natural Resources Division, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the company did not agree with the decision and would appeal. `` The decision which has just been issued on partial summary judgment, without a trial and without any factual determination, that <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> had acted negligently or with fault contradicts the resolution of these problems by amicable adjustments reached in other actions involving <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said. The law entitles a judge to determine the issue of liability, and the next stage of the case is a trial to determine the amount of damages, said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Littlefield </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> district. In its motions, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> had challenged that procedure. About 1,300 former residents of the Love Canal neighborhood accepted a $ 20 million damage settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. The eventual amount <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> pays will depend on costs proved in court and assessed by the judge. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' staff said that $ 200 million has been spent so far and it is estimated that there will be $ 50 million more in costs <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, a former Love Canal resident who runs the Citizen's Clearing House for Hazardous Wastes in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said she hopes the company will be found liable for the full $ 250 million `` That will at least make them blink,'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said. The company said it was covered by insurance and that the expenses would not adversely affect its finances. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> contended that it was not responsible for the landfill because <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was later acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> in 1968, yielded ownership to the <ORGANIZATION> Niagara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in 1953. The board built a school on the grounds. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said the construction project broke a clay seal on the dump and allowed the chemicals to leach into the environment. The company acknowledged that <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> dumped 20,000 tons of chemical wastes into the canal during the late 1940s and early'50s. <PERSON> Littlefield </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> district, said Tuesday's decision was `` a great victory for the state because it means companies are indeed responsible for what they've done in years past.'' State Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the decision was `` a resounding defeat for <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s strenuous and expensive public relations campaign to shift the entire blame for Love Canal.'' <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>'s ruling does, however, allow <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> to sue other parties the chemical giant contends should share the responsibility. The company is expected to countersue the state, the city of <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and its school board. <PERSON> Nunzio </PERSON> <PERSON> Loverdi </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Love </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> should accept the decision and not take action against the city and school board because if it does we will all suffer. We want to get on with our lives and put this behind us.''

 A federal judge has rejected <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s request to block <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s new corporate anti-takeover law, but did not rule on the constitutionality of the statute. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Longobardi </PERSON> on Tuesday rejected <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s request for an injunction against the law, which it contended was hindering its attempt to acquire <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, a power tool and household appliance maker based in <LOCATION> Towson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, has a hostile $ 68 a share, or $ 2.12 billion, tender offer outstanding for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> but incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> American Standard had rejected two previous <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> offers, and proposed a defensive recapitalization that analysts have valued at between $ 68 and $ 71 a share. American Standard rose 50 cents to $ 68.75 a share in early <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> dipped 50 cents to $ 18.87 -LCB-. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s new anti-takeover law was enacted on Feb. 2, and immediately was challenged as unconstitutional by <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>.. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> also claimed shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, an air-conditioning, plumbing and building products company, were confused by the law and reluctant to tender their shares But <PERSON> Longobardi </PERSON> rejected the request for an injunction. He ruled <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> had n't shown it would suffer irreparable harm under the law, and therefore would not rule on its constitutionality. `` Such a gratuitous discussion of the constitutionality of -LRB- the statute -RRB- could be used to upset the balance between the parties in the quest for their respective positions,'' <PERSON> Longobardi </PERSON> said of the takeover battle. The court also noted that <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> was attempting to take control of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> board, and if successful then could exempt the company from the law. The boards of directors of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> corporations have 90 days from the law's enactment to exempt their companies. Under the law, any shareholder who acquires more than 15 percent of a company's stock is prohibited for three years from entering a business combination that would allow the stockholder to acquire the firm. If a takeover is launched before the law is triggered, the bidder would have to acquire 85 percent of the outstanding shares in a single transaction to complete the merger. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Geer </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, said the company was `` gratified'' by the decision. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Templeton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s assistant secretary of state, said he was `` encouraged by the decision.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said today that he had `` objected quite strongly'' to an instance of political pressure from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and warned that further pressure on the central bank could be counterproductive. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said his protest was sparked by a letter written in January by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary for economic affairs. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was questioned about the letter by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., who said the letter was one of a series of recent attempts by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates as a way of spurring economic growth during a presidential election year `` I think it is both deplorable and counterproductive for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to pressure you as much as they have in recent months,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that he had a disagreement with both <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, over the matter of money growth. He said that while disagreements over policy were acceptable he was concerned about the manner in which the administration's criticism could be perceived by financial markets `` When I heard about Dr. <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>'s letter I objected quite strongly. As best as I could determine, he was not aware of the implications,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. `` I am reasonably sure such an action will not occur in the future.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said his concern was that the letter was sent in the weeks before a key meeting where top <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials were going to set monetary targets for the next year. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> did not say with whom he raised his objections, although it has been reported that <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was instrumental in toning down criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in the economic report of the president before it was released last week. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he fully expected to have policy disputes with this administration and the next administration, but he added, `` The only thing I hope that does not happen is that the concern over political pressure gets so extraordinary that we end up taking actions'' in the opposite direction just to prove that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is independent. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s comments on political pressure came during the second day of his congressional testimony on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s economic outlook and monetary targets for 1988. In his appearance Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> had also been critical of <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>'s monetary arguments. In the president's report, <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> suggested that tight-fisted Fed policies were partly to blame for the collapse of the stock market on Oct. 19. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> is a proponent of `` monetarism,'' the theory that steady growth in the money supply is esential to economic growth. The president's report noted that the money supply expanded very slowly last year, below the targets set by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. One measure of the money supply, M-2, grew just 4 percent in 1987, the slowest increase in almost three decades. The advance was even below the rate of inflation, something that has occurred only three previous times. In each of those instances, a recession followed. Asked about this, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> contended that money growth was influenced by special factors last year and that traditional relationships between money growth and economic activity have broken down since banking deregulation created a host of new types of savings accounts. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that he and <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> had a `` difference of opinion on this particular issue.'' He argued that the central bank could not have allowed the money supply to grow more rapidly `` without creating an unduly inflationary environment.'' Private economists generally gave <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> high marks for his testimony, contending that he steered the proper course between concern about inflation and concern about economic growth. In setting monetary targets for 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> expanded the distance between the low-point and high-point of acceptable growth by a full percentage point, saying it was now aiming for M-2 growth of between 4 percent and 8 percent. This money growth will be enough to support economic growth this year of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent, as measured by the gross national product, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in its economic outlook. This would be in the range of the 2.4 percent GNP growth being forecast by the administration. `` <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> left himself a lot of room to ither tighten or loosen,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is seeing some very conflicting signals about the economy and it wants to leave itself as much room to react as it can.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> confirmed in his testimony that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, in an effort to keep the recovery alive, had taken a `` small easing step a few weeks ago.'' Many analysts had suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had eased slightly based on the fact that a variety of interest rates, including mortgage rates, have dropped sharply in the past six weeks. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that currently he believed the risks of a recession or accelerating inflation were about equal and said he agreed with the administration's view that neither appeared imminent. He said that it was still too early to assess the full impact of last year's stock market collapse but `` there are very few signs that we are about to tilt over'' into a recession.

 The stock market churned in place today, struggling to resume its recent rally after a pause on Tuesday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials eked out a .50 gain to 2,039.62 by noontime on Wall Street. But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 629 up, 673 down and 504 unchanged. Analysts said confidence has slowly been recovering lately after the market's historic drop last fall. The economy has so far shown no signs of suffering any drastic harm from the crash, and interest rates have fallen since that time. But traders have been taking a gingerly approach, recalling how gains built up over many months were wiped out in a few short days in October. Many Wall Streeters are watching to see whether the Dow Jones industrial average can surpass the 2,051.89 close it reached on Jan. 7, which stands as its post-crash closing high. <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was actively traded, down ~ at 29 -LRB-.

<HEAD>GM to Restore 1,900 Jobs at California Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today it will restore 1,900 jobs at its <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, plant on March 14 by putting both shifts back to work six weeks earlier than expected. The announcement came as <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> indicated it will be recalling about 8,600 workers nationwide to produce an extra 175,000 cars and trucks annually. The night shift at the <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION> plant was elminated Feb. 15 because <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> had too much unsold inventory of the <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firebirds </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camaros </ORGANIZATION> assembled there. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it expected the plant would operate with only one shift until at least May 2 or until the inventory was reduced. In a unique experiment that had run into stiff resistance among senior workers, all 3,800 of the plant's hourly workers were affected, with half being off for two weeks at a time, then returning to their jobs while the others were furloughed for two weeks. The staggered-layoff system was to have continued at least until May 2, or longer if necessary, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. Similar systems of staggered layoffs have been tested elsewhere in the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> system, but at <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION> the plan had to be approved in a vote by workers. The vote was required because when the workers agreed in 1986 to adopt Japanese-style work rules to speed production and cut costs, the company agreed to negotiate with the union to ease any impact from changes in staffing levels. In an initial vote, the plan was defeated by eight votes, but after some maneuvering the union agreed to hold a second vote and to do it at the plant so more workers with less seniority could cast ballots. The plan was approved on the second vote, despite grumbling by older workers that making all workers take part in the furloughs was an attack on seniority rights. The Camaros and Firebirds produced at the <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION> plant have been plagued for some time with slow sales. When <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> announced plans for the layoffs earlier this year, the company's inventory of the two cars was well in excess of 100 days, meaning it would take that long at existing sales rates to dispose of already-assembled cars. Normally, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> operates with about a 60-day inventory on its various models. With both shifts operating, the <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION> plant produces about 800 of the two car models daily.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said today he's disappointed by the decision by Oil, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union officials to withdraw from a proposed merger and said he considers the idea dead. `` We thought it was a perfect fit,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. `` The philosophies of the two unions are extremely close.'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s executive board voted to rescind its merger offer in the wake of Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> decision. `` Obviously, I'm quite disappointed by the outcome ... but we're going to go back and put it back together and go on,'' he said He said the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> will look for other ways to expand. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said the apparent sticking point for the <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> board was the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s inability to guarantee there would be no dues increases during its next regularly scheduled constitutional convention in 1990. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said he can not control what the delegates will do `` and therefore I consider it a closed deal.'' The <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> board voted late Tuesday to reject the merger proposal. `` There's a decision from <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> not to go forward,'' spokesman <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said late Tuesday night. `` I do n't know that that sets everything in concrete. But that's where it stands for now.'' A news conference had been tentatively set for this morning to announce the merger, but the <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> backed out after meeting with <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> leaders most of Tuesday afternoon. The merger would have bolstered the strength of the two energy workers' unions, whose memberships have been shrinking throughout the last decade. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> board has authority to approve a merger without a vote of its full membership, though <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> said any merger required a two-thirds majority vote at the <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> convention in August. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> find themselves negotiating with the same companies, `` because the major oil companies own the lion's share of the energy and coal reserves in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. Since 1986, the two unions have been sharing information about employers. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> once had more than 400,000 members, but it now has about 85,000 active members _ about two-thirds of the nation's working miners. <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> membership is down by half from a peak of nearly 200,000 members in the early 1970s.

 The computers and high technology now used to search for oil and gas would have been a mystery to <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who relied largely on a hunch to drill the famed 1901 Spindletop gusher. `` There was almost no science at <LOCATION> Spindletop </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingston </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> geologist. `` Today, it's just the reverse. We want to know all we can -LRB- about a prospect -RRB- before we drill.'' Using stunning advances in geology, geochemistry and other disciplines, oilmen now analyze a broad range of information in searching for unfound storehouses of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s most crucial commodity. `` There's no way to relate today to what we had in the past,'' says <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Halbouty </PERSON>. `` The technology has changed every day of every year that the industry has been alive.'' Central to nearly all the developments has been the increasing use of computers to sift, store and massage massive amounts of data. Among other things, computers can generate three-dimensional views of prospective drill sites based on information from rock samples, previous drilling and other sources, creating hypothetical composite pictures of what lies below grassy, forested or desert surfaces. `` In the past, the same process has been done with pencil and paper,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>. `` It's like comparing the <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> to the Concorde _ it's the same kind of advance.'' Advances in seismic technology have also aided the search for oil, says <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, divisional vice president of exploration and production technology division of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. By measuring the movement of seismic shock waves through the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, scientists can derive clues as to whether the waves are traveling through rock, sand or, possibly, unfound oil formations Since 1968, when plate tectonics _ the theory that <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s surface is composed of massive shifting rock plates _ became widely accepted, dramatic advances in geology have been made `` What plate tectonics does, instead of just hunt and peck here and there, you now have a unifying theory about how these plates were formed,'' said <PERSON> Manik </PERSON> <PERSON> Talwani </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Geotechnology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` It helps you very much in your guessing about which might be good oil provinces.'' In addition, developments in the complicated science of geochemistry have provided clues to locating oil through testing sample rocks in the laboratory, as have improvements in sensing equipment lowered into drill holes to conduct electrical and other analyses. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, another retired <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> geologist, now runs his own consulting firm specializing in analyzing satellite photos of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> for telltale signs of oil and gas deposits. In addition to being able to see large structural features that could hint of oil and gas, different kinds of rock and minerals often respond differently to varying light and infrared frequencies, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> says. `` The use of those -LRB- satellite photos -RRB- is among the most important new technologies that we've got in the business today,'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said, adding that future satellites may provide even more sophisticated data. Most experts agree oil and gas exploration remains a risky business fraught with the potential for failure, and new techniques only help to create a more comprehensive mosaic of information for decision-making. `` It's like putting together a jigsaw puzzle,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. `` You want to get as many pieces as possible.'' One reason for burgeoning technology in oil exploration has been the huge increase in drilling costs, which have risen sharply over the past 20 years, <PERSON> Halbouty </PERSON> says. What's more, most of the biggest deposits of oil and gas in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have already been found, making discoveries of smaller, more isolated remaining pockets more difficult, and more important, said <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, spokesman for the department of geosciences at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In 1901, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> decided to drill the Spindletop gusher on a small hill where he and others suspected oil might exist, but where a number of unsuccessful wells had been drilled. When the drillers hit a huge reserve of oil, a gusher of black gold shot hundreds of feet into the air, igniting the legendary <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil boom. During the 1950s and 1960s, <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> roamed the globe as geologists for <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> using what might now be considered rudimentary tools and techniques. <PERSON> Kingston </PERSON> takes a somewhat skeptical view of many advances. `` The same guy who finds oil with a computer is the same guy who can find oil without the computer,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> said. `` A geologist with his hammer and his eyes and his brain is far superior to anything else. `` Today, there are about 150 kinds of maps and studies that can be run in a certain area to study the geology, but there are only 10 or 12 that are really necessary,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The rest are just window dressing.'' For <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION>, technology can only aid human intuition, which remains the primary key to finding hidden treasure troves of oil and gas. `` An analogy would be reading a mystery novel with half the pages torn out, you have to guess about what is in there,'' <PERSON> Kingston </PERSON> said.

 Share prices edged higher in thin trading Wednesday, bringing an end to a strong two-day advance. Dealers attributed the session's dullness to a lack of market-affecting news and uninspiring performances on Wall Street on Tuesday and early Wednesday.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it boosted 1988 production plans by 175,000 cars and trucks and will recall 8,600 laid-off workers and reopen a temporarily closed assembly plant. `` The strengthening demand for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> vehicles reflects the ongoing product quality improvements resulting from plant modernization and employee involvement programs,'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> said in a statement. `` This combined with very competitive retail incentive programs has increased the value of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> products,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will increase production by running some plants, particularly for trucks, on overtime; restoring second shifts at two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants and one in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>; and reopening its closed <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, assembly plant. At the three plants where <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> had dropped the second shift, workers from both shifts were sharing jobs by alternating between two weeks on layoff and two weeks on the job, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> assembly plant, which <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> closed abruptly Nov. 30, will reopen May 9 on one shift with 2,000 of its 3,700 workers. The plant will build the Oldsmobile Cutlass Cierra, but will not resume production of the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celebrity </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will restore the second shift at its <ORGANIZATION> Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lansing </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant A-system on April 11, returning 2,000 people to full-time work. The 4,350-worker plants builds the <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cutlass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Calais </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skylark </ORGANIZATION>. The second shift at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s 4,200-worker <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, assembly plant will be restored March 14, bringing 1,900 employees back full time. The plant, which <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s only <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camaro </ORGANIZATION> and Pontiac Firebird source, dropped the second shift last week. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> also will restore the second shift at its Oshawa No. 1 plant in <LOCATION> Oshawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, bringing back 2,700 laid-off workers on March 21. The plant builds the Oldsmobile Cierra and <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> 6000. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it would increase production at its Cadillac plant in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> enclave of <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION> by running its single shift on overtime, adding 4,700 cars between Feb. 20 and June 1. Cadillac General Manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grettenberger </PERSON> said the increased production was necessary because dealers need more of the restyled <LOCATION> Eldorado </LOCATION> coupe and <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> sedans, whose popularity has been boosted by availability of a new 4.5-liter V-8 engine.

The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> president said he then convened a meeting of his union's board, which rescinded its earlier approval of the merger agreement, which contained no provisions for amendment <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said both unions would continue to work together, especially on negotiations with employers that the two unions have in common. While he plans to look for other ways to expand the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s influence, <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said, he does not consider it good policy `` to merge just for the sake of merging.

 <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> posted a 38.1 percent rise in profits in the latest three-month period, even though operating income fell, the company said Tuesday Net income rose to 23.68 billion Japanese yen, or about $ 193 million, from 17.1 billion yen in a corresponding reporting period in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> is shifting to a new fiscal year, so results for the three months ended Dec. 31, 1987, were compared with results for the period ended Nov. 30, 1986. Dollar equivalents were based on an exchange rate of 123 yen to the dollar prevailing at the end of 1987. Revenue rose 20.5 percent to 789.5 billion yen, or about $ 6.42 billion, from 655.3 billion yen a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s income from operations fell 31.4 percent to 32.4 billion yen, or $ 263 million, in the quarter, mainly because of the falling value of the dollar, which decreases the value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales when measured in yen. However, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s net profit rose because of successful foreign-exchange trading and decreased income taxes, among other factors, the company said.

 The stock market made little progress in a churning session Wednesday, struggling to resume its recent rally after a pause on Tuesday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 1.17 on Tuesday, edged up .83 to 2,039.95.

The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index lost .19 to 148.54. Analysts said confidence has slowly been recovering lately after the market's historic drop last fall. The economy has so far shown no signs of suffering any drastic harm from the crash, and interest rates have fallen since that time. But traders have been taking a gingerly approach, recalling how gains built up over many months were wiped out in a few short days in October. Many Wall Streeters are watching to see whether the Dow Jones industrial average can surpass the 2,051.89 close it reached on Jan. 7, which stands as its post-crash closing high. Most of the broader market indicators have already surpassed their January best, betokening the recent superior performance of many smaller, secondary issues compared with the blue chips that make up the Dow. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>, by far the lowest-priced component of the industrial average, jumped -RCB- to 5 -LCB- for a gain of 15.8 percent. Some Wall Street analysts have been recommending the stock lately as a participant in the recovery in the industrial sector of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> asked a federal appeals court Tuesday to stop the merger of two of the nation's largest manufacturers of glass containers while it appeals a lower court's refusal to halt the deal The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> asked the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> for a preliminary injunction to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest glass container manufacturer, from acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Brockway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 750 million during the appeal The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>, which obtained a provisional stay from the appellate court on Friday, contended that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> `` erred, both factually and legally, in holding that the merger is not likely to have anticompetitive effects.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> contends that the merger, which would create the nation's largest glass container manufacturer, would reduce competition and raise the price of bottles, jars and other containers the companies make for food, soft drinks and liquor. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who last week denied the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s bid to stop the merger pending administrative proceedings within the agency, accepted the companies' argument that competition from plastic and paper packaging would keep down the prices of glass containers. But the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said she `` disregarded extensive testimony by customers accounting for more than $ 450 million in annual glass container purchases that they will not or can not economically switch from glass containers to other package forms.'' The agency said <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s opinion `` disregards, without explanation, long-established legal standards for assessing the potential anticompetitive effects of horizontal mergers, including the significance of market concentration and entry barriers, as well as extensive customer testimony that prices are likely to rise as a result of the merger.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has stalled the merger since <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, made its tender offer last September to buy <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON> stock for $ 60 a share. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> had granted a temporary restraining order halting the merger while she reviewed the case, but she refused to grant a preliminary injunction. <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION> controls 22.7 percent of the market while <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, controls 15 percent of sales.

 <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its net earnings rose 19 percent in the second quarter, mainly because of improvements in its resource-exploration and industrial-automation units.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Hammered To 11-Month Low; Better Economic Outlook
Cited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Gold futures prices plunged to the lowest level in 11 months Wednesday, possibly reflecting a change in attitude among investors who had been expecting a surge in inflation, analysts said. On other markets, grain and soybean futures settled mostly higher, livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy futures retreated; and stock-index futures declined. Wednesday marked the second consecutive day of sharp declines in futures prices for gold and other precious metals, which had traded listlessly in narrow ranges for nearly a month. Tuesday's drop in prices was widely attributed to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s prediction that the 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation rate would average 3.25 percent to 3.75 percent, a rate lower than many market experts had projected. Demand and prices for precious metals typically rise during inflationary periods because they tend to hold their value better than other investments. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s forecast, along a general weakening of commodity prices recently, may have prompted a shift in attitude among investors who feared the worst after the October stock market collapse, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It seems to me that the market is getting more encouraged, in terms of inflation, that things are not going to get worse,'' <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> said. He said the confidence <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> displayed in his testimony Tuesday before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee `` seemed to enhance his credibility,'' which in turn may have given the markets more confidence. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziemian </PERSON> said Wednesday's selloff of gold futures appeared to spread from European markets to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the country's major market for precious metals futures `` The selling was substantial enough that, with only a limited amount of buying, it pushed the market down dramatically,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ziemian </PERSON> said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 9.90 to $ 13.90 lower with the contract for delivery in April at $ 434.10 a troy ounce, the contract's lowest price since March 20, 1987; silver was 10.5 cents to 13.4 cents lower with March at $ 6.195 a troy ounce. Grain and soybean futures ended mostly higher in fairly light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Corn was the most consistent performer, showing strength throughout the session on rumors that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had purchased as much as 2 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn overnight, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced after the close that the Soviets had bought 350,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. Soybeans lagged for the most of the day but ended mixed on a late surge of buying led by <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION>, a major player in the soybean pit, analysts said. Wheat ended slightly higher on talk of expected new export sales to <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> nations, <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. Wheat settled -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 3.17 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 1.99 a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent lower with March at $ 1.90 \ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 3 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 6.24 -RCB- a bushel Cattle futures settled mostly higher while pork futures ended mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle futures were supported by higher cash values but limited by sluggish wholesale demand for beef, said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Lower cash prices pressured pork, he said Live cattle settled .20 cent to .43 cent higher with April at 72.20 a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .45 cent higher with March at 80.92 cents a pound; hogs were .62 cent lower to .45 cent higher with April at 44.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .12 cent lower to .47 cent higher with March at 52.27 cents a pound. Oil prices slipped lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on technical factors after an early attempt to rally fizzled, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 14 cents lower with February at 15.76 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent to .52 cent lower with March at 46.40 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .15 cent to .55 cent lower with March at 46.35 cents a gallon.

 Gold prices tumbled Wednesday as traders appeared to take a more optimistic view of chances for continued low inflation. The dollar, meanwhile, turned in a narrowly mixed performance on the world's foreign-exchange markets. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid price for gold of $ 432.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $ 8.70 from Tuesday's late level Analysts who follow the precious metals markets said recent declines in commodity prices have convinced many traders that inflation poses little immediate threat to the economy, diminishing gold's appeal as a hedge against rising prices. `` They expect inflation to be moderate to subdued and that gives them very little reason to own gold,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsch </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> LNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He said some traders have been liquidating tangible assets such as gold in anticipation of investing the proceeds in the stock market, which has shown some strength over the past two weeks. But <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the latest decline in gold prices simply extends a trend begun late in 1987, reflecting heavier supplies in a sluggish market. He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has sold considerable amounts of gold and mining companies have become more aggressive about selling contracts for what they expect to mine. At the same time, investors have shown little interest in gold because of `` low inflation expectations, stable world equity markets, a strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market and rising confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. `` It is not that there has been a massive selloff. It is just that there is a lack of willingness to buy gold except at lower prices,'' he said. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fell $ 9.90 a troy ounce to $ 431.90. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold fell to $ 434.70 a troy ounce from $ 442.50 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, gold fell to $ 436 from $ 442 late Tuesday. Gold fell to $ 444.20 an ounce in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> from $ 446.80 late Tuesday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> on Wednesday criticized what he said was administration pressure for lower interest rates, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> denied knowledge of such an effort and voiced support for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman. In congressional testiony, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> had cautioned that further White House efforts to influence the central bank could boomerang. He referred in particular to a letter written by a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official pleading for easier credit. Asked at his Wednesday night news conference about <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s complaint, and whether he still had confidence in <LOCATION> Greenspan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied: `` Yes I do And I'm going to have to find out what this is all about that you're talking about, because nothing of that kind had been directed to me.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> post by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last summer, issued his warning as the administration sought to dampen its dispute with the central bank. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, said the administration currently is `` delighted with monetary policy.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was highly critical of a letter sent by Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> to top <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy-makers 10 days before they were to meet to set monetary growth targets for 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tries to supply enough money to the economy to support sustained growth while guarding against over-doing money creation and thus re-igniting inflation. Both <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Srinkel </PERSON> have complained that the money supply grew so sluggishly in 1987 that it raised concerns about a possible recession during this election year. The <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> letter was brought up in questioning by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., who cited it as just one of numerous examples of administration pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> While <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> did not release the text of <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>'s letter, the senator said the clear implication was that the administration was pressuring the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to `` ease up on the money.'' He said <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>'s letter to each member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was the most overt effort he had ever seen on the part of the administration to influence <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> decision-making. `` I think it is both deplorable and counterproductive for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to pressure you as much as they have in recent months,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said while the central bank was not being unduly influenced by the administration, he was worried about the perceptions in financial markets. `` The only thing that I hope does not happen is that the concern of our responding to political pressures gets so extraordinary that we will feel the necessity to do precisely the opposite,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said, `` When I heard about Dr. <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>'s letter I objected quite strongly. As best I can judge, he was not aware of the implications of doing this just prior to an <ORGANIZATION> FOMC </ORGANIZATION> meeting.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> indicated he had received assurances that there would be no repeat of the <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> letter. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and the other four members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> were all appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the first time one president has named all members of the board since <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. There is one vacancy. The normal <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> term is 14 years, a tenure designed to insulate the board from political pressures and also make it harder for one president to name all the board members. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said the current situation was raising concerns that the central bank would bend to administration pressure and boost money growth so much during this election year that the country would suffer another round of debilitating inflation in 1989. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> did not say which administration official he contacted concerning the <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> letter, but it has been reported that <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was instrumental in toning down criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in the Economic Report of the President issued last week. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, in a separate appearance Wednesday before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that while he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had been too stingy in supplying money to the economy last year, things have improved in the past six weeks. `` Since that time, we've been delighted with monetary policy,'' <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said. `` They're dedicated to a policy of moderate expansion. ... They have the power to do it, and I'm confident they will do it.''

 Grammy Goose met Granny Goose in court on Tuesday to decide an issue that has ruffled a lot of feathers. <ORGANIZATION> Granny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has accused the Grammy Goose Baby Boutique of `` diluting'' the food company's name and logo. <PERSON> Granny </PERSON> has asked for a preliminary injunction against Grammy. <PERSON> Granny </PERSON> <PERSON> Goose </PERSON>, the nation's third largest potato chip manufacturer, is arguing the boutique in nearby <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION> has created confusion by using a similar name. The name and logo `` represent the most valuable asset my client owns,'' Granny attorney <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Sonoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehden </PERSON>. `` Where there is confusion, dilution has occurred.'' <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotelli </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION> grandmother who owns the baby shop, said she'll be forced out of business if the injunction is granted. She said she picked the name by combining her liking for geese with her granddaughter's nickname for her. Ms. <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> told the court the company made a three-point offer to Grammy Goose: to help design a new sign, to help phase out printed paper goods and to help find a new name that retains part of the current name. `` We understand she is a small business and we would like to mitigate the harm to her,'' Ms. <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said. She acknowledged there had `` not been a great decrease in sales,'' but said the case had resulted in negative publicity for the corporation. The judge gave Mrs. <PERSON> Gotelli </PERSON> one week to respond in writing to the points made by Ms. <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Granny </PERSON> <PERSON> Goose </PERSON>'s attorneys then will have another five days to respond.

<HEAD>United Sued Over Computer Reservations System</HEAD>

 System One <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Access </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> affiliate that markets a computer reservations system to travel agents, filed an antitrust lawsuit Tuesday against <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which runs a rival system. System One described in its complaint a pattern of actions undertaken by Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> since 1984 to inhibit competition and unfairly preserve market dominance. The lawsuit, filed in a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> federal court, says that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s action also violated regulations adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, which prohibit airlines that own a System One computer reservations system from directly or indirectly prohibiting travel agents from obtaining or using another system. The anticompetitive actions undertaken by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, according to the lawsuit, include rollover requirements, which extend the contract for a new five-year term every time the agent adds new equipment or services and punitive damages clauses based on future airline booking fees, which may amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars in the event an agent switches systems. The lawsuit also alleges that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' contractural clauses prevent travel agents from using additional systems and the filings of lawsuits against individual travel agencies that select an alternative computer system vendor. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonring </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, said he was aware of the lawsuit but would not comment further. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> airlines. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, through an affiliated company called <ORGANIZATION> Covia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, operates Apollo, the second largest computerized reservation system in the country behind <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION>, affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. System One is third.
