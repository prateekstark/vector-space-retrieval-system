<TEXT>
 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Tuesday that the superpowers should renounce military intervention in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and make the region a zone of peace. Addressing the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, he also emphasized that Soviet-style reforms are not a universal remedy for other communist countries, including <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` We do not regard our approaches and solutions as some universal prescription for all,'' he said in what appeared an attempt to minimize the difference between <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s orthodox communism and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s new pragmatism. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> opposes the `` export of revolution or counterrevolution,'' referring to both Cuban and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But he also reaffirmed that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will continue supplying weaponry to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government as long as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to arm other Central American countries. The issue remains a major sore point in relations between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> both said they had not had a chance to review <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said his comment on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was `` the same old line they've been pushing.'' There had been speculation that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a gesture of friendship toward <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, might announce forgiveness of part or all of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s debt to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But he barely mentioned the subject, merely restating his position that the industrialized nations of the world should try to help ease the burden of debtor nations in the developing world. Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, in a 50-minute introduction that was only three minutes shorter than his guest's address, lambasted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a characteristic diatribe. He blamed his longtime adversary for regional conflicts throughout the world and for `` pulling the Third World's leg'' by proposing unworkable solutions to the critical problem of Third World debt. Waving his arms and jabbing his fingers, the 62-year-old <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> rejected suggestions of friction in Soviet-Cuban relations. He said he was in full agreement with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s contention that each communist country must solve the problems of developing socialism in its own way. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who had been expected to outline Soviet policy toward <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, essentially reiterated his government's longstanding view that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> holds the key to peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and must halt its intervention in order to encourage settlement of regional strife. `` We have a real possiblity of guaranteeing peace,'' he said, but all sides must halt military supplies to the region. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> does not seek for itself political, strategic or military advantage in the Western hemisphere,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` We consider that this hemisphere and all others must not be an arena for <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> confrontation.'' In proposing establishment of a `` zone of peace,'' the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> president said his country `` does not have any intention of having in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> naval, air or missile bases or to place there nuclear or other weapons of mass extermination.'' He called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries to adopt a similar approach to continue the transformation of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into a region of peace, security and stability. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> are principal suppliers of the Sandinista regime in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provides nonmilitary aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels and weaponry to the Salvadoran government, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and other nations Soviet sources predicted before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that the Soviet leader would try to persuade <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to extract <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> from involvement in leftist struggles around the world and concentrate on building the Cuban economy, which after three decades of socialism is still heavily reliant on Soviet aid. `` We are resolutely opposed to any theories and doctrines justifying the export of revolution or counterrevolution, all forms of foreign interference in the affairs of sovereign states,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in his speech. He made similar statements after the speech at a news conference, saying that `` power policies have totally discedited themselves.'' Earlier, in an interview with the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested that he and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> are prepared to work for improved East-West relations, indicating some softening in the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader's rigid anti-Americanism. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> a central topic of his talks with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> on Monday was the `` new thinking'' in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> foreign policy _ an approach that seeks to ease world tensions by reducing military commitments abroad and negotiating settlements of regional disputes that threaten to bring the superpowers into conflict. It is a tenet of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies at home that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must demonstrate to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> it is eager to serve as a cooperative partner in world economic development and dispel the Kremlin's `` enemy image'' of the Cold War era. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed a 25-year accord the Cuban news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said dashes all speculation about a rift between <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and ratifies their `` traditional relations.'' But despite a show of friendship between he two communist allies, a series of arrests in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> on Tuesday underscored the differences between the pragmatic liberalism espoused by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the tight control still exercised by <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> 30 years after he led a guerrilla army to victory over a right-wing dictatorship. Police rounded up seven dissidents who were planning a demonstration Tuesday evening in support of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. Among those detained was <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, according to government and dissident spokesmen. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> condemned the arrests, saying they underscore `` the need for ongoing monitoring of the human rights situation in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>20 Years After Transplant, Cooley Says Ethics, Regulations Hinder
Advances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF AWALT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty years after he performed the world's first implant of an artificial heart into a human, Dr. <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> on Tuesday said further medical advances have been hindered by ethical doubts and regulatory interference. Despite the difficulties, <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> said on the anniversary of the operation that he expects still greater achievements over the next 20 years. `` The heart is truly a remarkable organ and developing a perfect substitute is going to be a challenge not only for this generation, but for generations of researchers to come,'' <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> said. `` Research institutions and investigators throughout the world are challenged by this project, and I think that we will see an acceptable, totally implantable permanent device within the next 15 to 20 years.'' It was April 4, 1969, when <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> and his associates at the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> implanted a totally artificial heart into the chest of <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON> <PERSON> Karp </PERSON>, a 47-year-old printing estimator from <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> lived for three days on the device and then received a human heart transplant but died a day later when infection and tissue rejection set in <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> had first attempted a surgical repair of <PERSON> Karp </PERSON>'s heart, but the organ was too badly damaged and it was clear he would not survive, the doctor said. `` This was the first time that we decided we were n't going to pull the plug, but that we were going to give this man that remote chance of survival,'' <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> said. The first heart transplant had been performed less than two years before. The proven human use of an artificial heart _ which earlier had shown promise in research animals _ elated the surgical team but drew a harsh reaction from some medical professionals and the public. <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> was censured by the <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for `` publicity,'' which meant violating the society's guidelines about having a physician's name appear in a newspaper in connection with the name of a patient. `` All the theoretical objections really almost killed the transplant program; that, coupled with the high incidence of tissue rejection, which brought a lot of bad news to the profession,'' <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> said. Since then, however, the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine came into use and advanced artificial hearts have improved survival until donor hearts can be found. And greater public acceptance has made donor organs more plentiful. However, new obstacles have emerged, including burdensome federal regulations that limit the application of medical research, said Dr. O.H. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, who directs the cardiovascular surgical research lab at the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not sure today if that first step was n't taken in 1969 how we would take it today,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> agrees that regulations make research applications more difficult today, but he believes the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is not directly to blame. `` I know that the individuals at the -LRB- FDA -RRB- who are responsible for these restrictions are people who are well motivated, but they are responding basically to what the public seems to want,'' <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> said. `` I do n't believe we ought to live in a completely unregulated society, but I think that our restrictions should be liberal enough that progress can be made.''

 <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> is a seasoned veteran of the performing arts who remembers his acting debut as anything but auspicious. `` I grew up in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and started acting as a senior in high school,'' he recalls. `` The very first play I did I blew my lines. I heard my cue, walked on stage and repeated the cue. I could n't remember my line. `` I muddled around and then got off stage as fast as I could. It did n't deter me from pursuing this wonderfully capricious business.'' <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> started work on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' night-time soap opera `` Falcon Crest,'' his eighth television series, in December. He plays <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, a wealthy businessman who becomes involved in tricky dealings with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Pilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kristian </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> -RRB-. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> -RRB- is teaming up with <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> to stop her son -LRB- <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> -RRB- from industrializing the <LOCATION> Tuscany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and taking over the winery,'' he said. `` They were talking abut my character before I even showed up. After I was cast I watched the show to see what they were saying about <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON>. They knew I was coming even before I knew I was coming.'' <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> had only a two-day rest before starting on `` Falcon Crest'' after completing seven months on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> daytime soap `` General Hospital'' as the `` mysterious stranger'' in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>. `` I was a wealthy developer who ran for the state assembly on ` General Hospital,''' he said. `` I was married but running around with <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeman </PERSON>. I was n't a heavy, just a guy in an unhappy marriage. I fell for <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, but after I won the election I went off to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> and tried to settle with my wife.'' His first professional role was as a football player in an episode of `` Naked City,'' which he got because of his prowess as a college basketball and track and field performer. He'd been lifting weights and looked the part. `` I was only in it for a second,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> were the stars of the episode. I kept a photo copy of the check for $ 24 that I received.'' His first regular role was the soap opera `` Love of Life,'' which he starred on for 2 -LCB- years. Next, he spent six years on `` Edge of Night.'' At the same time, he starred in a Broadway revival of `` A Streetcar Named Desire.'' He was also on `` Search for Tomorrow,'' but only for a very brief time. Next, he was <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Warden </PERSON>'s detective partner in `` Jigsaw <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' then had a role in `` Looking for Mr. <PERSON> Goodbar </PERSON>.'' His other series were `` The Runaways,'' `` Family Tree'' and `` Berrenger's.'' <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> also starred in numerous other movies. He was a Zealot warrior in the miniseries `` <LOCATION> Masada </LOCATION>.'' He was a gay football player in `` Alexander: The Other Side of Dawn.'' He was an ex-con in PBS' `` Visions. He's never acted in a Western, though he did play <PERSON> Wild </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickock </PERSON> on stage in `` Fathers and Sons.'' `` As a kid I never watched the cartoons,'' he said. `` I watched Lash LaRue, ` Range Rider,' Crash <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> and ` Rough Riders.' I did a lot of daydreaming and play-acting. At the age of 7 my ambition was to be a cowboy in the movies.'' <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>, who spends his off hours painting, has some of his work on display at a local gallery. `` I paint in acrylics, and my work tends to look like a collage,'' he said. `` I paint objects that tend to be three-dimensional.''

 The disaster expert whose crew saved two <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> towns from last summer's <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> firestorms now is plotting to defend another national park against the largest oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. `` Our mission is to find out where the marine wildlife and sea birds are today, then set priorities so the oil that kills them can try to be contained,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON>, a veteran <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> troubleshooter whose title is incident commander. <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON>'s team has found similarities here to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> we put firefighters on the ground. Here we're providing logistics for Ph.D. biologists who we're handling as a very intelligent resource, very delicately If they need a boat we get one, if they need a ham sandwich we make one. What they need we try to provide,'' <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON> said. The tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> hit a reef near <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> on Good Friday night and bled 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Huge fingers of the slick are now extending westward through <LOCATION> Montague </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> toward the 660,501-acre Kenai Fjord National Park. The oil was less than 10 miles offshore from <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION> on Sunday night, but calm seas and gentle breezes made its future course unpredictable. `` It's possible it could miss everything here,'' said <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON>, `` but to ignore it would be totally negligent. Knowing what we do, we have to prepare to mitigate it.'' Created by the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, the new national park is a necklace of bird rookeries, tidal pools, and whale playgrounds draped along 610 miles of the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>'s eastern coastline. Located 100 air miles southeast of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, most of the park can be reached only by floatplane or boat. It attracted fewer than 60,000 hardy tourists last year, and is more hospitable to its critters than its visitors. Among the animals who cavort in the midnight sun amid the rugged grandeur of the park's coves and inlets are many endangered Humpback and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales, a few endangered Fin whales, and otters, sea lions, and seals. <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON> is in charge of a 40-member-and-growing team of pilots, support personnel, and environmental experts drawn from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> agencies, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Although <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON>'s home is Fairbanks, he was at a meeting of the government's 18 Class 1 disaster incident commanders in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, when his permanent eight-man core unit was activated at the request of the park service. `` The last time we were together was <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, on the Storm Creek fire,'' said <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON>. `` We did n't expect to see each other again until summer.'' Last August and September, he was boss to several thousand civilian and military firefighters who faced down 200-foot walls of flame threatening to incinerate Silver Gate and <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. The two towns were saved but <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s fires charred nearly one million acres. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the team's planning chief, said the spill `` woke us all up and got us ready for the year. It looks like it could be a long one.'' The team set up shop in a small house near park headquarters in <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION>. Up went the topographical maps. In came the photocopy machine, typewriters, and coffeemaker. Seven phone lines now ring constantly from dawn until midnight. `` An oil slick is like a fire line, it just keeps moving,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>.

 A group of leading Latin American writers, artists and scholars has told President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> he will bear `` historical responsibility'' for continued destruction of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest. `` We believe that the historical responsibility for destroying the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle is very great, and future generations of Latin Americans will not forgive it if everything possible is not done to avoid it,'' the Group of 100 warned un a letter, which was released Monday. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> has rejected international criticism of the deforestation of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> basin as foreign interference in <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> affairs. The Group of 100 declared that `` to invoke national sovereignty to justify crimes against nature _ like those being committed against one of the richest and most complex ecosystems on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> _ appears puerile and dishonest to us.''

 The Museum of State Security displays the scorched tail of a small plane, plastic explosives, a tattered 2506 Brigade armband, assault rifles, a radio transmitter and a battered water can with a label in English. The artifacts are part of what <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> presents as its 30-year struggle with the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and dissident Cubans accused of trying to kill or overthrow President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. The museum, which opened this weekend, occupies a refurbished mansion in a once-wealthy neighborhood whose villas now house embassies or government offices. In a small plaza visible from the street, a power boat with a black hull, sea blue decks and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> markings looks at first glance like a private plaything in a country where such luxuries are rare. Closer examination reveals that the boat, driven by powerful Mercury engines, has heavy machine guns mounted fore and aft. <PERSON> Octavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, the clean-cut, graying guide at the museum, said the vessel made coastal raids until it was captured by agents of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s special police force. Maps inside the museum are dotted with sites of `` imperialist aggression,'' a battle plan for the U.S.-sponsored Bay of Pigs debacle in 1961. There are a rogue's gallery of people accused of trying to kill <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and relics of what is portrayed as a secret war on the regime he established 30 years ago. At the center of an upstairs room, in its own sealed plexiglas case, is a three-volume set of the yellow-bound proceedings of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> investigation of 1975. The committee investigation disclosed bungled <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> attempts on <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s life _ once with an exploding cigar, for instance, and another time with poison powder that supposedly was scattered on the leader's clothing but did no harm. Asked why the evidence was not displayed, <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> first said, `` There have been so many attempts they could n't all be put in the museum.'' Later, he said he was n't sure the evidence still existed. He led the visitors into the Hall of Martyrs, lined with portraits of 88 agents of State Security described as having died fighting the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> exiles, counterrevolutionaries or other enemies. A brass plaque beneath each portrait gave the details. <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> said the museum's purpose `` is to bring to the people a cultural identity and to transmit a story for all visitors fundamentally about a fight and the atrocities carried out against us, and the aggressions of the last century.'' Asked why a meseum opened now to depict events of the 1960s, <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> said: `` The opportunity is now'' and, in the past, `` the revolution had other priorities.'' In first room of the museum are a giant photo of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> landing at <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1898, during the Spanish-American War, and a huge copy of a letter written in 1895 by <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, patron saint of Cuban independence. <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would `` continue to use <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as a base to extend its power into the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>.'' The only other exhibit in that room is an enlargement of a letter <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> wrote in 1958, from a camp in the hills, telling his longtime friend and secretary <PERSON> Celia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>: `` They're firing rockets at us in the mountains. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> was killed, and the Americans will pay dearly for this.'' He also wrote, just a year before gaining power: `` It's becoming clear to me that this war will go on much longer. It will have to go on against the Americans.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> apologized and promised compensation for causing the nation's biggest oil spill, which on Monday forced <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to shut down its $ 12 million herring fishery in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> for the season. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state police, meanwhile, said they expected the surrender Tuesday of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, the former captain of the tanker that spilled 10.1 million gallons of North Slope crude after it crashed into <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on March 24. `` We have reason to believe he'll present himself'' at the state police barracks in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Farmingdale </LOCATION>, said state police spokesman Trooper <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON> in a telephone interview Monday evening. An arrest warrant has been issued in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Hazelwood </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, resident is accused of misdemeanor charges of operating a ship while under the influence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. The oil slick has now grown larger than <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The state Fish and Game Department announced Monday that the Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> herring fishery, which generates $ 12 million in annual revenues, will not open this year. Officials have previously closed the sound's sablefish and shrimp fisheries. More than half the spawning habitat used by Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> herring has been fouled, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Haanpaa </PERSON>, a fisheries biologist with the department. That bodes ill for both the fish and the fishermen, who tend to catch herring near their spawning ground. Altogether, the Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> fishing industry is worth more than $ 150 million annually. In full-page advertisements placed in newspapers around the country Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said, `` I want to tell you how sorry I am that this accident took place.'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON>'s statement also appeared to respond to harsh criticism from Alaskan officials, fishermen and environmentalists who accuse <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> of reacting slowly and inadequately to the spill. `` We believe that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has moved swiftly and competently to minimize the effect this oil will have on the environment, fish and other wildlife,'' he said. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> also offered to `` meet our obligations to all those who have suffered damage from the spill.'' Four class action lawsuits already have been filed against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> at the outset of what could be years of litigation over the accident. In an interview from the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said he hopes the `` emotional type of atmosphere'' generated by the spill does not prompt <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reject the oil industry's request to drill in protected wildlife areas. However, that could be precisely the outcome of the spill, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> suggested in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` If the image of an uncareful and uncaring industry prevails among the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public, then we can kiss goodbye the domestic oil and gas development in -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, offshore and in the public lands,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said. More than 1,000 seabirds and at least 20 sea otters caught in the oil have died, some found covered with asphalt-hard oil. Officials said the death toll is probably much higher, but they have had time to survey only a slice of the sound's 2,500 miles of coastline. Department of Fish and Game spokesman <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> said Monday a deer found dead on <LOCATION> Naked </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> about 25 miles southwest of the tanker had apparently eaten contaminated food, an indication of how rapidly the spill was spreading. `` That's bad news. That's the top of the food chain,'' <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> said. On nearby <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, hundreds of birds lay along the beach, as black and lifeless as the oil-smeared rocks around them. Sheltered coves and rocky points, usually clamoring with the sound of gulls and other shorebirds, were silent. `` Every day, it's getting a little worse,'' otter rescue specialist <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON> said as he squatted by a dead sea duck. `` You clean a beach up, the tide changes, and the oil comes right back.'' Oil is so thick that walking on once postcard-perfect beaches is treacherous, and workers wear hardhats to protect against injuries from frequent tumbles on rocks. Oil sprayed by waves splatters rocks and driftwood logs high above the tideline. Beaches smell like gas station garages. In <LOCATION> Sawmill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, 11 miles west of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, fishermen said Monday they battling to keep oil away from 2 million salmon at a hatchery. A sheen of oil has worked its way inside a plastic boom stretched across the bay, they said. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials have conceded that beach cleanup efforts so far have been futile. But the company said it began a new assault with more effective gear, more workers and a floating command post. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> planned to flush beaches by pumping seawater over them, then collect oil from the water with skimmers `` We intend not to leave until the job is done,'' <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said. `` We intend to leave <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> close to what it was before the tragedy.'' State officials have blasted <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to scrub beaches as dismal and ineffective. Less than 4 percent of the thick crude has been recovered. The spill has fouled more than 800 miles of shoreline in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, and the amount grows each day. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> last week. The skipper admitted drinking before boarding the Exxon Valdez, according to court documents. Blood and urine samples taken nine hours after the accident indicated he was drunk. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, director of criminal prosecution for the state of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, said authorities in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> have had communication with a lawyer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> representing <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>. The tanker accident forced reductions in the flow of oil through the Alaskan pipeline, which carries nearly one-quarter of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' domestic supply of crude oil. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the flow was increased Sunday evening with word from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> that tanker traffic would soon be allowed to return to normal. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> decided Monday to reinstate daytime-only restrictions on oil tanker traffic in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> after state officials raised concerns, spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Meidt </PERSON> said. Night traffic was allowed Sunday for the first time since the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, one of the two largest tankers in <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet, ran aground. But after a Monday meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> decided to again limit traffic until all agencies are satisfied that <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION>, the operator of the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> terminal, has the equipment to handle another spill, <PERSON> Meidt </PERSON> said. `` If something were to happen, let's make sure we have enough gear there to respond,'' he said. The pipeline usually carries 2 million barrels of crude a day. That had been reduced to 800,000 barrels a day, causing shortages at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> refineries and sending oil prices higher. By Monday morning, the pipeline flow had been increased to 1.3 million barrels a day, spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratterman </PERSON> said. Pipeline company officials said they did n't expect the latest restrictions in tanker traffic to force another cutback in flow.

<TEXT>
 A barge carrying 160,000 gallons of lye capsized on the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Monday, and authorities were trying to salvage the craft without a major spill, state and federal officials said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said small amounts of a 50 percent lye solution, also known as sodium hydroxide or caustic soda, could be seeping through vents in the barge. `` Common sense tells us, you assume there's some seepage,'' said Lt. Commander <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` But none has been detected. Because of its high alkalinity, lye is considered a hazardous chemical that could endanger aquatic life and drinking water, officials said. The barge, owned by <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was one of 15 being transported by a tugboat around a sharp bend in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bottom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Murraysville </PERSON>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> It broke away from the other vessels and drifted close to the rocky shore before running aground between <LOCATION> Parkersburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ravenswood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said. The outer shell of the 195-foot barge was punctured by a rock shortly before 9 a.m. Monday, <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said. The space between the two hulls flooded and the barge capsized. <ORGANIZATION> Kemron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, company hired by <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> Monday to monitor the incident, did not detect an alkalinity increase in the water surrounding the barge. `` It would almost take a catastrophic release to pose a major threat,'' <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said. In high concentrations such as the barge is carrying, lye will burn skin and eyes, <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said. Swallowing it can be dangerous, he said. `` Drinking water could be infected, so water intake users downstream have been notified,'' he said. The cleanup and removal of the barge is expected to take several weeks. PPG's salvage expert from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, was to arrive early Tuesday, <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said.

 The capital is awash in laughing daffodils, a grand chorus of tulips is about to proclaim the arrival of spring, and <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Boston </PERSON> already is worrying about planting thousands of geraniums, petunias and marigolds for the summer. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> is chief floral gardener for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the generalissimo with rake and hoe who oversees the year-long planting of 170 flower beds from the Capitol to the Kennedy Center. His job might seem staggering to backyard putterers. For a month in late fall, the efficient, unflappable <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and his crew of eight gardeners were busy planting 186,150 tulips, 108,300 daffodils and 22,000 pansies, all of which bloom in the spring. Those flowers are removed by early May. The soil is tilled, fumigated with weed and pest killers, conditioned with perlite and peat moss and planted with bright, hardy annuals for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s hot summer months They are weeded and fertilized until they die in the first frost. They are replaced by about 3,000 crysanthemums. Then the beds are cleared and the cycle starts again in November. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, a 26-year <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> veteran, is especially proud of the `` tulip library,'' a broad, looping cluster of 95 small beds of the proud clarions of spring that lies near the <LOCATION> Tidal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> south of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument. This elaborate garden contains 15,000 tulips, most of them imported from <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. Each of the 95 beds containing a different variety, with names as dazzling as their colors _ Queen of Night, Merry Widow, <LOCATION> Apeldoorn </LOCATION>, Oriental Splendor, Smiling Queen, Flaming Parrot, <PERSON> Estella </PERSON> <PERSON> Rijnveld </PERSON>. It's so impressive that it won an admiring tribute from the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> says he gets `` great satisfaction'' from his handiwork, which delights more than 23 million tourists who visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s national parks and monuments each year `` This is always what I wanted to do,'' said <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, 45, who grew up on his father's farm in eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and migrated to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after high school. `` All my life I've been used to growing things.'' His annual $ 330,000 budget includes the cost of plants and bulbs purchased wholesale from growers, many from neighboring <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, on the basis of competitive bids and shipped into the capital by truck or van. During plantings, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s crew begins work at 6 a.m. and can leave a flower bed blazing with color before the morning rush hour is over. He says he could n't meet his grueling timetable for the passing seasons without his eight <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> helpers. `` They really work hard and do a good job,'' he said. `` They're all gardeners, and they know what they're doing They can plant 20,000 bulbs in one day.'' In a city beset by violent crimes, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> is pleased that his flowers are almost never stolen, except by an occasional panhandler intent on selling them for spare change. `` I guess people enjoy them so, they do n't take them,'' he said. `` About the only problem is when people stand in the beds to pose for pictures and mash the flowers down.'' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> says he once had `` the best-looking yard in the neighborhood'' in suburban <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where he lives with his wife and two children, `` but in this job, I do n't have the time any more to take care of it.'' His loss is <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s gain.

 The government says it will force <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to take stricter anti-terrorism measures, but people who lost loved ones in the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 say the actions are n't strong enough. On the 103rd day after the bombing, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced orders requiring devices to detect plastic explosives and stricter compliance with aviation security warnings, after Flight 103 relatives met with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The White House meeting on Monday, which was scheduled for 20 minutes but lasted an hour, began a day of emotion-filled activities at nearby <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> church by scores of relatives and friends of the 270 people killed in the Dec. 21 explosion of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The relatives called for a full-scale congressional investigation `` to determine what and where the breakdowns were'' that led to the `` preventable massacre at 31,000 feet.'' <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Demarest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, spokesman for the relatives, said action announced by <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was `` a positive step forward. We applaud the secretary, -LRB- but -RRB- it's not enough. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was in the meeting with the relatives and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON> said all checked and carried baggage should be hand-searched until devices are installed that can detect plastic explosives such as the one believed to have blown up Flight 103 as it was headed from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The relatives also proposed better training and pay for airport inspectors and public disclosure of terrorist threats. `` Our loved ones were not given the freedom to make a rational decision regarding their fate based on all the available facts,'' <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON> said. `` We realize that we will never again be able to laugh, cry or talk with our loved ones,'' he told several hundred people in the park. `` But we are determined to do everything in our power to prevent this senseless and preventable tragedy from occurring again.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, at a news conference, outlined new orders affecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, including required installation of plastic explosive-detection systems, such as thermal neutron analysis devices, at high-risk airport throughout the world `` at the earliest feasible date.'' The government already has ordered six of the nearly $ 1 million machines for installation at various airports before the end of the year, but <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> gave no timetable for carrying out the new order, which would involve 100 or more airports. He said it will require some negotiations with foreign governments. A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity said it could take years for full compliance with the order. Other steps ordered by <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> include mandatory airline acknowledgement and compliance with security bulletins that warn of possible threats against aviation, an increase in <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> personnel assigned to key <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign airports and upgrading of airport X-ray equipment. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, however, said a public warning system when there are security threats, saying it would cripple intelligence efforts to combat terrorists. `` We must balance the needs of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and the industry to know with the need to gather meaningful, significant, relevant information,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told relatives he would look into the possibility of a unified congressional investigation into the explosion. But <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he would recommend against. He said government response has been adequate and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard are capable of solving the crime. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, said it supported <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s initiatives, but spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> said the airlines believe the government, not the airlines, should pay for new detection equipment from the growing Aviation Trust Fund. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> estimated fares might increase from 20 cents to a dollar per ticket but said the requirements would not cause serious delays. The association said any increased security measures should also apply to foreign airlines which carry about half of the Americans traveling abroad.

<HEAD>Land Values in Midwest Were Stable Despite Ravages of Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist says federal emergency aid `` probably helped stabilize land values in the Midwest'' last year after drought ravaged crops across the region. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that surveys by the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, indicate that land prices did not decline in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> in June through November last year. Other surveys indicate that farmland prices rose in the Corn Belt in 1988, he said. Real estate is the main source of loan collateral for farmers. `` While drought assistance has helped stabilize the agricultural economy, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 10,000 to 15,000 commercial farms faced loan repayment problems due to crop losses,'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. `` These stressed farmers represent 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent of all commercial farms.'' The Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 was signed into law last Aug. 11 as the scorching summer drought was still at its peak. The law provided up to $ 3.9 billion in federal aid and other measures to help farmers recover. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, writing in the April issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, said that federal disaster assistance may turn out to be less than foreseen last fall `` because crop losses were smaller than expected.'' `` Also, qualification for drought assistance was based on the whole-farm average yield for each crop, rather than on a field-by-field basis,'' he said. `` The averaging-up of yields, where good fields offset poorer fields, excluded some farmers from qualifying in areas with scattered rainfall.'' Even so, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> added, the combination of drought assistance and federal subsidized crop insurance `` has permitted thousands of farmers in hard-hit states to survive last year's bad weather with less financial suffering than had been anticipated.'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said a full assessment of federal drought aid and insurance benefits can not be completed until all payments and indemnities have been disbursed. But preliminary figures show those had `` substantial stabilizing effects'' in the hardest-hit drought areas. But on Capitol Hill there have been grumblings that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has mishandled 1988 relief and has ignored drought conditions now prevailing in parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, notably in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Department officials testified that more than 558,000 producers had received disaster payments and emergency feed assistance amounting to more than $ 2.7 billion nationally. In his report, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said that as of early February, more than $ 2 billion in drought payments and almost $ 1 billion in federal crop insurance benefits had been paid to farmers in the top eight states. Farmers in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> _ where more than 80 percent of the commercial farms were in drought-stricken counties _ have received nearly a third of the drought payments made so far. Benefits paid to the eight states as of early February, in millions of dollars, included drought aid in the first column, federal crop insurance in the second, and the total in the third:

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dry bean situation has `` completely reversed'' itself from a year ago because of higher prices prompted by the 1988 drought. By January, the average farm price of dry edible beans was $ 29.60 per hundredweight, up from $ 13.40 a year earlier. Price increases were the greatest for beans hit hardest by the drought. For example, grower prices for navy beans in the week of Jan. 24 averaged $ 32 per hundredweight, compared with around $ 10 in January 1988, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> output of dry beans dropped 26 percent to 19.2 million hundredweight last year, the agency reported. `` The sharpest decreases in production were for red kidney, pintos and navies, the beans grown in states with less irrigation,'' the report said. Another price factor is an improved outlook for bean exports because of poor harvests in several major importing countries, including <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Domestic demand for beans could also improve this year because of recent media attention and industry promotional efforts,'' the report said. Beans are a nutritious food item and are noted for their fiber content.

<HEAD>Cornell Says Ethics, Not Security, The Key to Preventing Computer
Worms</HEAD>

 Ethics, not increased security, are the best defense against computer `` worms'' like the one unleashed last fall by a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student, a school official said. A special university commission reported Monday that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> acted alone and with `` reckless disregard'' on Nov. 2 when he launched a debilitating program into the Internet network, causing thousands of computers around the country to clog and overload. The commission concluded that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> did not intend for the worm to destroy data or files, but that he did want it to spread widely. It said the program was not technically a `` virus'' _ a program that inserts itself into a host program to propagate _ but was a `` worm,'' an independent program that replicates itself once placed in a computer system. Release of the worm was not a `` heroic event that pointed up the weaknesses of operating systems,'' contrary to <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' claim, the commission wrote. The panel also denied that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was a genius for creating the worm. It said although the worm was technically sophisticated, it could have been created by many students. In fact, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' `` juvenile act'' did little to provide insights into the already well-known security flaws of the Internet system, a national research network used by universities, industry and government, said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of technologies. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> Provost <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said the incident's greatest impact was the breach of trust it had caused among researchers who use the network However, both cautioned that employing drastic security steps was not a solution to prevent similar incidents. `` Violations of such a trust can not be condoned,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>. `` A community of scholars should n't have to build sky-high walls in order to protect a reasonable expectation of privacy _ particularly when such walls would impede the free flow of information and ideas.'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> added that it's unlikely any security steps could guarantee an impenetrable system `` in a community of individuals possessed of all the knowledge and skills required to scale the highest barriers.'' Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> officials stressed the need for improved awareness of computer ethics, said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>. `` I do n't think one can ever feel confident by putting bigger and tighter locks on the door,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>. `` That's why it's important to stress ethical considerations. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who is on a leave of absence from school, declined to be interviewed by the commission, which was left to speculate as to the reasons he created the `` worm.'' The panel made no recommendation about disciplinary action against the first-year graduate student in <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s doctoral computer program. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' case would be reviewed by a panel of graduate students and faculty that could permanently bar him from the university. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 23, of <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, remains under investigation by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The expanding shipboard set that dominates <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Britten </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>'' at the Metropolitan Opera is so spectacular that the work would almost be worth reviving just for the chance to see it in action. Luckily, there was also quite a bit of a musical nature to hold the interest Monday night when the company presented the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> production for the first time in several seasons. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Melville </PERSON>'s classic tale revolves around three sharply drawn characters who inspired some of <PERSON> Britten </PERSON>'s most memorable music: <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, the good and handsome sailor; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Claggart </PERSON>, the evil master-at-arms who is bent on his destruction; and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vere </PERSON>, the philosophical captain who reluctantly sends <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> to his death to preserve law and order. Two of the three roles were in excellent hands. Baritone <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> made a first-rate <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>, conveying first his youth and enthusiasm and later his pathos when, chained and awaiting execution, he sings a haunting ballad. As Vere, tenor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> made a moving figure, especially in the prologue and epilogue where he appears as an old man musing about the distant past. Another composer might have made <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> a tenor, the vocal part traditionally associated with a young hero. But in <LOCATION> Melville </LOCATION>'s ambiguous narrative, Captain Vere may be the real hero, and <PERSON> Britten </PERSON>'s decision to make him the tenor seems to acknowledge this The malevolent <PERSON> Claggart </PERSON> is portrayed more conventionally as a deep bass. <PERSON> Jan-Hendrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Rootering </PERSON> looked sinister enough, but his good-sized voice lacked the bite and menace that <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> brought to the part when the production was new. The men's chorus, which has a major role in the all-male cast, performed lustily, and the orchestra played well under conductor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>. But it was above all the set, designed by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, that commanded admiration. With the aid of the Met's elaborate system of stage elevators, the ship expands and shrinks like an accordion as the action shifts from the main-deck, to the captain's cabin, to the quarter-deck, to the lower gun-deck. The effect is fittingly to make the ship itself the dominant image in the opera, a microcosm where the battle between good and evil is played out to its tragic conclusion.

 Opponents of capital punishment are pressing <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> to block the extradition of a juvenile sought by <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> until he's assured the youth wo n't face the death penalty But <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> so far has refused to interject himself publicly into the extradition case involving a 17-year-old black youth charged in the May 1988 firebombing of a <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, apartment. A 14-month-old black child died in the fire. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, the mayor's deputy press secretary, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> would not respond to pleas, made at a Monday news conference by a group of death penalty opponents and church leaders, that he refuse to honor <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s extradition request unless state authorities guarantee the youth, identified by the initials <LOCATION> O.M. </LOCATION>, will not be charged with a capital crime. While <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has remained silent, lawyers for the district government have supported <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s bid to extradite the youth, who has been held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since his arrest in December on a fugitive warrant from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eilperin </PERSON> last week granted <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s extradition request, but he stayed his order until today to allow the youth's attorneys to appeal. An appeal was filed Friday with the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which extended the stay until April 10. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronstein </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> can supersede the court ruling and block the extradition until <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> promises not to seek the death penalty. <PERSON> Bronstein </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, by allowing his government to support the extradition, has `` forgotten the values that motivated him 25 years ago'' when he worked for racial justice in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nonviolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SNCC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. <PERSON> Bronstein </PERSON>, who was an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> SNCC </ORGANIZATION> members during the civil rights movement, said he was issuing `` a personal plea to the mayor ... do n't send this youngster back without the kinds of guarantees that will ensure us that he wo n't be killed in jail, that he will be treated in a decent fashion and that he wo n't face the death penalty.'' If <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> refuses to make such guarantees, then <PERSON> Bronstein </PERSON> said the district should release the youth, because there are no other outstanding charges against him. O.M.'s attorneys contend he can not get a fair trial from the white authorities of <LOCATION> Etowah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, because of their long-standing vendetta against his family. Both the boy's father and uncle died while in police custody. Another of the boy's uncles has been charged with murder and arson in connection with the 1988 firebombing. O.M. is charged under juvenile law as an accessory to the firebombing, and thus is not facing an immediate threat of the death penalty. But <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> authorities have refused to rule out the possiblity that he might be tried as an adult and subjected to the death penalty.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scoffs at the notion that his season-opening pitch to <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>' catcher <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Tettleton </PERSON> was a high and wide. `` He caught it before it started breaking,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> protests. With guest Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and a sellout Memorial Stadium crowd of 52,161 watching, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tossed the first ball in Monday's American League opener between <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, captain of the 1948 <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> baseball team and an enthusistic lifetime fan, threw the ball lefthanded from the mound. Standing in his shirtsleeves with his jacket removed and a glove on his right hand, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hurled the ball without benefit of a windup. <PERSON> Tettleton </PERSON>, who had moved several feet in front of home plate for the presidential pitch, gloved the curve ball with a long reach over his right shoulder. Over hot dogs, hamburgers and soft drinks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed that pitch _ his first game-opener as president _ with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and other guests and reporters in his glass-enclosed box over third base, voicing mock dismay over a reporter's suggestion that it was `` high and outside.'' Turning to baseball great <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> friend, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Here's an objective judge. What did you think, sir?'' After a pause, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said: `` High, hard, fast ball.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then asked `` another objective visitor,'' baseball commissioner <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>. `` Superb,'' <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> said, adding he had n't seen the pitch but had heard about it from Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who `` said it was wonderful.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Muburak </PERSON> left after the fifth inning, when <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> led 1-0, missing most of the action. The final score was <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> 5, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> 4 in 11 innings. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, putting on an <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> hat for photogrpahers, said he was enjoying both his hot dog lunch and his first live baseball game, calling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` a very good teacher.'' `` He was the captain of the biggest team in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. `` That's what I told him,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> interjected.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Use of Drug Courier `Profiles'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Law enforcement officials are armed with new support from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to fight drug smuggling by air travelers. The justices on Monday made it easier for authorities to stop, question and search airline passengers who fit so-called `` profiles'' of possible drug couriers. By a 7-2 vote, the court ordered the reinstatement of a drug possession conviction of a man carrying 1,000 grams of cocaine when he was stopped by authorities at the <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> airport. `` We're pleased and happy that we've been upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The justices upheld the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s case against <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolow </PERSON>, who was stopped because his behavior and dress matched a `` profile'' the agency uses to identify suspected drug couriers. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, writing for the court, said there were sufficient factors to lead agents to reasonably suspect <PERSON> Sokolow </PERSON> was engaged in criminal activity. `` The fact that these factors may be set forth in a ` profile' does not somehow detract from their evidentiary significance as seen by a trained agent,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said In a dissenting opinion, Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said the ruling likely will lead to questioning and detaining innocent people. `` Reflexive reliance on a profile of drug courier characteristics runs a far greater risk than does ordinary, case-by-case police work of subjecting innocent individuals to unawarranted police harassment and detention,'' he said. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> was joined by Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> hailed the ruling, saying it `` validates an effective practice ... to crack down on drug trafficking.'' `` Without this tool, our anti-drug effort could be significantly hampered,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a statement. `` By upholding the ` profile' practice, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has struck a strong blow in support of law enforcement's war on drugs.'' <PERSON> Sokolow </PERSON> was stopped by <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents on July 25, 1984, as he returned to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> from a trip to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Authorities said he aroused their suspicions three days earlier when he and a female companion departed from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> airport for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. They said <PERSON> Sokolow </PERSON>, who appeared to be in his mid-20s, bought his plane tickets with $ 2,100 in cash taken from a roll of money that appeared to contain more than $ 4,000. He was wearing a black jumpsuit and a great deal of gold jewelry, appeared nervous, and he and the woman with him carried four handbags on the plane without checking any luggage. The agents also suspected he was using an alias because the name he gave the ticket agent was not the same as the name listed for the telephone number he gave the agent. Such behavior, dress and demeanor fit the profile of a drug courier, narcotics agents said. <PERSON> Sokolow </PERSON> pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and was sentenced to five years in prison. He appealed the conviction on grounds the cocaine should have been suppressed as evidence because authorities violated his constitutional rights against unlawful search and seizure when they stopped him in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> threw out the conviction, ruling that suspicion of a crime `` can not be intuited from a hodgepodge assembly of factors about individual character.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the accumulated factors weighed by the agents were enough to permit them to question <PERSON> Sokolow </PERSON> and detain him. They subsequently obtained a search warrant after a police dog indicated a handbag contained narcotics. `` Any one of these factors is not by itself proof of any illegal conduct and is quite consistent with innocent travel,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. `` But we think taken together they amount to reasonable suspicion.'' For example, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said, traveling from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> may not be suspicious. But, he said, `` Surely few residents of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> travel from that city for 20 hours to spend 48 hours in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> during the month of July.'' The use of drug courier profiles has survived previous high court scrutiny. Monday's ruling may give authorities a freer hand to use them. In other action, the court: _ Ruled in a case from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> that there is no `` generalized right of social association'' and allowed communities to protect young teen-agers by banning anyone over 18 from some dance halls _ Ruled, by a 6-3 vote in a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> case, that state courts lack the authority to approve adoptions of Indian babies by non-Indians even when the natural parents leave the reservation to give up the children Sending the case back to a tribal court for more study, the justices said tribal rights and Indian culture take precedence over individual rights in such circumstances. _ Agreed to decide whether a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> woman may be jailed for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her young son, who authorities fear may be dead

<HEAD>Teachers' Union Says $10 Billion More Needed For School Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's largest teachers union today called for $ 10 billion in new federal spending to counter `` a shocking erosion'' in education programs for the disadvantaged and handicapped. `` These programs reach only a fraction of the young people they were meant to serve,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said in issuing a report called `` Federal Education Funding: Present Realities and Future Needs.'' `` In state after state, the numbers in our new report clearly demonstrate a shocking erosion of federal support for these essential programs,'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Nothing could be more impractical for our nation than continuing this systematic underfunding.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> report contains the first estimates of what it would cost to serve all students currently eligible for help under four of the most important federal education programs. NEA has more than 1.9 million members across the country. Its report comes as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> prepares to tackle the fiscal 1990 budget. The report looks specifically at Chapter 1, grants to bolster basic skills among disadvantaged youngsters; the Education for All Handicapped Act, which helps states educate disabled youngsters; bilingual education, grants to make sure students with native languages other than English succeed in school; and <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> grants for college students from low-income families. The most serious erosion appears to have occurred in Chapter 1. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> report said the number of students served dropped from 7 million in 1980-81 to 5.7 million in 1988-89. At the same time the number of children in poverty swelled, so while the program reached 65 percent of eligible students in 1980-81, it reached only 40 percent by 1986. For fiscal 1989, the group said, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provided $ 4.6 billion for Chapter 1 _ enough to serve 47 percent of eligible students. To serve the estimated 8.5 million who will qualify next year, would cost about $ 6.9 billion _ a $ 2.3 billion increase over current levels. The authors of the 1974 handicapped act intended that the federal government would ultimately pay 40 percent of its cost to local school districts. But the federal share started at 12 percent and stayed there until 1980, and by fiscal 1989 had dropped to 7 percent, <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> said. To reach the 40 percent target would cost $ 8.4 billion, a $ 6.5 billion hike over current levels, the report said. And though funding has doubled since 1980, merely restoring the federal share to 12 percent would cost an extra $ 700 million. The bilingual education program currently serves one in 18 of students who need help in English language skills, <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> said. An increase of more than $ 1 billion would be needed to serve the 1.6 million students states report as eligible, the group said. While funds for <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> grants have increased slightly when adjusted for inflation, the increases have not come near matching the soaring costs of postsecondary education, <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> said. It also said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has `` fallen far short'' of meeting its own authorized funding level for the individual grants. Another $ 600 million would be needed to fully fund the maximum $ 2,900 Pell grants permitted in fiscal 1990, the teacher union said. Higher academic standards and a greater emphasis on analysis and problem-solving are `` doomed to failure unless schools and communities can maintain programs to help all students meet those standards,'' the report said. It says the solution, given state and local economic constraints, is to fully restore the federal share of support for public education. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> report was based on charts provided by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, an independent statistical analysis firm.

<HEAD>Bush Seeks $2.2 Billion in New 1989 Spending, $829 Million in Cuts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group that lobbies for poor people says President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to immediately slash $ 829 million in domestic spending would fall heavily on the needy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make the reductions to help pay for $ 2.2 billion in new 1989 spending he is seeking in other areas, including funds for veterans and for foster care. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an advocacy group for the needy, said that based on its analysis of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, $ 270 million in cuts would come from programs that provide education, job training, health and other assistance to the poor. `` The priorities reflected in these proposals raise questions about whether the talk of a kinder and gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> largely represents a rhetorical attempt at image-making,'' said the center's director, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, in a written statement. Under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan, more than 1,000 domestic programs _ excluding those he considers top priority _ would be slashed by nearly 1.1 percent across the board. The details of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request, made available by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, did not specify which programs would be affected by the proposed cuts. But the center, saying it based its figures on data from <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>, said $ 270 million of the proposed cuts would come from programs for the poor. The center said this would include $ 64 million in cuts in financial aid to needy students, $ 50 million for compensatory education for poor children, and $ 41 million for job training. Overall, the center said, the sharpest cuts would fall on the departments of education, $ 185 million; health and human services, $ 88 million; and agriculture, $ 80 million. The savings from the cuts <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is seeking would help finance increases the president wants in dozens of domestic programs for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. Even though most budget decisions are made before a fiscal year begins, presidents often seek additional spending in the middle of the year. Included in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for new spending is about $ 850 million to pay for cost-of-living increases for veterans and their survivors and for other Department of Veterans Affairs programs. The president is also seeking $ 400 million to repay states for their foster care efforts, $ 100 million to pay for increased refugees entering this country from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and $ 55 million for the government's uranium program. In addition, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to provide $ 892 million it has already committed itself to spending for the Guaranteed Student Loan program for college students. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent his request to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on March 24, when lawmakers were on their Easter recess. They return Tuesday. In his package, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the lawmakers he would later submit a request for about $ 50 million in aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, and $ 454 million to help bail out the nation's teetering savings and loan associations.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Congress Had First Quorum 200 Years Ago</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week celebrates a curious but important milestone: The 200th anniversary of the days on which the first House and first <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> achieved a quorum and were finally ready to begin the work of the new nation. The House marks the occasion today, April 4, three days after the actual April 1 anniversary. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> celebrates on Thursday, April 6, the actual date of its first working quorum. Commemorative postage stamps will be issued honoring the bicentennials of both houses. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> established under the Constitution first convened in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on March 4, 1789. But the absence of the required majority plus one prevented the two chambers from getting down to business. On that first day only 13 of the 59 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and only eight of the 22 senators were in attendance. Election complications, bad weather, muddy roads and just plain sloth get the blame as causes for the delay. The journal of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> noted with monotonous regularity that `` a quorum of the members not being present, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adjourned.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under the discarded Articles of Confederation had been noted for absenteeism and near paralysis, and many feared history was about to repeat itself. `` We lose credit, spirit, everything,'' Rep. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> wrote to a friend in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` The public will forget the government before it is born.'' The senators who had managed to reach <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> wrote to their absent colleagues: `` We apprehend that no arguments are necessary to evince to you the indispensable necessity of putting the government into immediate operation and, therefore ernestly request that you will be so obliging as to attend as soon as possible.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> had been elected the nation's first president, but could not enter office until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> achieved a quorum and met to count the ballots of the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. From Mount Vernon he grumbled that senators and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members were in a state of `` stupor or listlessness.'' But eventually the required numbers assembled. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, counting its first quorum on April 1 _ April Fool's Day some have noted _ elected <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhlenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> as its first speaker And <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>, much mollified now that work could begin, said he was pleased with his new colleagues. While there were few `` shining geniuses,'' he said, there were many who had `` experience, the virtues of the heart, and habits of business.'' On April 6 the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> counted its first quorum. The first order of business: Counting the votes of the electors and dispatching messengers to inform <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> that they had indeed been chosen president and vice president.

 The postage stamp honoring the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will display the gilt shield and eagle suspended over the presiding officer's chair in the Capitol's Old Senate Chamber, in use from 1810 to 1859. The stamp honoring the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> features the fanciful `` Car of History,'' a winged marble chariot which, since 1819, has borne the carved figure of Clio, the muse of history, over the floor of the Old House Chamber, now Statuary Hall. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who served 17 years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after his single term as president, was inspired in 1840 to dedicate a poem to the muse who is shown recording in a book the events unfolding on the floor of the legislative body below. Often at odds with his colleagues and irritated by their conduct, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> paid tribute to the muse for putting up with the `` wordy war'' conducted by the members. There was wit, there was wisdom, he acknowledged. But there was also `` the conflicting jar of ranting, raving parties, day and night ...'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> concluded: `` Oh! Muse historic _ in thy march sublime Still urging onward on the wheels of time. Canst thou not whisper to the chosen band But for one day to calm their senseless rage, And let thy volume bear one blessed page Of deeds devoted to their native land.''

<HEAD>Senate Thrift Plan Would Water Down Bush Bailout</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal for solving the savings and loan crisis waters down key sections of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reform plan but also hands industry lobbyists several defeats, according to a committee document. The proposal would make a number of changes sought by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L executives regarding deposit insurance, regulatory structure and capital requirements. However, other provisions, such as those restricting commercial real estate lending and strengthening the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, are less favorable to the industry than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Feb. 6 proposal. The document, obtained Monday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was prepared for closed-door meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel starting today. It outlines the recommendations of the staff of Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., the committee chairman The panel plans three private sessions this week in preparation for public bill-drafting sessions beginning April 13. Meanwhile, Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plan a private strategy session Wednesday, before the first open meeting on Thursday. Among the victories for the S & amp; L industry in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal are recommendations to: _ Equalize deposit insurance premiums for banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls by the year 2000 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal, after a series of changes, would charge S & amp; Ls 18 cents per $ 100 for their insurance versus 15 cents per $ 100 for commercial banks. _ Give the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> less control over <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators than proposed by the administration _ Allow some weak S & amp; Ls to grow modestly after the June 1991 deadline for meeting tougher capital standards <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would prohibit S & amp; Ls from expanding if their owners did not meet stricter requirements on how much money they must put up to back their institutions' loans. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal also would give <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls twice as long, 20 years versus 10 years, to meet tougher standards on a portion of capital known as goodwill. _ Prohibit the government from hurting regional real estate markets by selling repossessed property from failed S & amp; Ls too quickly It would add real estate expertise to the new government board overseeing S & amp; L bailouts by expanding the board from three government officials to five members, including two private business persons. As expected, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal would count <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rescue spending `` on-budget,'' as opposed to the complex administration plan for keeping $ 50 billion in <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L spending out of the budget deficit. Meanwhile, in a separate development, commercial banks sought guarantees that they would get refunds of deposit insurance premiums once the bank insurance fund regained its full strength of $ 1.25 in reserves for every $ 100 in deposits, up from a depleted 80 cents per $ 100 now. The administration has said rebates could begin by the mid-1990s, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bill allows regulators to decide whether or not to offer them and <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> wants that flexibility until the insurance fund reaches a level of $ 1.65 per $ 100. Banking groups, led by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, want to make rebates automatic after the fund reaches the $ 1.25 level. In at least three respects, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal would hand a defeat to S & amp; L lobbyists: _ Although the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would allow the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulatory agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, greater independence from the administration, it would transfer some of the bank system's most important powers, such as setting capital and accounting standards and supervising state-chartered S & amp; Ls, to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> _ Current law and the administration plan permits <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to invest as much as 40 percent of their assets in commercial real estate Under the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal, all but the <ORGANIZATION> healthiest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls would have stricter limits. _ Greater limits on activities would be permitted to state-chartered S & amp; Ls, but forbidden to <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls with federal charters Other significant changes offered by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> include: _ Removal of a section of the administration bill that could undo many of the S & amp; L rescues put together by regulators last year _ Fixed terms for the chairman and members of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> The administration wants the president to have the power to dismiss the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> chairman. _ Removal of tougher accounting standards for credit unions A dispute over the administration's proposal for that industry had threatened to delay the S & amp; L package.

<HEAD>Brady Looks for Quick Action on US Debt Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Will be topped around 9 a.m. EDT with final communique</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is challenging the world's democratic powers to move quickly and put in motion the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's plan for easing the Third World's politically explosive debt burden Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s proposals to ease the seven-year-old debt crisis were slated for a final review today from the executive committee of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Some participants at the spring meeting of the two organizations have expressed concerns that unless action is taken on the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan, political unrest could be unleashed in the fragile democracies of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where the huge debt burden has depressed living standards for most of this decade. At least 270 people were killed in riots in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> in February after the goverment imposed a new austerity program to satisfy creditors. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, in an address on Monday, told the organizations it was time `` to turn these concepts into specifics which provide a basis for lasting progress in dealing with the debt problem.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s scheme marks a sharp turn from past <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy because it seeks for the first time to reduce the $ 1.3 trillion Third World debt by getting commercial banks to voluntarily forgive part of their loans. Although <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies were not in total agreement with every element of the plan, Canadian Finance Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> predicted it would receive general approval. He told reporters that although much discussion had gone on about the technical problems of putting the plan in motion, `` there are no serious objections that have been put forward.'' The plan got a major boost on Monday when the Japanese stepped forward with a pledge to provide up to $ 4.5 billion in new loans to Third World debtors over the next several years. The funds, however, did not match the widely anticipated $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion expected from the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> also had been counting on other countries running large trade surpluses, such as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to recycle a part of their wealth into increased aid for developing nations. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> made clear there were some doubts about how completely the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan would be adopted, saying its proposal to use <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> resources to guarantee interest payments raised `` all sorts of problems.'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said the time had come for the commercial banks who had made the loans to do more to resolve the crisis by writing off debt without trying to shift the burden onto the backs of the international lending organizations. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> are supported by taxpayer funds from the 151-member countries, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest contributor. `` What I do not find acceptable is the idea that our taxpayers should bail out the commercial banks,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> told reporters at a briefing. The two large international lending agencies have a key role to play in the plan because they would be expected to put up about $ 12 billion each to guarantee to the banks that the remaining part of the debt or the annual interest payments would be repaid. The administration won general approval for its new approach from its six largest allies on Sunday, but the communique issued by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> promised only to `` examine'' the question of guaranteeing interest payments to the banks. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION>'s communique was more supportive of the less costly idea of guaranteeing the reduced level of debt. <PERSON> Mailson </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON>, finance minister of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the largest Third World debtor with $ 110 billion owed, praised the Brady initiative, calling it a `` major conceptual breakthrough'' with success depending on `` our capacity to move quickly and far enough.'' `` These new ideas raise new hopes,'' he said in his comments to the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> steering group. `` They should be translated into immediate action. It is crucial that such new hopes do not give place to new frustrations.''

The deduction was rejected four years later by a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franchise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> auditor, who assessed <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> additional taxes and interest. The Times said <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> appealed the auditor's decision to the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equalization </ORGANIZATION>, which has scheduled a hearing Thursday. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>, who lives in Rancho Mirage, argued in his tax appeal that he is entitled to a deduction on his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> income tax because he paid the $ 142,500. The kickback scandal came to light as the Watergate scandal was bringing down the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> resigned as President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s vice president Oct. 10, 1973, as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors. He pleaded no contest to charges of income tax evasion on thousands of dollars prosecutors said he had taken as <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> executive from 1962 to 1966 and as <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> governor from 1967 to 1969. The kickbacks were in exchange for government contracts, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> was ordered to pay $ 148,000 to the federal government and $ 14,105 to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> is seeking the tax deduction in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> because by the time the final ruling was issued in the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> case in 1981, he became a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> resident and had already made payment. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> also contended he was being taxed twice _ by <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> when he was directed to pay $ 14,105 in back taxes, and by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He also complained it is unfair to pay taxes on money he was not allowed to keep. `` There is no doubt it is patently unfair,'' <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, wrote in the tax appeal. But lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franchise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the question of double taxation is something <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> must resolve with <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. They said in <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>'s case, the tax was paid before he became a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> resident. `` The state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has never received any income in the form of taxes or otherwise, from the amounts -LRB- <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> -RRB- allegedly received as bribes during his various terms of office,'' <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobiles </PERSON>, a lawyer for the franchise board, wrote in replay to the appeal. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> -RRB- has made restitution of the alleged bribes only to the state of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and has paid taxes on the alleged bribes only to that state and to the federal government.''

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Stocks Hit New High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen today, while share prices finished at a new high on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 131.05 yen, down 1.21 yen from the previous day's 132.26-yen close. It opened at 131.63 yen and ranged between 130.88 yen and 131.88 yen. The dollar now has fallen 2.20 yen in the last four trading days. Traders said today's lower opening followed the dollar's overnight losses on overseas markets amid dollar-selling by European central banks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> `` Japanese investors already were reluctant to buy the dollar after the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s dollar-selling, yen-buying intervention yesterday -LRB- Monday -RRB-,'' said an analyst with a commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` That's why a rumor that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> made an inquiry to one of the American banks in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> spread in the market during morning trading and further discouraged participants' dollar buying,'' the analyst added. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s intervention Monday had a strong impact after the market's recent dollar-buying trend. The dollar had climbed to a closing of 133.25 on Wednesday. The Japanese central bank's dollar-selling intervention was its first since 1985. The communique released by the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> leading industrialized nations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monday, in which finance officials reaffirmed the desirability of stable currency rates, also contributed to pushing the dollar lower, the analyst said. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 203.39 points Monday, added another 270.18 points, or 0.82 percent, closing at 33,312.25, yet another high. The market's key index has climbed for the last six trading days, gaining almost 1,800 points. Dealers said stability in oil prices and the yen's upward trend in the foreign exchange market relieved investors and encouraged buying. Both individual and institutional investors were trading actively, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity Trading was active, with first section volume estimated at 1.7 billion shares, compared with 1.4 billion Monday.

<TEXT>
 Prosecutors today demanded the death penalty for a woman who said she was working for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> when she blew up a South Korean airliner in 1987, killing all 115 people on board. Calling the bombing `` an unpardonable crime to mankind,'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-hyung </PERSON> blamed `` the dictatorship in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for the grave crime of killing the passengers.'' The prosecution said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> ordered the bombing in an attempt to disrupt the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics, which were held without incident in September. The defendant, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Yui </PERSON>, 27, bowed her head and sobbed and told the court `` it is fortunate the truth has been disclosed. `` I now curse -LRB- North Korean President -RRB- <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> -LRB- his son and heir -RRB-,'' she said, wiping her eyes with a hankerchief. `` I do not know how to atone for my crime.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s defense attorney, <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong-il </PERSON>, said his client should not be punished even though she admitted to planting the bomb because she was `` forced to commit the act and it is someone else who needs to be punished _ <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' Sentencing was set for April 25. Court officials indicated privately that <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> may be pardoned because they say she was duped by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and has repented. `` Why do you keep her alive?'' screamed relatives of victims allowed into the courtroom. `` Kill her,'' they wailed. Security was tight and hundreds of police and security agents ringed the <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> during today's proceedings. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, defendants must stand trial even if they confess. The defendant said on South Korean television in January 1988 that she planted a bomb on the South Korean airliner in November 1987 as part of a North Korean plot to disrupt the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> last summer. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has denied involvement. Police Lt. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon-Ho </PERSON>, an explosives expert, testified today that the mixture of explosives used in the bomb was so powerful that it would have destroyed the aircraft in less than a second. `` There would be no time, no chance, to contact anybody,'' he told the court. The Korean Air Boeing 707 disappeared on a flight from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Andaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> as it approached the Burmese coast. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said she and another intelligence agent pretending to be Japanese tourists planted the bomb when they flew from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>, where they got off. The pair were arrested a short time later in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and attempted to take cyanide hidden in cigarettes. The other agent, an elderly man, died, but <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> recovered and was extradited to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Details of the bomb, how it was planted and detonated have come from <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> since little plane wreckage was ever found.

<TEXT>
 Two gunmen burst into the home of a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> man in the town of <LOCATION> Ballymoney </LOCATION> today and killed him in his bed, police said. No group immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell on <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police headquarters said in a statement that the attack occurred shortly after midnight in the town about 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Police said the unidentified 29-year-old victim was the father of four. They said his 3-month-old daughter was asleep in a crib beside his bed when he was shot. The child was unhurt, they said. A stolen car believed to have been used by the gunmen for their getaway was later found burned out in another part of <LOCATION> Ballymoney </LOCATION>. The killing appeared to be the latest in a series of what are thought to be retaliatory murders by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> extremists that began Feb. 12 with the slaying of a prominent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> attorney. Meanwhile, a news report on Monday said the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> transferred two of its Belfast-based journalists out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> threatened to kill them. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> refused to discuss the report by <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the domestic British news agency, other than to confirm `` two <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> personnel have received death threats from the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> did not name the journalists, but said one was the editor of news and current affairs for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the other was a female reporter. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the mainly <LOCATION> Roman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>KENAI FJORDS NATIONAL PARK, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales cavorting in the sparkling aquamarine waters of Two Arm Bay are the vanguard of migrating mammals that have arrived here every spring for thousands of years. Danger lurks just 30 miles to the north. Just beyond the town of <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Resurrection </LOCATION>, a sluggish river tinted iridescent by the sun flows across the surface of the sea. It appears to be drifting inexorably toward Two Arm Bay. It took just 12 days for tendrils of the 10.1 million gallon crude oil spill in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> to thread their way around reefs and rocks, through straits and narrows, to threaten the 669,501-acre national park. Just 12 days for man's folly to collide with nature's symmetry. `` I keep hoping the whales are so intelligent they'll sense the danger and just go away,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellina </PERSON>, the national park's superintendent. `` They've come back again right on time, and I do n't know how we'll protect them.'' The oil, released when the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran onto a reef on Good Friday, has been carried by winds and currents to within five miles of the park and the rich fishing grounds around <PERSON> Seward </PERSON>. `` Right now the spill is missing us, but we're planning for a worst-case scenario,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Castellina </PERSON>. `` From what I saw in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, that's the only way to go.'' Hundreds of miles of shoreline around the port town of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, terminus of the trans-Alaska pipeline, have been fouled by the spill, and thousands of animals and birds already have died because of the pollution. `` If we get hit there's not much to do to protect the park's 610 miles of shoreline, but we can boom off the salmon streams.'' Created in 1980, the new national park is a priceless necklace of bird rookeries, tidal pools, and watery whale playgrounds draped along the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>'s eastern coastline. Because most of the park can be reached only by floatplane or boat, it attracted fewer than 60,000 tourists last year, and is more hospitable to its critters than its visitors. The park chief, working with a federal-state disaster team and officials from <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION>, had to decide what should be saved first. With only several thousand feet of boom available to block the oil from contaminating rivers, streams, beaches and harbors, there were tough choices to make. `` It's that time of year when all the little critters come back to where they spend the summer,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Castellina </PERSON>. `` If the oil comes, the seals and birds are n't going to know what they're getting into and soon we'll have dead animals `` Then the bears who are waking up right now from hibernation are going to go down to the beaches and see all this great dead stuff and then this glop is going to get into their stomachs, and then will come the eagles, and this mess will be in the whole chain and could go on for years.'' Ms. <PERSON> Castellina </PERSON> said the group had decided the rich salmon-spawning Resurrection River would be saved first. But in places like <LOCATION> Beauty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Surprise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, Quicksand Cove and Granite Passage, the seals and otters and sea lions will be on their own because there's not enough help to go around. Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> received permission to deploy a boom itself instead of having to rely on the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Three boats carrying biologists are searching the park coastline to inventory flora and fauna. `` We want to be able to document what the impacts are because in the end <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> may get a bill,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, the park's resource management specialist. `` We're scrambling ... to collect pre-oil carcasses and pin down the cause of death so we can avoid the charge later of ` Well, how do you know those dead critters were n't there already?''' The grim tasks stand in stark contrast to promotional material the park offers. `` Humans have had little lasting impact on this environment,'' a colorful brochure says. `` The park's overwhelming significance is as a living laboratory of change.''

<HEAD>Marcos' Wife Plans to Embalm Him When He Dies, Paper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> plans to embalm her husband him when he dies and display his body in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> until she can scatter his ashes over the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to `` fertilize his country,'' a newspaper reported today. `` Not only will it be a political statement: It will be a spectacle _ an international spectacle to have <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> -LRB- lie is state -RRB- here,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> BusinessWorld </ORGANIZATION> in an interview at the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> home in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> over the weekend. President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> when he was ousted by a military-civilian uprising in February 1986 that swept <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, has been hospitalized in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since Jan. 15 for treatment of heart and lung ailments. Hospital officials say he remains in guarded condition. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has repeatedly rejected appeals by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' relatives to allow the former president to return. In February, <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> said that for security reasons the president and the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> had agreed not to allow even <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body to be brought home if he dies. `` I'll keep <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> here until 1992. Then I'll bring him home,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was reported as saying in the interview. That is the year when President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s six-year term ends and a new presidential election is held. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> mother's body was embalmed and put on display after she died last May at age 95. Relatives say they are waiting for the former president to return to bury her. The body of <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> now lies in state at <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' provincial home in <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION>, 240 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> A mortician visits every two months to inject embalming fluid and retouch her made-up face. In the interview, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> also said she was optimistic that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s successor would allow them to return and fulfill a wish of her husband to be cremated and have his ashes scattered `` to fertilize his country.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who is more than 20 years younger than her husband and was once groomed to succeed him, said she had no intention of running in 1992. `` I've seen it all. I've had it all. Now, all I want is to be left alone,'' she said. The Marcoses have been indicted on racketeering charges by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> grand jury. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent at her arraignment last October, but her husband's arraignment has been postponed because of his health. They are accused of stealing more than $ 100 million from the Philippine government and using the money to buy prime <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> property. The Aquino government says the Marcoses and their associates robbed the country of at least $ 10 billion in cash and other assets during the 20-year rule by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>.

 A white police officer has been charged with misdemeanor assault for allegedly slamming a black man's head through a store window in an arrest that was broadcast on national television. <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> also was charged Monday with filing a false police report in the Jan. 14 arrest of <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a self-styled activist against police brutality. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, trying to prove his theory that <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> police routinely mistreat minorities, drove into <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on a Saturday night with an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> crew following at a discreet distance. When <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was pulled over by police, the crew filmed the ensuing violence, which was broadcast on the `` Today'' show.

He and his partner, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, 26, were also charged with filing a false police report. The charges against <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison upon conviction.

<TEXT>
 Former Klansman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> received contributions from around the country in his successful race for a state House seat, campaign finance records show. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s report filed Monday showed he collected $ 137,000 and spent $ 116,000. Fellow Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>'s report showed he collected $ 198,900 and spent $ 189,000. Most races for the 105-member House cost candidates less than $ 30,000. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, 38, defeated <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> by 227 votes in the Feb. 18 special election to represent a nearly all-white district in <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> suburb. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> donated $ 16,500 to <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> and shunned <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a former grand wizard of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and founder of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of White People. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former president <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had endorsed <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, and national <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s victory. Nearly 2,700 people from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sent money to <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, ranging from $ 1 to $ 500. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> received money from fewer than 800 contributors. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, 63, called the totals in his report misleading, saying he actually wound up with a deficit rather than a surplus because $ 21,200 of his collections was money he loaned the campaign. Collections include contributions, loans and in-kind services according to state law. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> said his campaign repaid some of the loan but still has debts, `` including $ 13,000 to me,'' he said in a telephone interview. Meanwhile, state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nungesser </PERSON> announced a campaign to lure more Democrats to his party but said he has `` no plans to talk with Mr. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> abbout this party.'' `` Democrats elected <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> to office.

 Police and guerrillas battled again in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> today and officials said 180 people had been killed in four days of fighting since the territory began its transition to independence. South African military officials say the fighting is the worst in 23 years of <PERSON> bush </PERSON> war against the <ORGANIZATION> Sout-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> Police Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand said 161 guerrillas and 19 police had been killed since Saturday in a remote region near the Angolan border. He said 41 policemen and an undetermined number of guerrillas were wounded. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> said police, aided by Namibian soldiers, were conducting `` follow-up operations right through Ovamboland,'' the border strip where the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have major support. The independent South African <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said heavy fighting occurred Monday at <LOCATION> Oshikango </LOCATION>, a few miles from the border. South African officials said the fighting was started by guerrillas who crossed the border Saturday from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, violating a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accord that is to free <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from South African rule. Under the agreement, all guerrillas are to remain in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> at least 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s border until mid-May. Guerrilla officials and the Angolan government claim the fighters have been in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for some time and fired in self-defense after security forces attacked them. Villagers in northern towns, most of whom support the rebels, said they believe the guerrillas left <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to return home and did not expect a fight because the independence process officially has begun. The villagers said the guerrillas have no newspapers or radios at their Angolan bush camps, have little contact with senior guerrilla commanders and probably have little understanding of the peace process. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, however, accused the guerrillas of trying to organize armed bases inside <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said: `` I have very little doubt that the plan was that they should infiltrate to establish bases quickly, then they would have liked to claim that they have always been there.'' The government-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said in a radio editorial issued in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> today that the guerrilla incursions `` bear all the signs of a planned and well-organized operation.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials on Monday permitted 1,500 South African and Namibian troops to leave their bases to help policeman fighting the 1,200 guerrillas, South African Col. <PERSON> Japie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> and other officers said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said the fighting does not mean the peace plan is failing. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> investigation found that guerrillas had mounted a `` major incursion'' from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> during the weekend, said three Western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> to exercise restraint. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also said it was holding urgent consultations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to prevent the unraveling of the peace accord. `` All information available to us indicates that a major infiltration of northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> by military forces of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is occurring,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the guerrilla organization `` appears to be taking advantage'' of the vacuum created because <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers still are deploying to monitor the peace agreement. Only about 1,000 of the planned 4,650 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops have been deployed. `` We have 300 men in the northern part of the area. You can not say it is a failure,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> SWAPO </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> said Monday they remain committed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, which calls for Nov. 1 elections leading to independence early next year.

<HEAD>Pinochet's Finance Czar Resigns To Mull Presidency Bid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, the architect of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s successful free-market economy, says he has resigned as finance minister to consider running for president In response to <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>'s departure, President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> asked his 15 other Cabinet members Monday to resign so he could reorganize the body. Government spokesman <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Poduje </PERSON> said <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>'s replacement and any other Cabinet changes would be announced on Wednesday No important changes were foreseen in economic policy. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, 40, said he resigned to study the persistent appeals of a group of conservative politicians and business leaders who want him to run for president in the Dec. 14 elections. The group has plastered bumper stickers and posters supporting <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>'s candidacy throughout the capital and said last week it has collected 142,000 signatures from citizens backing the campaign. `` It never was, and is not, my intention to be presented for this type of candidacy,'' <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` Nonetheless, the situation has reached the -LRB- point -RRB- that my name is being publicly mentioned. `` I reached the conclusion that analyzing this situation was incompatible with keeping my post as finance minister,'' he said. The December elections are the first since before <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, toppling an elected leftist government. The 73-year-old army commander was obliged to call elections after losing a referendum in October on a proposal to extend his rule to 1997. Although his supporters want him to run, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> insists he will not be a candidate. The constitution bars him from running. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, who holds a master's degree in business adminstration from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, joined the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> government's economic team at age 29 and rose swiftly to become its chief. After serving as an advisor and as health undersecretary, he was named planning minister in 1983, banks superintendent a year later and finance minister in February 1985. Pushing exports and promoting foreign investment, the government's economic program has produced five consecutive years of growth while keeping inflation to a current annual rate of about 13 percent, far lower than most Latin American countries. It has elicited praise from financial experts, although <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s critics contend the policies carried a high social cost and reduced the buying power of most workers' wages. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> frequently boasts of his government's economic successes and often praises <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> in public. He has affectionately called him `` our <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Valiant </PERSON>,'' a reference to <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>'s ragged pageboy haircut. A recent opinion poll showed <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> as the strongest of several potential conservative or rightist presidential candidates, but lagging behind opposition leader <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, 70, is candidate of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and is seeking the backing of a coalition of 17 centrist and leftist parties.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigation of the fierce combat in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> found that nationalist guerrillas mounted a `` major incursion'' from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> the day the territory began its transition to independence, diplomats say. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> claimed the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> fighters had violated the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan under which it is ending its 74-year rule of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leaders denied guerrillas involved in the fighting near the Angolan border had crossed into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and criticized <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> adminstrators for agreeing to let South African troops reinforce police battling the guerrillas. `` Our people are being butchered under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> flag,'' said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Theo-Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON>, accusing South African forces of initiating the fighting. Namibian police say at least 161 rebels and 19 police have died in the fighting that began Saturday, when a formal cease-fire was to have begun. They said the fighting continued today. Under the U.N.-brokered independence accord, all guerrillas are to remain in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> at least 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s border until mid-May. But diplomats said the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas apparently felt they were entitled under the accord to set up bases inside <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision just as the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, whom they have been fighting for 23 years. Whether <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> should be allowed in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> has been a contentious question in the independence process. The report on the situation by investigators led by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative for <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, was relayed to Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, who briefed <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members on Monday, said three Western diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity. The diplomats said the report, presented in an atmosphere of unusual secrecy, concluded that up to 1,000 guerrillas infiltrated northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> but that their motive was unclear. Its details were not disclosed. Black African diplomats were outraged. `` There can never be any question of infiltration, these are Namibians,'' said Zambian Ambassador <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuze </PERSON>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has accused the rebels of infiltrating in an attempt to set up bases, an option that was rejected during 10 years of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiations on terms of the Namibian independence plan. Some <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats said they believed many rebels misunderstood the terms of the cease-fire and peace plan and thought they could safely march home to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> bearing their weapons. Others accepted <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s claim that the rebel leadership sent the guerrillas in to establish base camps in a bid to have them put under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision just as South African troops are to be confined to barracks. Diplomats said <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>'s report did not attempt to assign motives for the border crossing. <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON> insisted the guerrillas always had been in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and criticized <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> administrators in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for allowing South African troops to reinforce the territorial police. `` The president of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> -RRB-, on March 29, issued a directive to <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> combatants in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to make contact with -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers -RRB- for purposes of being confined to base,'' he said. Since armed rebels troops are obviously in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON>, `` It would make sense, and it would serve everybody's interest if they would be confined to base and monitored by -LRB- U.N observers -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON> criticized <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials who allowed the deployment of 1,500 South African troops to back up Namibian police, but did not name names. `` It's a very ugly, ugly sin. I think you all know that there has been a longstanding bloody conflict between South African forces and our forces, and for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> to pretend that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is an impartial, disinterested party in this conflict is, to say the lest, most preposterous,'' said <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said the fighting did not mean the peace plan is failing, adding that most of the 4,650 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops planned for the mission are not yet on the scene. Only about 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops have been deployed. `` We have 300 men in the northern part of the area. You can not say it is a failure,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> SWAPO </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> said Monday that they remain committed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, which calls for Nov. 1 elections leading to independence early next year. Besides independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, the plan calls for the withdrawal of Cuban troops who have been helping the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> fight South Africa-backed rebels.

 Contra rebels have agreed to observe a cease-fire until February, when elections are scheduled in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but pledge to keep their forces combat-ready to pressure the Sandinista government. A source in the rebel directorate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> told the rebels about the decision during visits Friday to Contra camps just across the border from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> is the Contras chief military leader. Radio Liberacion, the Contras' radio station, also broadcast a message Monday from <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> that said: `` The rebels will not launch any attack against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> until February 1990. We will not look for combat but will permanently be on the defensive. `` The rebel army will be preserved intact, on the defense and watching for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to fulfill their promise of greater democracy for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government has declared monthly unilateral cease-fires since the expiration of a temporary truce the two sides signed in March 1988. The truce was to lay the groundwork for a permanent peace but talks collapsed last September. There was no immediate Sandinista reaction to the rebel announcement. In February, five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents agreed to come up with a plan by mid-May to disband the Contras. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in turn, agreed to general elections in February and to other steps toward democratic reforms. That accord took <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials by surprise. They reacted with a bipartisan proposal now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to provide about $ 45 million in non-lethal aid to the rebels through February. Fighting in the 7-year-old war has diminished to sporadic skirmishes since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras ended in February 1988. An estimated 11,000 rebels and members of their families live in the Honduran camps. The message broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberacion </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> as saying: `` The weapons of the freedom fighters constitute the only guarantee that the Nicaraguan people have to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> into fulfilling their promise of introducing democracy to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` For that reason, our troops will remain intact and alert but will not participate in actions of destruction or attacks against <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> military positions. `` We reaffirm our desire to achieve democracy and freedom for our country through peaceful means, but we reaffirm also our decision to achieve these desires through weapons if the peaceful means fail.'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> reportedly left for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Friday. The rebel source also said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, known as Commander Quiche, had temporarily stepped down as head of the Contras' chiefs of staff because of pain from an old combat wound. The source said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Galeano </LOCATION>, known as Commander <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, replaced <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>.

 With no telephone nearby and the fire department three miles away, a man watched helplessly as flames engulfed his mobile home and took the lives of six children, five of them his grandchildren. `` I woke up when the fire bug -LRB- alarm -RRB- went off and tried to get all the children out,'' English, 57, said Monday. Five other grandchildren who had been sleeping managed to escape with English after the fire broke out early Sunday. One of them suffered a burned hand, family members said. `` I heard the fire alarm and my cousins let the window up and pushed the screen out and all four of us got out the window,'' said <PERSON> Jacobia </PERSON> English, 11, who lost two brothers. Next-door neighbor <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he `` heard the hollering'' from the double-wide trailer and `` knew the kids were burning up.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> drove three miles to <PERSON> Rembert </PERSON>, a small town of about 500, and set off a siren, but the fire had nearly consumed the home by the time he returned with firefighters. Family members had gathered in this <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> town to celebrate the birthday of English's daughter, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>. Her three children _ 8-month-old <PERSON> Nericaletha </PERSON>, 1-year-old <PERSON> Kesim </PERSON> and 3-year-old Clyde _ died in the blaze. County Coroner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> identified the other victims as the <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> children's cousins, <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON> of <PERSON> Rembert </PERSON>, ages 9 and 11, and a friend, <PERSON> Terrance </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, 5, of <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>. Officials said the children died of smoke inhalation. <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jacobia </PERSON>'s mother, had been with other family members in a mobile home 150 yards down a dirt road from the trailer when the fire broke out. The family gathered at the home again Monday to mourn. `` I just ca n't get over it.

 An immigration judge has ordered the deportation of a reputed organized crime boss linked to a dozen killings and known as the `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> received the order Monday, but it could take moths before his is deported to his native <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, assistant counsel for the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> said Judge <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zerbe </PERSON> weighed the positive factors in <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s case _ his wife and one of his children are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens _ against negative factors that included <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s alleged membership in an Italian criminal clan similar to the Mafia and his entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a false passport The negative factors `` weigh overwhelmingly against an exercise of judgment on -LRB- <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s -RRB- behalf,'' the judge decided. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Parenti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s attorney, said he planned to challenge the ruling before the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're appealing the fact that they ca n't use foreign convictions to deport somebody,'' <PERSON> Parenti </PERSON> said. `` Basically they're trying to accomplish through the back door what they could n't do through extradition.'' Authorities originally tried to deport <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> on an Italian extradition memo, but the Italian charges were dropped after <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> was not brought to trial within 18 months of his arrest as required by law in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Italian authorities charged that <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> ordered or committed 12 killings in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> from April 1982 through June 1983 while holding a top post in the <ORGANIZATION> Nuova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camorra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizzata </ORGANIZATION>, a criminal clan that operates in and around <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, near <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s home town of <LOCATION> Acerra </LOCATION>. When those charges were dropped, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities shifted the case to immigration courts, moving to deport <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> on grounds that he entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, 31, was arrested in March 1988 at his North Side restaurant. He also had worked as an auto-body repairman, car salesman and sausage-maker.

<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> faculty has rejected a proposal to make racism courses mandatory following several racist incidents on campus in recent years. Faculty instead agreed Monday to ask the curriculum committee of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literature </ORGANIZATION>, Science and the Arts to consider by next fall ways to offer racism studies. Incidents at the university have included the distribution of a flyer declaring `` open season'' on blacks in 1987, racist jokes by a disc jockey on the student radio station and the stuffing of <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> literature under black students' doors. Faculty defeated by 140-120 a proposal that would have required students to take four credit hours of classes dealing with racism. Classes could have been in economics, sociology or other fields. Philosophy Prof. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Railton </PERSON>, who drew up the proposal, said he was optimistic despite the vote. `` The debate was a substantive and good one. I think the discussion and the vote will have impact on thinking of the -LRB- curriculum -RRB- committee,'' <PERSON> Railton </PERSON> said. About 5,000 of the university's 32,400 students are minorities, some of whom say the campus has been plagued with racist and anti-Semitic graffiti and occasional tauntings.

 Syrian and Christian gunners attacked residential areas in and around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with howitzers and rockets, and police said at least six people were killed and 18 wounded during a night of fighting. The bombardment that began late Saturday subsided into sporadic exchanges at daybreak today. The overnight casualties raised the toll to 153 people killed and 499 wounded since March 8, when the latest round of hostilities broke out between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian troops and an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s electricity authority said in a statement that its power station in the Christian suburb of <PERSON> Zouk </PERSON> would run out of fuel oil today and it would stop providing power to most of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The statement said a freighter loaded with 30 tons of fuel oil has not been able to unload its cargo at the power station's dock because of the shelling. Insurance companies `` want a solid cease-fire before accepting to cover any ship that wants to dock at the Zouk station,'' the statement said. The independent daily An-Nahar and other publications today carried front-page statements from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> calling for a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Despite the relative lull today, civilians remained huddled in basements and bomb shelters. A dozen families in the basement of an apartment building in the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> district of <LOCATION> Adonis </LOCATION> dispatched one man to a bakery for bread. `` This is the safest way, we will send one of us to buy food for the whole building every day until a cease-fire is declared and accepted by both sides,'' <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Shedyak </PERSON> said. `` Yes, there is a lull, but there is no cease-fire. We will not take any unnecessary risks,'' Shedyak, a mechanical engineer, said in a telephone interview. Kuwaiti Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> was due in the Syrian capital of <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> today to try end the present confrontation. <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> heads a six-man <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee assigned to find a settlement to a political crisis that threatens to cement <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s partition into sectarian mini-states The leftist daily paper As-Safir, which is close to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> would propose a two-month truce in the conflict to give the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee enough time to solve the crisis. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, backed by 20,000 troops, has insisted that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> be party to any cease-fire accord. The current fighting broke out when <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal militia ports that diverted $ 100 million from government-run ports. The Syrians have 40,000 troops in predominantly Moslem areas of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a peacekeeping mandate their received from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, two years after civil war broke out in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Officially, the Syrians maintain that their troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are not involved in the confrontation with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces, which are entrenched across a 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, the Shiite Moslem chief of the Amal militia, said Monday in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> that 20 representatives of Moslem and leftist groups would meet <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Press reports said the group would outline its desire for a new political system that distributes powers equally among the various Lebanese sects, the election of a new president and formal links with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The Christians are to dispatch a 10-man delegation for a meeting with <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> later in the week. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been without a head of state since Sept. 22, when the six-year-term of President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> expired with parliament failing to elect a successor. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a fellow Maronite, head of an interim military cabinet to rule pending the election of a new president. Syrian-backed Moslems rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment because it violated a 45-year-old tradition of having a Sunni Moslem prime minister.

 A South Korean dissident today called his unauthorized visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> a success and said he was ready to face arrest at home. `` I'm not nervous about my arrest but I hope I wo n't be arrested,'' Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON> told a news conference. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government has said it will jail <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> for his trip to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. South Koreans are prohibited from visiting the north without government approval. Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has warned that <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s arrest would hamper dialogue between the sides. In South Korean, authorities imprisoned two dissident leaders Monday in an apparent crackdown on dissent connected to the Moon visit. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> said his wife told him by telephone Monday night that his three sons also had been arrested. Reports from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said the sons were under investigation. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, 71, has been arrested several times for anti-government activities since the 1970s. Asked why his sons had reportedly been detained, he smiled and said `` they have the wrong father.'' <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> arrived in the Chinese capital Monday after a nine-day visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He said he planned to leave Wednesday for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, but that he had not decided when he would return to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to deny <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> a visa. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> had been granted a transit visa that would allow him to spend nine days in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not say whether <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had requested that <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> be denied a visa. They said that <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s request was treated the same as any South Korean civilian's. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, Justice Minister <PERSON> Huh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyong-koo </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> would be arrested when he returns for violation of national security law. South Korean officials say the trip aided the north in its attempts to cause unrest and discredited the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> met for seven hours with North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> for talks on reunifying the peninsula. `` I think the success of the visit was greater than I expected, and I am very happy,'' <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> said he was pleased by South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-Woo </PERSON>'s statement on July 7 calling for talks with the north and `` thought it was natural to go to the north and have a meeting. He blamed the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government for failing to come up with a concrete plan for reunification and said his visit to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> `` was a great surprise to them -LRB- the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government -RRB- so it's natural for them to react very strongly I think they will come to their senses.'' <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, an adviser to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s main dissident group, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, was invited to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by the governmental Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland. He was reunited with 18 members of his family living in the North. North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been bitter rivals since the division of the peninsula in 1945, despite recent talks aimed at eventual reunification.

The paper started a Sunday edition last month. `` The financial losses have been stemmed and the paper should be profitable by the end of 1989,'' Price said in a statement. `` Daily circulation has increased by over 100,000 since the paper was acquired'' and advertising linage is up. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> said Price `` played a key role in taking a nearly defunct afternoon newspaper with a circulation that had dropped as low as 2 million a week and bringing it back to a strong newspaper with a Sunday edition and a weekly circulation of over 4 million.''

 After talks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, a cheerful President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> seemed pleased but was non-committal about their discussions on issues that often have left them deeply divided. `` Family-like,'' was how <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> described the talks after bidding <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> good night Monday on the steps of the presidential palace. When reporters pressed him for details, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> had ready a two-word linguistic hybrid: `` glasnost manana.'' That was <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s way of saying more on the discussions will be known when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> addresses the National Assembly late this afternoon, the last major scheduled event during his 63-hour stay in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said improving the international climate is central to his discussions with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. `` It is generally felt that there is mounting aspiration in the world for better relations, and I think that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> understand their responsibility,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. The report made no mention of differences between the two leaders. Moments before <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said good night Monday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> descended the steps of the ornate pre-revolutionary palace with his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, at his side. They received applause from the diplomats and officials who had joined them for a glittering reception. Aside from visits to two monuments and an exhibit highlighting the achievements of the revolution, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spent Monday with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in talks. Speculation swirled all day about a possible <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announcement forgiving <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> its debt to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, estimated at between $ 8 billion and $ 20 billion, but <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said that issue never came up. Debt, he said, is not a problem for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> but for other Latin American countries. His answer did not appear to rule out a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announcement that he will give <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> a break on debt repayments. Combined with the estimated $ 6 billion <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> owes Western countries, the island is one of the most heavily indebted countries in the world in per capital terms. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the Soviets already appear to have reduced the subsidies they pay by buying <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> sugar at higher-than-world-market prices. And some said they expected <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to tell <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> bluntly _ but in private _ that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> must put its economic house in order. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> vice foreign minister, said today that a difference in views on economic policy `` does n't necessarily mean that you should have a confrontation or difference of other sort.'' In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON> also characterized Monday's talks as `` warm and friendly.'' <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s spokesman, said the morning portion of the talks stressed Latin American debt and drug trafficking. A Soviet official said Monday evening that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might have an announcement this afternoon relating to a Latin American issue, but refused to be more specific. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in December the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was prepared to offer the least-developed countries a moratorium on debt service and `` in quite a few cases to write off the debt altogether.'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has campaigned for years for cancellation of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s $ 420 billion foreign debt, declaring it is unpayable and has contributed to economic decline throughout the hemisphere. The Cuban revolutionary leader seemed ebullient after Monday's marathon talks, leaving no hint that any of the widely publicized ideological problems with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were impairing their relationship A Soviet official, insisting on anonymity, said Western reports had been making too much of Soviet-Cuban differences. He said the Soviet goal is to de-emphasize ideology. But <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> himself has been a stalwart supporter of maintaining communist orthodoxy, criticizing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for straying far afield with his campaign for greater openness and a restructuring of the Soviet economy. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> explained to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> the details of last week's nationwide parliamentary elections, one of the most dramatic symbols of the Soviet leader's reform program because they were the country's first contested elections in seven decades. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was to speak to the assembly today after visits to local health and construction projects and a final meeting with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in early afternoon. He is to leave for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Wednesday morning.

 A French tour ship with 42 aboard people caught fire on the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> today, badly damaging the vessel and injuring six passengers, officials said. Police and fire boats rescued all 34 passengers and eight crew members from the burning <ORGANIZATION> Alsace </ORGANIZATION> 1, said <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeck </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. `` Two people were hospitalized because of shock and four because of smoke inhalation,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeck </PERSON> said by telephone from his office in <LOCATION> Wesel </LOCATION>, about 25 east of the Dutch border. The <ORGANIZATION> Alsace </ORGANIZATION> 1 was near <LOCATION> Wesel </LOCATION> when the fire broke out. Two fire boats fought the blaze, but police said the ship sustained major damage. `` I do n't know the exact amount of damage on board the boat, but it was considerable,'' said <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeck </PERSON>.

 For the couple standing vigil beside a collapsed highway bridge, the waiting was harder than knowing if their loved one was killed along with seven others when the 55-year-old span gave way. `` They brought up a piece of car that was the same color as his,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said Monday as searchers continued looking for victims in the rain-swollen <LOCATION> Hatchie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Seven bodies have been pulled from river since the bridge collapsed Saturday night. But authorities continued their search today, operating under the belief at least one more car is still submerged. <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said his half-brother, <PERSON> Adrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 26, has not been seen since shortly before a 90-foot section of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 51 bridge fell, sending cars and a tractor trailer rig plunging 25 feet into the water. `` He left the hospital and I went to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> the same time,'' said <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, who with his wife, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON>, has been waiting beside the river since they first heard of the bridge collapse a few hours after the accident. `` He did n't make it. He was going back to <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> because his daddy was sick and he was going to stay with him.'' Authorities said they, too, are working on the assumption that <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' car is somewhere in the dark, swirling water. Monday, a dog trained to sniff bodies appeared to find something. Authorities resumed dragging operations this morning. Divers were forced to wait because of strong currents in the river, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. Also Monday, workers began cutting up the three 28-foot bridge spans. When the 100-ton concrete slabs are jackhammered into manageable pieces, a crane will be brought in to remove them, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thacker </PERSON>, regional manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON>, a diver with the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, said searchers were unsure what they will find under the slabs, two of which are known to be lying on at least three cars and a tractor trailer truck. `` Anything's possible,'' he said. Also, <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> said, it is unclear if any vehicles went into the river but were not trapped by the falling slabs. `` I do n't know. With this current, if a car went off after it fell, it could be a mile down the river,'' he said. The cause of the collapse was unknown, but state <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said heavy spring floods following two years of drought may have undercut a bridge support. Two inspections during the last 18 months revealed no problems, he said. The collapse apparently began when a support holding up one of the bridge sections gave way, said <PERSON> Jacky </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a state inspector. As the cars and the 18-wheeler plunged of the bridge, the other two highway sections came crashing down on them, he said. Residents say they have worried about the safety of the bridge for some time, but <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Executive <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said his office has not received any such complaints. `` I've crossed that bridge many times every week and I've never had any fear of it,'' he said. `` Obviously, they're going to complain now.'' The bridge, eight-tenths of a mile long, carries two northbound lanes of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 51 across the Hatchie about five miles north of <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION>. A companion bridge, built in the mid-1970s to carry the southbound lanes, was unaffected but has been closed indefinitely while state and federal officials investigate. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterman </PERSON>, an investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said it would take his agency several months to file a report.

 A retired <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> executive testified today that he hired a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist on the recommendation of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, former vice president for marketing, testified that <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer who has pleaded guilty in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal, recommended that he hire <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaides </PERSON> as a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist for the California-based aerospace company. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said he was told by <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Savaides </PERSON> was `` employed by a company engaged in manufacturing and selling similar equipment.'' `` You felt he knew his way around the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>?'' asked prosecutor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanly </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said yes. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, who is expected to testify later, is cooperating with the government investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal, which involved the payment of bribes and kickbacks to military procurement officials and outside <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> consultants to obtain procurement information and influence the award of lucrative contracts. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, testifying under an immunity grant at the bribery and conspiracy trial of three <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> executives in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, also told how he was angered when told that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> defense consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> was working, without his knowledge, to help <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> obtain a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract. `` You might say I became angry,'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> testified, recalling that he went to see <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, one of the defendants, and `` expressed my outrage over meddling in my department.'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said he learned that <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> was working for <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> from <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, another defense consultant who, like <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify as a prosecution witness in the case. Recalling the events of the fall of 1985, <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> initially told him he was `` not prepared to discuss it. The only thing he said was he did not engage a consultant.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and two other <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> executives are defendants in the first trial of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` Ill Wind'' investigation into <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement fraud. Prosecutors are trying to prove that the three conspired to bribe a public official for information that helped their company win a $ 24 million contract. The three defendants _ <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON> _ were executives with <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. Lawyers for the men, who are charged with bribery, conspiracy and making false statements, say their clients have done nothing wrong. `` This is a case about bribing, about cheating, about lying,'' charged Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHenzel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in his opening arguments Monday. The three are accused of conspiring to bribe a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official to influence the award of a hand-held radar testing device for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> testified, he met <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> at a meeting in <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s office that was also attended by <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON>. The meeting was held to discuss hiring <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> to help <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> get the contract, <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> officials `` he knew his way around the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, that he could do a job for us.'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> wanted a written agreement which he described as ink on paper to formalize his consulting relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>. In return `` he would take measures to assure the contract would be awarded to <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>.'' The agreement called for <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> to receive $ 10,000 in advance for expenses and $ 150,000 as a reward once <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> obtained the contract. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said he later expressed misgivings to <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> about the agreement with <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>. Recalling a conversation on a golf course, <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, `` I think we were being foolish. I thought we were being ripped off.'' Asked how <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> replied, <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said, `` He said I was just as involved as everybody else.'' At Monday's opening day of the trial the first witness was <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contracting officer. On the witness stand, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> discussed the 25-month process that led to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in July 1987 to sign with <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> a contract to make hand-held radar test equipment. <PERSON> DeHenzel </PERSON> argued the three defendants were part of a conspiracy that included bribing <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to receive inside information crucial to winning the contract. He said <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> provided information about another competitor that should have been kept secret. `` A lot of information should not have been given to anyone outside government,'' he said. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> also spoke during internal <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> discussions in favor of a position that benefited <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Specifically, the former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official opposed limiting the contract to small businesses, a decision that would have excluded <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> from bidding. That decision was ultimately reversed. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> were all named in the indictment returned by a grand jury in January. They pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the government. <PERSON> Savaides </PERSON> also pleaded guilty, but he was not indicted. The defendants' lawyers said their clients never knew about a secret deal that <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> made with his associates. Kaub, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON> believed <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> used legitimate methods to obtain information about contracts, a time-honored practice, they said. `` The conspiracy in this case was directed as much as concealing from <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> as defrauding the government,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s lawyer. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuohey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON>'s attorney, described the deal between <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and his associates as a `` conspiracy of silence.'' <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>' executive vice president dealing with government contracts. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and his successor, <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON>, were also executive vice presidents. As part of the evidence, prosecutors have said they will play tapes from conversations between <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and his associates. The government taped the telephone calls as part of their investigation. The coast-to-coast investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 150-billion-a-year purchasing system began nearly three years, but it was not publicly revealed until June 1988

The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Brackenridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> started his banking industry career in the 1930s as an office boy at a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bank. He eventually became president of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 65 miles south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.

 Heavy rains battered <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> today after spawning tornadoes that ripped roofs from buildings and homes. A toddler swept from his mother's arms was presumed drowned in floodwaters and an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> woman apparently was electrocuted. Much of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> was under a tornado watch early today; the mayor in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, declared a state of emergency after the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> overflowed its banks; and ski resorts in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> reveled after an 18-inch snowfall. Severe thunderstorms blew through western <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> on Monday, demolishing part of an aluminum processing processing plant in Mt. Pleasant. Tornadoes followed the storm and destroyed homes and uprooted buildings, authorities said. No injuries were reported, said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, a Mount Pleasant police dispatcher. The storms were accompanied by hail, rain and spectacular lightening. Many areas reported downed trees, signs, roof damage and electrical failures. At least two tornadoes touched down in southeastern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, ripping roofs off farm buildings and blowing over a mobile home, authorities said. A tornado was sighted just south of <LOCATION> Poplar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bluff </LOCATION>, but no injuries were reported, said <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Butler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's dispatcher. Tornadoes were spotted throughout <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> late Monday, but there were no reports of injuries or serious damage. However, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> placed most of the state _ 65 of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>' 75 counties _ under a tornado watch that ended early today. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, officials resumed their search today for a 16-month-old boy swept from his mother's arms as she tried to get him to safety. The 35-year-old mother told police she had just picked up her children from a babysitter and was going home when her car stalled on a gravel road in southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. By the time the floodwaters reached the window, she was able to get her 4 - and 5-year-old child out of the car, said Capt <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Gibson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The woman thought she had the toddler in her arms, but he was swept away, <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. An <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION> woman either drowned or was electrocuted in 5 inches of water on the city's northside, police said. An autopsy was scheduled today on <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 27, who was found by police at 2:15 a.m.. A utility pole was near her body and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers measured 180 volts in a fence nearby A tornado Monday at <LOCATION> Grayville </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> toppled trees and utility poles, overturned cars and trucks and tore metal roofs off of barns. Baseball-sized hail clunked down on the community of 2,000 people. In <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> said he was surprised by the speed with which runoff from melting snow and rain sent the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> over its banks. `` It did really catch everyone by surprise ... a new twist of events,'' he said. `` Of course, we know that's true during the thaw. If the temperature goes outside a standard deviation range and you get a little rain on top of it, it just changes instantly.'' <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> declared a state of emergency, clearing the way for construction of temporary dikes and the leasing of pumps to fend off flood waters. Up river, hundreds of volunteers filled sandbags to shore up dikes in <LOCATION> Breckenridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and neighboring <LOCATION> Wahpeton </LOCATION>, where flooding caused by ice jams, runoff and rain threatened low-lying areas. Ski resort operators in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> were happy following a six-day storm that left up to 5 feet of snow in the mountains. The storm did cause intermittent road problems and left the avalanche danger high. The storm brought 18 inches to some areas on Monday, temporarily closing <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>. `` For this time of year, to have this kind of a sustained snow, is very rare,'' said <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, forecaster with the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avalanche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` The storms usually hit and get out within 24 or 48 hours.

Both <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said senators told the Egyptian president that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must keep the large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit in mind in dealing with all requests for economic and military assistance. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said senators appeared favorably impressed with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s description of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s economic reform program, including the reduction of subsidies on a number of consumer products and revisions in the country's tax structure. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was asked if senators were satisfied at the pace of the <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> program. `` Obviously every national leader confronts the same general problem of the pace of economic reform,'' he replied. `` We confront a similar problem in dealing with our budget deficit.'' `` The president argued that the pace he is pursuing is the one most appropriate to their circumstances and the one most likely to bring success,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. On another subject, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> flatly denied reports that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> intends to acquire chemical weapons and said he was `` quite angry about being lumped in'' with such nations as <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which is widely believed to be ready to produce such weapons. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> met on Monday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who said he has set as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goals in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> an end to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and fulfillment of political rights for the 1.2 million Palestinian Arabs who live in the territories. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reaffirmed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security and said all the goals were shared by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The statement appears to put pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in advance of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s talks here Wednesday and Thursday. But <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, answering questions from the floor at a dinner Monday night, said he was not asking the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Exerting pressure wo n't solve anything,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, in the second day of his visit, also met today Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. The Egyptian leader is hoping <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will approve new weapons sales once they are formally proposed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and that $ 230 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid will be released. The aid was withheld in March pending reforms in the way <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> manages its economy which that country must have in place by June. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not spell out the political rights he seeks for the Palestinians who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Nor did he amplify his call for an end to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the territories lost by the Arabs in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> War of 1967. The president put his position this way: `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> share the goals of security for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the end of the occupation, and achievement of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> political rights.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went on to say that a `` properly structured international conference could play a useful role at an appropriate time'' in reaching those goals through negotiations. In <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s chief adviser welcomed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement as an `` important and serious development.'' <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> feels `` this will give a real push for peace efforts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' But in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> indicated that during his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit he will state his opposition to an end to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s endorsement of an international peace conference. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has been pushing for a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> conference for years. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the Egyptian leader had the end of the year or early 1990 in mind. `` We believe there is a lot of ground that has to be covered before there could be a conference,'' the official told reporters at the White House. He answered their questions under rules that shielded his identity. All <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrations since 1967 have said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should yield land on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> in exchange for peace. But none has specified whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would urge its ally to yield all the territory. The resolutions approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in 1967 and in 1973 after the Yom Kippur war were intentionally vague on this point. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not specify whether his administration was demanding total <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who also demanded anonymity, said `` there was nothing new'' in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement and `` I did n't see anything new.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who arrives Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, will propose holding elections among the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in the territories to find leaders who would negotiate their future with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that elections held under Israeli supervision were unacceptable to the Palestinians, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who briefed reporters said. Evidently <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not reject the idea out of hand. The official said the president had raised questions about various forms of supervision. A revolt by <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> that began in December 1987 has led to the death of 419 Arabs and 18 Israelis. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> holds the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> partly responsible for the uprising. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> he doubted <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> could control the violence, the official said.

<HEAD>$100 a Week for Not Planting Grapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATER MILL, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The owner of a winery has been ordered to pay $ 100 a week in fines because he did not plant enough grape vines on his property. The town of <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> says <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reve </ORGANIZATION> winery, was required to plant vines by April 1 on all 55 acres he owns in Water Mill and <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION>. He now has vines planted on 33 acres. Town attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the town wants to keep <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> from erecting a large wine factory on the land, which is in the middle of a residential area. The money to pay the fine will be taken from a $ 5,000 bond <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> posted in 1986 when the town planning board approved his plan to build the winery, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said he wanted to plant all 55 acres but an upstate nursery refused to deliver vines without being paid $ 30,000 in advance. Other nurseries were short on grapevines and it might be another year before he can plant more vines on his land, he said.

 A former colleague of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified today that responses <PERSON> North </PERSON> was preparing for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members on Contra assistance did not appear to be accurate. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> recounted for the jury in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial a conversation in September 1985 in which <PERSON> North </PERSON> shared some of the responses he was preparing for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members asking about reports he was assisting the Nicaraguan rebels `` He showed you some of his answers?'' asked prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. `` I asked him if they were accurate and they did not appear to be so,'' responded <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON>, who at the time worked with <PERSON> North </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securiy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Recalling <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON>'s previously secret testimony before a federal grand jury, <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked, `` Did you do anything?'' in the conversation with <PERSON> North </PERSON> after seeing the responses. When <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> balked at answering <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, the prosecutor put his hand up to his nose and then stretched out his arm in a gesture reminiscent of the tale of Pinocchio, a puppet whose nose grew longer when he lied. `` Not that long,'' responded <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON>, as the courtroom erupted in laughter. North is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 by allegedly preparing letters signed by then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> denying the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff was assisting the Contras. The denials came amid a two-year congressional ban on military aid to the rebel force. <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> recalled a comment by a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official, `` that whatever <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> was doing he was bound to get us all in a lot of trouble and he wanted to stay far away from him.'' `` Was Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> considered a trustworthy person'' by his colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>?, asked <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. `` I had considered Colonel North a trustworthy person, but there were occasions'' when there were questions `` about some of the things he told us,'' <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> said after pausing. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> then read portions of <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON>'s grand jury testimony in 1987 in which he said that `` with Colonel North you never could be certain if what he was telling us was true or fantasy or deliberately meant to mislead. `` My practice was to take everything with four grains of salt,'' <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> testified to the grand jury in 1987. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> also revealed that <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> made no mention in his 1987 grand jury appearance of his assertion Monday that <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had designated <PERSON> North </PERSON> as the man who would assist the Contras. <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> defended the omission by saying he was n't asked about it. But <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> read questions from the prosecutor at the time in which <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> was asked for all details pertaining to meetings concerning the Contras. <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> stuck to his story that no prosecutor had asked him about the meeting, despite <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>'s suggestion that <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> was either inventing the testimony about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or had covered up in 1987. `` Mr. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> ... said he had discussed this with the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... and this was how it should be handled,'' <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON>, one of the first witnesses called by <PERSON> North </PERSON>, is the first to state outright that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had chosen <PERSON> North </PERSON> to work for the Contras. <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> was also one of the first witnesses called by <PERSON> North </PERSON> as the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide began his defense Monday on charges of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials about his role in assisting the Nicaraguan rebels. At the meeting in <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s office, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director said <PERSON> North </PERSON> as an <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staffer would n't be subject to a congressional prohibition on aiding the Contras, <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> was to become the `` principal point of reference,'' according to <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies from assisting the Contras as of October 1984. Former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> has testified he was the one who directed North and an <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> colleague `` to do everything they could'' to keep the Contras functioning and their morale up. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which investigated the Iran-Contra affair, on Jan. 26, 1987, that `` he did not know that the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff was engaged in helping the Contras.''

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The government said today it freed three military commanders who led a failed coup attempt. Mutinous soldiers surrendered control of the airport and returned to their barracks. State television announced Lt. Col. <PERSON> Himmler </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebu </PERSON>, commander of the Leopards Battalion; Col. <PERSON> Phillipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biamby </PERSON>, commander of the presidential guard; and Col. <PERSON> Leonce </PERSON> <PERSON> Qualo </PERSON>, an administrative officer at army headquarters, were given safe passage to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A government communique identified Rebu, <PERSON> Biamby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Qualo </PERSON> as leaders of what it called a `` foolhardy'' attempt Sunday to overthrow the government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. The president `` magnanimously'' decided to release the officers and they were escorted to the border of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> on Monday night to get a flight to an undisclosed city in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the communique said. <PERSON> Rebu </PERSON> was accompanied by his wife and four children. The government did not explain why the three men were freed, but the move was clearly meant to defuse resistance within the Leopards Battalion. At least four mutinous soldiers in the battalion were killed Monday in skirmishes with troops loyal to <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. The rebels were demanding <PERSON> Rebu </PERSON>'s release. Independent Radio Haiti-Inter said rebel units of the <ORGANIZATION> Leopards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> withdrew Monday night from the <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> airport, but the airport remained closed. Schools also were closed for a second day. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> assumed power six months ago in a coup led by non-commissioned officers who said they were disgusted by official corruption and human rights abuses. On Monday night, presidential guardsmen in tanks battled Leopards commandos on a main throughfare between the airport and downtown <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. Radio stations gave conflicting casualty reports, saying four to eight Leopards were killed and several wounded. Nine members of an independent council appointed to organize and schedule presidential elections were to be sworn in today, but the ceremony was postponed until Thursday because of the violence, officials said. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said in February he was forming the council, an announcement many Haitians welcomed as a sign of democratic times to come. The leader of this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation has promised elections and pointed as proof he is keeping his pledge to the council, which is to include representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, labor unions, the military, human rights groups, the media and judiciary. Rebel soldiers made three demands over <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti-Inter </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. They said they wanted <PERSON> Rebu </PERSON> released, a civilian government installed and total restoration of a 1987 constitution restricting the army's role in government. Those parts of the constitution were suspended in June. Radio Haiti-Inter cited sources close to the police command as reporting that <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> had determined a `` handful of soldiers and officers were involved'' in Sunday's coup attempt. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said on nationwide television early Monday that the coup was led by `` some members of the armed forces, blinded by their exhorbitant ambitions,'' but gave no details. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> was seized early Sunday by rebel troops, but rescued by loyal forces later in the day. No casualties were reported Sunday. There was speculation the coup attempt may have been linked to <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s crackdown on drug trafficking by the military. Last week, four high-ranking army officers were accused of drug dealing and arrested. The troops that installed <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> as president ousted Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> on Sept. 17, 1988. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> had led the country for most of the time since a February 1986 popular uprising forced dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> into exile, ending 30 years of <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family rule. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have conditioned the restoration of $ 70 million in suspended economic aid on <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> moving toward democracy, respecting human rights, and cracking down on the drug trade. The funds were suspended after thugs massacred 34 voters in November 1987, aborting <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s first elections in 30 years.

 Riot police firing tear gas charged onto a university campus and into a housing complex Tuesday to put down violent anti-government protests in two cities. In <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION>, about 150 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, thousands of workers hurling firebombs and rocks fought riot police to protest a crackdown on strikers at <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest shipyard, news reports said About 3,000 riot police stormed a complex of 150 high-rise apartments, a stronghold of militant stikers, after battling 5,000 workers and radical students on the streets, according to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>. Television footage showed protesters yelling and throwing rocks and firebombs from apartment balconies and roofs. Rocks rained down on police, who retaliated with tear gas. The Korean Broadcasting System said police retreated after several hours of battles that left about 60 police and workers injured. Police gave no figures on arrests or injuries in the six days of protest. Fighting has taken place daily in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> since March 30 when 14,000 riot police stormed the shipyard to end a 109-day strike by 5,000 of the company's 19,500 workers who broke off from the company union. Militant workers demanded more pay and better working conditions. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> officials say non-striking workers have been assaulted and attacked leaving the yard and the workforce has steadily declined. On Tuesday, about half the workers showed up. Stores, banks and schools near the shipyard must close part of every day as fighting erupts. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> officials worry the labor unrest will spread to subsidiaries. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest conglomerates, makes cars, steel, electronics and other products, and employs 100,000 people in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION>. Radical students attacked four <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> offices in three cities, burning two cars and breaking windows, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. In western <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police in visored helmets stormed the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, firing tear gas to disperse an anti-government rally by 1,000 students. In the last two years, police have stayed on the perimeters of colleges and fought students mostly in and around school gates. The students burned an effigy of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, then drove police back by hurling firebombs and rocks. They shouted: `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who blocks unification and stifles workers' rights!'' The fighting continued about an hour, and police said more than 400 students from other colleges were arrested for trying to enter <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> to take part in the protest after school gates had been sealed off by thousands of police. One student was injured in the head by police hurling rocks. The students were protesting the police action in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> and supporting the trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by a dissident, the Rev. Moon Ik-kwan. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s unauthorized visit has provoked controversy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where government officials say he was serving interests of communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. It has sparked a government crackdown on dissidents, with security officials arresting <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s colleagues and questioning others. Security agencies and police raided dissident offices and homes Monday. Dissidents alleged the government was using <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s trip as an excuse to crack down on dissent. Radicals students are a vocal minority with little public support.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> finished pumping 42 million gallons of crude oil from the crippled Exxon Valdez today and planned to refloat the tanker 12 days after the wreck that caused the nation's worst oil spill <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plans to refloat the tanker Wednesday and take it to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, for repairs, but port officials there said they were uncertain about accepting it, even though the $ 12 million repair bill would provide about 200 jobs. `` We're not willing to trade in the environment for jobs,'' port spokesman <PERSON> Darrel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buttice </PERSON> said Monday. The 1.1 million barrels of oil remaining after the accident have been pumped from eight ruptured tanks into three ships over the past week. Exxon Shipping President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said boats and booms will tag along as the tanker is refloated to prevent any spread of residual oil. Exxon Valdez Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who was fired and charged with being drunk at the time of the disastrous accident, made plans to surrender today near his hometown of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> State Trooper <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, is accused of misdemeanor charges of operating the ship while under the influence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. On Monday, the spill forced officials to close the $ 12 million herring fishery for the season. The fishery is where fishermen go after herring just as the fish are about to spawn at the start of the Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> fishing season. More than half the herrings' spawning habitat was polluted. `` It means they do n't have a fishery, and it means they have to come up with another means of making a living,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cordova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. The fishermen will be eligible for compensation from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. Other fishermen, meanwhile, worried that the spreading slick will shut down even more lucrative salmon fishing this summer. The region's fishing industry is worth $ 150 million a year. The ship has leaked oil since the Good Friday accident, when the vessel crashed into <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> and spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil. Fishermen have formed the backbone of the cleanup, using their boats to pull containment booms across bays near salmon streams and sensitive fish hatcheries. At <LOCATION> Sawmill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the hardest-hit hatchery in the sound and home to 2 million salmon, currents pushed oil against the booms. A light sheen made its way past barriers. The hatchery holds more than 2 million salmon fry, which can be poisoned by small amounts of oil. Hatchery manager <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestegard </PERSON> said they may have to airlift the fish fry to clean water, a double whammy to fishermen who fund the hatcheries through surcharges on their catch. More than 1,000 seabirds and at least 30 sea otters caught in the oil have died. Some were found covered with asphalt-hard oil. Officials said the death toll is probably much higher, but they have had time to survey only a small portion of the sound's 2,500 miles of coastline. `` Every day, it's getting a little worse,'' otter rescue specialist <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON> said as he squatted by a dead duck. `` You clean a beach up, the tide changes, and the oil comes right back.'' Department of Fish and Game spokesman <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> said a deer found dead on <LOCATION> Naked </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> about 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> apparently had eaten contaminated food, an indication of how rapidly the spill was spreading. `` That's bad news. That's the top of the food chain,'' <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> said. On nearby <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, hundreds of birds lay along the beach, as black and lifeless as the oil-smeared rocks around them. In other developments: _ Flow through the pipeline was increased, but remained below normal levels The accident forced restrictions on tankers in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> harbor, the only port for the Trans-Alaska pipeline, which carries nearly one-quarter of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' domestic supply of crude oil. _ In an interview in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said he hopes the `` emotional type of atmosphere'' generated by the spill does not prompt <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reject the oil industry's request to drill in protected wildlife areas That's exactly what could happen, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> suggested in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` If the image of an uncareful and uncaring industry prevails among the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public, then we can kiss goodbye the domestic oil and gas development in -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, offshore and in the public lands,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said. _ Rep <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee with jurisdiction over the pipeline, planned to fly to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to examine the damage from the spill, which has grown larger than <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> `` The oil spill has raised many serious questions about the ability of the industry to safely operate in a fragile environmental area,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> will consider legislation that would allow exploration for more oil on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, a champion of oil exploration in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, asked that plans for drilling in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the state's richest fishing grounds, be set aside until the industry can demonstrate that it can respond effectively to spills `` The Exxon Valdez accident has taught us that simply having a plan is not sufficient,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said. Oil is so thick that walking on once pristine beaches is treacherous, and workers wear hardhats to protect against injuries from frequent tumbles on rocks. Beaches smell like gas station garages.

 A child molester serving a 34-year prison sentence is suing his victims, alleging he is unable to find a new job and has suffered humiliation, anxiety and loss of health. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Booz </PERSON>, 62, filed a $ 2 million damage lawsuit March 28 in state district court. Defendants include two youths he was convicted of molesting. Other defendants include a boy whose allegations were rejected by a jury and members of at least two of the boys' families. <PERSON> Booz </PERSON> alleged that he lost his job as a salesman and can not find a new job in his field because of a conspiracy and accusations by the people he sued. He alleged he has lost earnings and earning capacity `` into the indeterminate future'' and has suffered `` extreme humiliation, anxiety and loss of health.'' District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said he would defend the families. He said he `` will not allow a convicted child molester to revictimize the victims. ...

His conviction was upheld on appeal.

 A domestic jetliner carrying 130 people crash-landed in flames at a jungle airport, the government news agency said today. It said 14 people were injured, but reported no deaths. The <ORGANIZATION> Faucett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 crashed at 6:43 p.m. Monday at the airport in <LOCATION> Iquitos </LOCATION>, after a flight from <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, 715 miles away, the <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The jet tilted sideways before touching down on the runway, and one engine burst into flames, <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION> said. The nose of the aircraft rammed into the runway and both wings tore off as the jet skidded off the runway. <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION> said the 130 passengers and crew members scrambled off the jet _ some leaving the plane before it came to a halt _ as flames reached the fuselage. Fourteen people were injured, some with second-degree burns and others as a result of jumping from the plane, the agency said. The body of the jet was destroyed by the fire, it said. Officials at <LOCATION> Iquitos </LOCATION> airport blamed the crash landing on `` unfavorable climatic conditions and strong tropical rains,'' <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION> reported. Repeated calls to <ORGANIZATION> Faucett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> went unanswered today.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Frigid weather chilled <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Tuesday, bringing <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> its first snowfall since the winter of 1987-88. The blustering cold followed days of balmy weather crowned by spring blossoms that started sprouting a week ago as temperatures soared to the 70s. Tuesday's early morning temperatures hovered around freezing in the northern half of the country with gusts of wind reaching 30 mph. The snow coated trees and lawns but did not disrupt morning traffic because it melted as soon as it hit the streets. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> weather bureau said the impression that a cold wave had struck stemmed from the contrast between the freezing temperatures and the warm weather last week. Forecasters said snow and cold temperatures are normal for early April in the northern part of the country. In the south, in <LOCATION> Provence </LOCATION> and along the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>, where there was concern about the lack of moisture, one-half to nearly 2 inches of rain fell in the past 24 hours. Rain also fell in the Pyrenees along the Spanish border. In the English Channel, winds gusted up to 50 mph and waves of 20 feet were reported off the <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Snow and sleet hit <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, chilling residents who also had been enjoying warm weather. Temperatures dropped to 36 degrees and the winds picked up. Over the weekend, Belgian beaches saw the first sunbathers in swimsuits and the public parks were full of families enjoying 68-degree temperatures. But on Tuesday, the weather office reported more than an inch of snow _ the first in more than a year _ in central <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Forecasters said temperatures were expected to warm up again later this week.

 A barge loaded with 160,000 gallons of lye ran aground and capsized in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, but officials said there was no immediate threat to wildlife or water supplies. The barge was one of 15 being transported by a tugboat around a sharp bend when it broke away and ran aground near the rocky shore, said Lt. Commander <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>. The accident occurred about 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Parkersburg </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bottom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Murraysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, near where a barge also carrying lye ran aground two years ago A salvage expert from <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the barge's owner, was expected to arrive at the scene today, <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said. Cleanup and removal of the barge was expected to take weeks. No leaks were detected, <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said, but small amounts of the lye solution, known as sodium hydroxide or caustic soda, may be seeping through vents in the barge. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maehler </PERSON> said this morning that preliminary water tests showed little of the lye had escaped the barge. <PERSON> Lye </PERSON> is considered hazardous because it is highly alkaline. In high concentrations such as the amount the barge was carrying, lye will burn skin and eyes and can be dangerous if swallowed, <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said. `` Drinking water could be infected, so water intake users downstream have been notified,'' <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said. Because of the swift current, it would take a major leak to endanger aquatic life or drinking water, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION>'s field staff supervisor. `` If there was any significant leakage, we would have seen some dead aquatic life,'' <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> said. `` There did n't seem to be any.'' The accident did n't tie up river traffic, officials said. Workers kept the upturned hull of the barge illuminated throughout Monday night, <PERSON> Maehler </PERSON> said. Strong currents were blamed for the April 9, 1987, grounding of a PPG barge with 200,000 gallons of lye. No leaks were reported from that incident.

<TEXT>
 The fight to save oil-fouled Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>'s $ 100 million salmon run from ruin comes down to a fish hatchery tucked away in this pretty little bay. `` If we lose <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatchery </LOCATION>, we lose it all,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, the acting president of <ORGANIZATION> Cordova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquaculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, because it is close to the oil-free waters of the ocean, has the best chance of any to survive and produce the pink salmon needed to replenish the oil-killed stocks, <ORGANIZATION> Lamb </ORGANIZATION> said Monday That's why 25 fishing boats and sleepless crews from the fishing town of <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> are struggling to hold back the huge river of crude oil coursing past the bay. The fishermen, increasingly equipped with booms, oil vacuums, and supply vessels from the state and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, have laid four miles of boom across the bay since they started a week ago. Still, currents pushed oil against the booms Monday, and a light sheen made its way past outer barriers. Al Rule is among the fishermen who move along the booms in skiffs, keeping them lined up against the oil. `` This hatchery is our meat and potatoes,'' said Rule, `` so I know we got to save it. ... `` But I still think about what I'd be doing if there was n't an oil spill and I was n't doing this. I'd be fishin' right now, I'd be herring fishing if it was n't shut. That's my spring money, my start-up money there, and that's what I'd like to be doing.'' The fierce determination of people like Rule is the reason <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> will survive the oil tide, predicted <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kegler </PERSON>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> official helping the efforts. `` We'll make the booms hold and we'll beat the oil.'' The hatchery, nestled alongside rickety gray wooden docks in the sound's southwest corner, is one of five hatcheries that supply an average of 50 percent of the millions of pink salmon that surge each summer through the sound. <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> said only <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> has a chance now. The others, further north in a chain of islands, will suffer due to their distance from clean ocean waters. Their hundreds of millions of salmon fry must feed and swim much further through oil, and have less chance of surviving, he said. Even small amounts of the toxic oil can poison the fry. `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> is the linchpin of the salmon fishery here,'' <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> said. Other fisheries, meanwhile, are quietly shutting down for the year, victims of the spill. The last casualty came Monday when the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game closed the region's $ 12 million to $ 15 million herring season. Last week, the sablefish and shrimp fisheries were shut. Officials have until May 1 to decide on releasing the salmon fry. The salmon runs begin in late June and early July. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurske </PERSON> of nearby <LOCATION> Chenega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> thinks it will take more than one hatchery to save the fishery, much less his way of life. `` Nobody's going to buy the fish. They'll be scared of the oil,'' he said. <PERSON> Gurske </PERSON>, who lays boom now, is a fisherman married into an <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> native family. `` We go hunting seals to sell to make our income in the winter. We catch halibut, bottomfish, salmon that we put up for the winter. We go out and get our meat, our deer. Now all this is going to stop because of the oil spill. This thing is going to hurt all life out there,'' <PERSON> Gurske </PERSON> said. Clomping along the dock in heavily oiled boots, he said: `` I do n't know what's going to happen. ... Now we're going to have to buy the food, and we do n't know how we'll do it. `` It's a mess.''

 Macho muscle shirts clash with drippy, high-water pants at `` Jocks and Nerds,'' a fashion exhibit that celebrates and spoofs 20th-century men. The two stereotypes are among 12 categories being explored through May 16 in an exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION> Fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> that shows `` how men create images for themselves,'' said curator <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. Mannequins are transformed into jocks, nerds, rebels, workers, cowboys, military men, hunters, sportsmen, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> College </PERSON>, businessmen, men about town and dandies. A man's clothing reflects his personality, although `` perhaps not in a purely conscious way,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` Someone can be a businessman five days a week, but on Saturday he puts on his safari jacket and becomes the <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` At night, he goes to a downtown club and becomes a rebel.'' Or perhaps a jock _ depicted here in photographs of <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> as `` Rocky,'' a reclining <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> pitching Jockey underwear, and a comic book outlining <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON>' rise from 97-pound-weakling to he-man. `` Jocks go in and out of favor. In the late 1960s and early'70s, the anti-establishment time, jocks were portrayed as dumb,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. But they are always perceived as sexy. `` Indeed, the classification of men's underwear into jockey and boxer shorts, both alluding to sports, seems to imply that the sanction of athletics is required for manly attire,'' notes the `` Jocks and Nerds'' catalog. Nerds have other qualities. The exhibit, noted <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, features `` our'80s nerd, complete with white socks, high-water pants and black glasses: beautifully made clothing that really respects the history of the nerd: the pattern mix, the ungainliness, the T-shirt under the open collar of a 1950s nylon shirt in a really icky material.'' A nerd, he said, might wear a short-sleeve shirt under a sweater vest, making `` his arms too cold and his chest too hot. It causes a real sense of discomfort and the nerd projects that.'' Nerds surfaced in the 1950s _ and a funny thing happened to them in recent years. `` The downtown club people suddenly started buttoning their top button and wearing high-water trousers,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. Also featured in the exhibit is a crowd of mannequins offering blasts from the past: a paisley Nehru suit; cowboy chaps made of sheepskin and skunk, on loan from the <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bill </ORGANIZATION> museum in <LOCATION> Cody </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>.; loud pants patterned with golf tees and balls, once favored in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>; and a black velvet suit with bellbottom pants _ donated by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who `` ca n't believe I wore that.'' And <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> pointed out a collection of `` great, bizarre ties'' with pictures of hula dancers, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, cocker spaniels, horses. `` There are always some men who are quite conventional but who will buy the most extraordinary ties,'' he said. The clothing was borrowed, gleaned from staffers' attics and scrounged at flea markets. `` We were real crazed flea-market shoppers. We'd get there the minute the doors opened,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who usually hates to shop but discovered he would `` go wild and become the worst sort of grabby shopper'' while building the collection. He said it's believed to be the first exhibit of 20th century men's clothing. `` Most museums have collected great women's clothing but have very little concern for men's clothing,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` It's very difficult to find historic men's clothing _ men tend to wear it until it wears out.''

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said today that he will abolish <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s special-assignment prison release program, which has been criticized since a furloughed inmate was accused of killing his ex-wife. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> also endorsed a recommendation from a seven-member Department of Correction panel to establish a bill of rights to better protect crime victims and witnesses. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> ordered the panel's study after <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was charged with fatally beating his ex-wife March 4 while on an eight-hour pass from the Correctional Industrial Complex in <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was serving an eight-year prison sentence for battering <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>. He now faces murder and burglary charges in her death and could face the death penalty if convicted on both counts. Authorities say neither <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> nor the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor were told that <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> would be released on a pass, despite their requests for notification. The panel, led by corrections Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiken </PERSON>, recommended the abolishment of the special assignment program, which allows certain inmates who are not near the end of their prison terms to work in the community during the day. Those inmates also have been allowed unescorted leaves of up to 48 hours once a month. The panel also recommended tighter controls on eligibility requirements for other minimum-security programs and closer monitoring of offenders' criminal histories. `` The priority is to protect the public,'' <PERSON> Aiken </PERSON> said, noting that the corrections department is looking now at where the inmates who no longer qualify for prison release programs will be housed during the next `` 180-day crunch period.'' Almost 400 inmates involved in the three minimum-security programs will be sent back to the general prison population because of the `` drastically tightened'' eligibility requirements, <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said. The panel also recommended that offenders not be allowed to leave a work release center, except for employment or educational purposes, without a leave approved by the director. The panelists also suggested random telephone calls to ensure that offenders released into the community shortly before their terms are completed are following department rules.

<HEAD>Many Legislators Vote Against Autonomy for Free-Zone City</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A law giving one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s free-enterprise cities the right to make its own laws ran into unprecedented opposition in the legislature Tuesday, and after passage a member demanded a recount from the floor. Negative votes or abstentions were recorded on all nine laws or motions presented on the last day of the annual legislative session. All were approved by large margins. One of the most important measures give people the right to sue officials, but a Western legal expert said its purpose was to increase central control, not protect the rights of citizens. The law that caused the stir in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave special legislative freedom to <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>, a city in <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province. Most of the 2,688 deputies supported the bill, but 274 voted against it and 805 abstained in the greatest show of opposition since the legislature was established 40 years ago. Fellow deputies cheered when <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xunxin </PERSON>, representing <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, spoke out against the bill from the floor. He said the congress was usurping powers of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province and other cities also would demand autonomy. A woman deputy screamed for a recount but her demand was ignored. A third member strode to the microphone after the vote to repeat his opposition. It was an unusual performance in a legislature that customarily rubber-stamps Communist Party policies, but was more indicative of the session's conservative tone than of a new independent spirit. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders stressed to the congress that power must be recentralized, but the new law does the opposite in <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>, one of the Special Economic Zones where most capital is foreign and most products are intended for export. At last year's congress, by contrast, legislators made bold statements about the necessity for ambitious economic reform. This year, the reform program started in 1978 to introduce market forces received several setbacks and political reform was put on hold. Human rights was labeled `` an abstract concept'' and control of the state-run press was tightened. At the start of Tuesday's session, the legislature approved a report given by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> on opening day, March 20. It stressed the need for social stability and a return to centralized economic power. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s report was a reaction to such economic problems as record annual inflation of 36 percent, widespread corruption and scarcity of staple goods. He recommended at least two years of austerity and restoration of government controls over some aspects of the economy. Other reports approved by the legislature put new taxes and restrictions on fledgling private and collective enterprises, the most active part of the economy. Deputies also passed a budget equivalent to $ 77.2 billion that devotes more money to education and agriculture and has a deficit equal to about $ 2 billion. In its resolution approving the premier's report, the congress called for stronger central management and adherence to such ideals as socialist morality, collectivism, thrift and hard work. Members made 120 changes in <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s report, most of them minor. One that requires feasibility studies for major policies apparently was designed to keep powerful ministers from making decisions recklessly. Another change revives a model-worker program, which seems to be a step back toward the days when portraits of `` Socialist Worker Heroes'' adorned post office walls. The law allowing citizens to sue the government takes effect in October 1990. It gives people the right to sue officials for specific acts but not to challenge laws or regulations. A Western legal expert who attended the congress said its aim was to further centralization of power by using the threat of legal action to restrict the often wide powers of middle-level officials. He said it is not designed to protect the rights of citizens even though it is couched in such language. `` If an official follows the state's laws and regulations then he is immune, but if he ignores those regulations someone might bring him to court,'' he said. `` That is the message here.'' As with the opening session, 84-year-old senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> was absent. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said he excused himself to preserve his health.

 Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said today it's time to `` change bullets for ballots'' in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but that can not be done without the support of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Following a meeting in the Oval Office with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> praised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for finding a joint executive-legislative compromise on a program of almost $ 50 million in aid for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. `` Now people here can talk with one single voice,'' he told reporters gathered in the White House driveway following his nearly hour-long meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I think, this time, they are, indeed, in good faith trying to support the efforts of the five Central American presidents to reach democracy and peace at the negotiating table.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who is visiting President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, must persuade <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> not to support guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> if `` he supports sincerely the Central American peace plan.'' `` War has taught us ... that violence is not the solution,'' he said. `` I think we have learned that we must change bullets for ballots, and we can not do this without the support of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paused amidst a series of meetings with <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> leaders to get an update on the Central American situation from <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace prize two years ago for his mediation efforts in the region. Neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor his guest would answer reporters' questions during a picture-taking session at the outset of the Oval Office meeting. Press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters the two `` had a very friendly and productive discussion.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> asked for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance in helping to negotiate loans with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to pay off Costa Rican debts, and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agreed to look into that. On Central American policy, the spokesman said that `` our fundamental common ground'' with <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> is the two countries' interest in democracy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` Both presidents agreed that their goals were ... demobilization of the Contras and repatriation into their country,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He also said reported remarks by Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Ge4rasimov </PERSON> about Soviet opposition to `` export of revolution'' were `` very encouraging in terms of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the comments `` could be very significant if they mean the reduction of Soviet military support in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or if they mean that Soviet surrogates would cease supporting'' leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The talks with <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> come more than two weeks after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and bipartisan congressional leaders announced agreement on the new humanitarian aid plan. Taking reporters' questions at the conclusion of his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said it was crucial that the repatriation of the counter-revolutionaries occur simultaneously with the institution of democratic reforms by the Sandinista government headed by President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. Otherwise, he said, `` you can not persuade the Contras to go back to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> ... if you have nothing for them there. You need a big carrot.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> noted that there long had been arguments about whether the Contras should lay down their arms following democratization moves by the Sandinistas, or whether they should be dismantled as a fighting force before such steps are undertaken. `` I think this should be simultaneous,'' he said. `` With repatriation there should be a democratic climate in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or there is no reason for them to go back.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, however, said he told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> he was concerned about how free elections could be achieved in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, noting there had been no such elections there in some 50 years. `` I am really worried as a Costa Rican about the organization of the next elections,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged last Friday that there was `` not a snowball's chance in hell of getting a dime'' of military aid for the counter-revolutionaries The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is demanding, as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration did for eight years, that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> make good on promises of democratization they made to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1979, at the time they overthrew the dictatorship of <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. In the meantime, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> is pushing a new plan aimed at dismantling the Contras in exchange for free and open elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by February 1990. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> scheduled the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> visit while passing through en route to an official visit to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, said White house press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last Friday that by getting humanitarian aid `` that goes with this -LRB- February 1990 -RRB- election, I am hopeful that the Nicaraguans will go forward and do that which they give rhetorical support for _ but that which they've failed to implement and that means democracy _ free, certifiable elections.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance, shaped out of the fears of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> expansionism, turned 40 on Tuesday with Western officials expressing caution and uncertainty about the dramatic changes gripping the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, secretary-general of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will still remain a strong military power even if promised cuts are carried out in troops and military spending. `` The intentions of the current <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership ... are peaceful ones,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> told a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he said, `` does n't want to wage a war.'' But he cautioned, `` There is still a risk because intentions may change. We have no control over them. Personalities, leaders may change.'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>'s remarks capped a morning of ceremonies marking the signing of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> treaty on April 4, 1949, forming a security alliance that links the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with Western European nations. The Western nations joined the pact to unite against the threat of expansionism posed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the years following World War II. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s recent agenda of economic and social reforms and his promises of military cuts have diminished the public's perception of that threat and raised questions about <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s role. Anniversary speeches, celebrations and a few protests held elsewhere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> reflected the new situation. British <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON>, in a speech at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> offices north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, credited the alliance with helping bring about `` the long overdue changes'' under way in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Five members of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated outside the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> complex, undeterred by a rare spring sprinkling of snow. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials served them hot tea. In <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> called <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> `` the most successful alliance we know'' and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Thorvald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> called it `` more important than ever.'' A small group of protesters in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> deputy <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattioli </PERSON>, organized a conference called `` 40 Years Is Enough.'' They demonstrated outside the premier's office and particuarly objected to the scheduled relocation of a squadron of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 fighters from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. A naval exercise and marching bands marked the anniversary in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, while a few hundred peace activists staged a demonstration. No incidents were reported. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, former German defense minister, led off the outdoor celebrations at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters on an unseasonably cold day in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. Military bands from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> marched and played music before an audience of diplomats and military officials. The flags of the 16 member nations were unfurled against the gray sky. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> reminded the audience that the alliance was formed out of the post-war hostilities. `` Forty years ago,'' he said, `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> lay in ruins; the most terrible war ever conducted had left its bloody traces of destruction. ... Communist expansionism threatened to subjugate the whole of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The allies, he said, `` have once again reached a crucial and decisive historical junction'' as they did when they signed the treaty. `` The old post-war European order is on its way out,'' he said. `` The future is an open book full of challenges, opportunities and risks.'' West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party recommended on Monday that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In a statement, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> had secured `` the longest period of European peace since the Middle Ages. We must be thankful for that.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and 10 European nations _ <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> _ were the original <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> later joined the Alliance.

 Namibian policemen battling black nationalist guerrillas are combat-hardened fighters more accustomed to <PERSON> bush </PERSON> warfare than routine law enforcement. The black patrolmen and their mainly white South African officers wear military uniforms and move about in heavily armored personnel carriers equipped with machine guns. They have played a leading role in fighting guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> since a special police counterinsurgency unit was formed in 1979, 13 years after the black nationalist fighters began the war for independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Known as `` <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>'' _ the <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION> word for crowbar _ the unit officially was disbanded in January as a goodwill gesture after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to end its rule of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. However, most of <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>'s estimated 3,000 men were integrated into the regular police and were ready for combat when heavy fighting erupted Saturday as a cease-fire was suppposed to take effect. Guerrilla leaders accuse police of initiating the fighting by hunting down guerrilla units which had no intention of staging attacks. Under the U.S.-sponsored <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence, guerrilla and South African troops as well as those of the South-West African Territorial Force were to be confined to their bases from Saturday The territorial police force of 8,300 men was entitled to operate freely, with full responsibility for maintaining law and order during the transition to independence. More than 90 percent of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s policemen and soldiers of its territorial force are blacks. They are led by white officers, mainly South African. Most South African army troops in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> are white. <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>'s history is clouded with controversy. Its effectiveness is widely acknowleged, but many Namibians attribute its success to ruthlessness. Several dozen of its members have been accused of atrocities against civilians, although only a few have been convicted. <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> claims to have killed 2,812 guerrillas between 1979 and 1988 for the loss 132 black and 19 white members. Leaders of the guerrilla's legal political wing in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> describe <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> members as `` programmed killers'' who will be required to undergo `` reorientation'' if the guerrillas win independence elections. Defenders of <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> say the criticism is tacit acknowledgement of the unit's prowess. `` Counterinsurgency work is not very easy, and sometimes things get a little tense,'' Koevet commander Gen. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> said last month. `` But without the support of the local people, we would not have had any success.'' In a standard <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> operation, four armored personnel carriers with 10 blacks and a white commander each would head into the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> for a week at a time, questioning villagers and looking for traces of guerrillas. <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> trackers sometimes would follow a trail for days, even crossing into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where most of the guerrillas are based. Most Namibian policemen are recruited in the north of the country among the Ovambo people who are famed for their tracking and other bush skills. The guerrillas almost always were on foot, and often were mismatched when overtaken by the personnel carriers or by helicopter gunships which <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> would call in.

 The federal deficit should not be an obstacle to serving all handicapped and disadvantaged students eligible for help under federal programs, the president of the nation's largest teachers union said Tuesday. `` I do not believe that the children of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> created the deficit,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the 1.9 million-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The organization is calling for an extra $ 10 billion in federal education spending to counter `` a shocking erosion'' in services under four major programs for disadvantaged students, low-income college students, handicapped students and students with limited proficiency in English. In a report called `` Federal Education Funding: Present Realities and Future Needs,'' the group says many federal programs reach only a fraction of those they are meant to serve. Serving all students currently eligible for the four programs would cost more than $ 10 billion, it says. `` I'm not an expert so I ca n't say where we would get the money,'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said at a news conference. But she said the union has offered to sit down with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to look at the overall budget and re-arrange priorities. `` We are aware of the fact that we ca n't do this in one year,'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said. `` It might take five years or 10 years. But what's important is that we recognize the problem ... and make the commitment to fully fund these programs in 1993 or 1998. The report looks specifically at Chapter 1, grants to bolster basic skills among disadvantaged younsters; the Education for All Handicapped Act, which helps states educate disabled youngsters; bilingual education, grants to make sure students with native languages other than English succeed in school; and <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> grants for college students from low-income families. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> reported the following statistics: _ Chapter 1 The number of students served declined from 7 million in 1980-81 to 5.7 million in 1988-89. The program reached 65 percent of eligible students in 1980-81 but only 40 percent by 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provided $ 4.6 billion for Chapter 1 in fiscal 1989, enough to serve 47 percent of eligible students. To serve the estimated 8.5 million who will qualify next year would cost about $ 6.9 billion, a $ 2.3 billion increase over current levels. _ Handicapped The federal share of costs to local school districts started at 12 percent 15 years ago and was intended to rise gradually to 40 percent. Instead it stayed at 12 percent until 1980 and has fallen to 7 percent today. To reach the 40 percent target would cost $ 8.4 billion, a $ 6.5 billion hike over current levels. _ Bilingual education Such programs serve one in 18 of students who need help in English skills. An increase of more than $ 1 billion would be needed to serve all 1.6 million students states say are eligible. _ Pell grants Such funds have increased slightly when adjusted for inflation, but the increases have not come near matching the soaring costs of postsecondary education. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has `` fallen far short'' of meeting its own authorized maximum fore individual grants. Some $ 600 million would be needed to fully fund the maximum $ 2,900 Pell grant permitted in fiscal 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> report was based on charts provided by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, an independent statistical analysis firm, and statistics from government agencies including the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Navy Delays Trident 2 Test After Failure</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has postponed its April test shot of the Trident 2 missile to give investigators more time to find the cause of last month's failure, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman said Tuesday. The spokesman, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, declined to provide a tentative date for the rescheduled test beyond saying it would probably be in early May. He said the delay did not necessarily mean the entire test program for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest and most potent weapon had suffered a serious setback. `` We're talking about a mechanical problem of some sort, and the broad evaluation by experts is that mechanical problems are easier to solve than some other types of problems,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` The analysis to date of the telemetry data indicates that the missile control was lost due to a mechanical failure in the after end of the first-stage motor. Until the investigation is completed and the extent of the corrective action is determined, we simply can not assess the impact on the overall program.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> further disclosed on Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had discovered a large `` debris field'' from the failed test _ on the bottom of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> at a depth of about 2,500 feet. Parts of the first-stage rocket motor have been sighted, he added. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation began March 21, shortly after a Trident 2 missile fired from the submarine <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> blew up just four seconds after launch. The missile popped to the surface as planned and the first stage ignited properly, but then the missile began spinning like a burning pinwheel and exploded. It was the first submarine launch of the new long-range nuclear missile. According to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the first-stage rocket nozzles of the missile are supposed to swivel immediately after firing to put the weapon on a 19-degree angle of flight. Then another internal command is sent to the nozzles to straighten back up. Two motors are located in the missile's aft end to move the nozzles back and forth. In this case, the spokesman said, the nozzles never straightened after the second command. The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon that is the heart of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s naval nuclear deterrent, the Trident 1. The new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets up to 6,000 miles away. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says the new weapon is much more accurate than its undersea predecessors _ <ORGANIZATION> Polaris </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Poseidon </PERSON> and Trident 1 _ and can match the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though it is launched from a submerged, moving submarine.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s leading writers have formed a chapter of the international writers organization PEN and in their first action defended author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a newspaper said. The authors wrote that they condemned both insults to religious and ethnic feelings as well as demands for retribution, the literary weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> wrote in its latest edition. `` This is why we appeal for the revocation of the order for the murder of the English writer <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who has apologized for the insult to the Moslem religion,'' the appeal said. Iranian revolutionary patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has called for the death of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for what he considers insults to Islam contained in <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses.'' Iranian clerics have offered a bounty of $ 5.2 million for the death of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Members of the Soviet PEN organization include poets <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Voznesensky </PERSON>, novelists <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chengiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aitmatov </PERSON>, historian <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON>, playwright <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON> and others. <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviet PEN chapter would be open to professional writers who are well known within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as well as outside it. Several leading Soviet writers, including <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON>, were observers at the <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> conference held in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> last fall, and decided to form a Soviet chapter when they returned home, the paper said. It said <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> was founded on the principle of `` strengthening the cooperation between writers of all countries, independent of their political views, in the interests of literature, free speech and good will in relations between peoples.'' Soviet writers are feeling more freedom under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost'' or greater openness, which has led to the publication of many works that previously had been banned.

 The massive Alaskan oil spill could put the brakes on petroleum exploration there and in other areas _ at least temporarily _ Environmental Protection Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said today. `` We will take apart the environmental planning for every aspect of oil development in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and in other sensitive areas where the environment potentially could be threatened.,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee Asked by Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Traxler </PERSON>, D-Mich., if the disaster in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> would prompt a re-evaluation of the environmental threat posed by oil development policy, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> added: `` We are doing that, as you know, off the coast of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> - looking at three proposed lease sales there for oil and gas that appear to have significant environmental concerns associated with them We'll do it in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and look very carefully at future contingency planning there. And we'll do it on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sslope </LOCATION>. I think we owe that to the environment. We owe that to common sense.'' Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, asked <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> if he meant that the administration would not move forward on a controversial proposal for oil exploration in the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> until a review had been completed. `` There is a very clear understanding that we will not move forward if we have any significant concerns that have not been resolved, yes sir,'' he responded. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>'s comments came just a day after <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said the oil spill off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> could become the petroleum industry's Three Mile Island if steps are n't taken to assure the public that oil developers are capable of protecting the environment. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s remarks to an oil and gas industry conference Monday suggested the massive spill last month into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> by the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> could have long lasting effects on the petroleum industry if some public damage control is not undertaken. `` It takes a long, long time to recover from these things,'' said <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, comparing the Exxon Valdez spill to the accident a decade ago at the <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The nuclear industry has yet to recover from that accident. `` If the image of an uncareful and uncaring industry prevails among the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public, then we can kiss goodbye the domestic oil and gas development in -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, offshore and in the public lands,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> told a conference of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The group represents about 235 companies involved in offshore oil exploration and drilling. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, nevertheless, emphasized that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration continues to support `` environmentally sound'' oil development in the arctic refuge and declared, `` Unless we pursue a coordinated policy to develop this country's domestic energy sources, including offshore oil and gas, every American will pay dearly for our failure.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> generally has supported offshore drilling, but in one of his first steps as president ordered a review into the proposed sale of oil leases involving two areas off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast and one off the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> because of environmental concerns. On the spill from the Exxon Valdez, the worst oil tanker spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said inadequate recovery equipment likely prevented any chances of an effective cleanup within hours after accident. The vessel ran aground during the early hours of March 24 outside the port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` If it happened -LRB- again -RRB- someplace now you'd have the same disastrous situation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary told reporters after his speech to the petroleum industry group. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said a key lesson learned from the accident is that cleanup equipment and preparedness for such a disaster must be improved. `` We need to be a little bit more prepared,'' said <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>. `` ... I understand about 80 percent of the oil was lost in the first hour or two. I do n't know that we could ever have contained it. Maybe it got away too quick.'' Later he told reporters, `` The kind of equipment that we have -LRB- available -RRB- ... is n't enough to take care of a spill like this.'' He said it was found that floating containment booms broke and oil skimmers were of little help. The characterization that the cleanup effort was doomed within hours of the accident has been disputed by some <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> fishermen, who have complained that opportunities were missed when little was done while relatively calm weather prevailed for two days after the accident. Oil company officials have acknowledged they did not begin to deploy cleanup booms around the hemorrhaging tanker until at least 10 hours after the accident. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials have blamed some of the delay on the government for not providing an early go-ahead to use chemicals to disperse the oil, while fishermen and state officials have accused the oil company of misleading them as to their cleanup capabilities.

<TEXT>
 Rockets hit residential neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Tuesday, killing at least five people, Afghan and foreign sources reported. One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said up to 25 people may have died. His report could not be confirmed. At least six rockets were said to have landed in or near the <PERSON> Khair </PERSON> <PERSON> Khanna </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Wazirabad </LOCATION> sections close to the airport, which has been a frequent target of Moslem guerrillas fighting the Soviet-sponsored government. It was the biggest rocket attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> since five struck the airport March 14, wounding two people but causing no serious damage. Last summer and fall, before Soviet military forces left, 20 or more rockets often hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> every day. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> completed its withdrawal Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement. Foreign sources said privately at least eight people were hospitalized Tuesday and another source reported 20 injuries. State TV showed a burning bus it said was hit by a rocket. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said guerrilla attacks on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 75 miles east of the capital, had weakened in the previous 24 hours. Reminded that the government had accused the U.S.-backed insurgents and Pakistani forces of massing men and arms for a new assault, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> added: `` It may be the calm before the storm.'' He said two Pakistanis captured 3 -LCB- weeks ago and accused of spying would go on trial Wednesday in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The Afghan government often accuses <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of military involvement in the civil war, but <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has denied it. Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978 and the most active groups operate from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s eastern border. Soviet soldiers entered the war in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began May 15, 1988. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jalaladad </PERSON> was `` relatively calm'' in the 24-hour period ending at sundown Tuesday. He described shelling of the city as `` sporadic and limited.'' Guerrillas besieged <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> on March 6 in their first major offensive since the Soviets left the Afghan army to carry on the fight alone. Government artillery and air attacks killed 85 of the enemy and wounded 48 in the past 24 hours, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. He gave casualties on the government side as two civilians and one soldier killed and two soldiers wounded. Casualty figures can not be verified. Government and guerrilla reports customarily exaggerate the other's losses and foreign reporters are not allowed into the <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> area. Most of the recent guerrilla rocket fire at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> has come from <LOCATION> Kama </LOCATION>, about 12 miles east of the city, and from <LOCATION> Surkhrod </LOCATION>, six miles to the west, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> told reporters. He said government forces `` opened firs and the enemy was forced to retreat.'' <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said most of the insurgents were 15 to 30 miles from the city. Several Scud-B missiles supplied by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were heard being launched Tuesday from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> toward <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, which is on the main road to the Pakistani border and near the Afghan end of the Khyber Pass. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the highway to <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> was open and an army convoy carrying food reached the city Monday. The Pakistanis to be tried were captured near <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in mid-March and shown to foreign reporters in <LOCATION> Kaul </LOCATION> a few days later. They identified themselves as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Afzal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> and said they were spying. Afghan law provides prison terms of 10 to 20 years for conviction on espionage charges, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Air Force Finds Lubricant Problems in Many B-1B Bombers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has discovered a problem with lubricant levels in a wing gear box on its B-1B bomber fleet that is slowing the return of the bombers to the air, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> had cleared the B-1B bomber fleet to return to flight status on Sunday as individual planes underwent a final safety check, and more than 35 of the planes would be flying Tuesday. During the course of the final safety checks, however, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> mechanics began discovering a problem with gear boxes that are part of the assembly to move the wings back and forth, the spokesman continued. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> now expects roughly 90 of the B-1B's to be certified for flight operations by the weekend The problem involves a loss of the lubricant contained inside a sealed gear box that handles what is known as the angle gear drive shaft, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. That angle gear drive shaft is a key component of the wing-moving assembly. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, of 80 B-1B's receiving the final safety inspection so far, 70 showed insufficient lubricant levels inside that gear box. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> denied Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had uncovered any evidence showing that a loss of lubricant in that gear box was the cause of a March 27 incident that led to a week-long grounding of the B-1B fleet. In that incident, a B-1B undergoing a pre-flight check at <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, suffered a tear in a fuel tank when the left wing swung too far forward. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> disclosed Tuesday that accident investigators probing the mishap had discovered a fractured `` quill shaft'' in a main wing gear box and a fractured `` angle gear drive shaft.'' Other sources, who insisted on anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> `` does now suspect that a lubricant seal problem led to the March 27 mishap,'' probably by allowing too much torque pressure to build up on the shaft. `` At first blush, that's exactly what we believe caused the wing to go too far,'' said one source. `` There's a very definite connection.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, referring to the two fractured shafts, said `` we do n't know what sequence those occurred in. `` We do n't know what the first cause was yet _ whether it was a procedural problem, a maintenance problem or a hardware problem. But simply in the course of investigating every possible problem that they could have had, they did discover this potential problem -LRB- with the lubricant -RRB-.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said the sealed gear boxes were manufactured by the <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and when mechanics were finding one with insufficient lubricant, it was being replaced and sent off to the contractor for repair. `` I think it's fortunate we had the incident at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> on the ground, because that led to the kind of detailed investigation that enabled us to catch something that we might not have caught,'' added one <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> source. The four-engine B-1B is the first addition to the manned bomber force in more than 25 years. To improve its performance, the plane features wings that can be swept forward or backward in flight. The wings are normally swept back for high-speed attack runs and forward for takeoffs and landings. Built by the <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the B-1B has a maximum speed of about 1,000 mph and a range of more than 7,000 miles. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> built 100 of the planes during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to modernize the old B-52 bomber force while it developed the new B-2 stealth bomber. Three B-1B's have been lost in accidents, leaving 97 in the fleet.

 Prosecutors demanded the death sentence Tuesday for a professed North Korean spy who told the court she wants to die to atone for killing 115 people in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner. Prosecutor <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-hyung </PERSON> also blamed North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> and `` the dictatorship in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for the grave crime of killing the passengers.'' It was `` an unpardonable crime to mankind,'' he said. Lawyer <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong-il </PERSON> argued his client, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon-hui </PERSON>, was `` forced to commit the act and it is someone else who needs to be punished _ <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, 27, was a `` scapegoat of the world's most isolated communist dictatorship,'' <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> said to yells of abuse from relatives of victims. `` Why do you keep her alive?'' some screamed. `` Kill her!'' Scores of other relatives were kept out of the courthouse by hundreds of police and security agents who ringed the building. In her final testimony, Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told the court: `` I am really sorry for relatives of the victims. I feel like dying to atone for what I did.'' She, too, blamed the Korean leader and his son and heir, whom she says ordered her to bomb the plane. `` I now curse <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> endlessly,'' she said, sobbing into a handkerchief. The verdict and sentence will be issued April 25. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> might deserve sympathy because she was a `` puppet'' of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and had repented. `` But as a signatory to the Montreal Convention that governs the safety of civil aviation, the Republic of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is obliged to severely punish the defendant without fail, irrespective of ideology,'' he said. <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> should be kept alive to counter <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s charges that she is a South Korean agent and that the bombing was a frame-up by <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> authorities Government officials have indicated Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> may get a presidential pardon because they say she was duped by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and has repented. She said on South Korean TV in January 1988 that she planted the bomb as part of a North Korean plot to disrupt the summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> denies involvement. Police explosives expert Lt. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon-Ho </PERSON> testified Tuesday that the mixture of explosives used in the bomb was so powerful it would have destroyed the aircraft in less than a second. `` There would be no time, no chance, to contact anybody,'' he said. Details of the bomb come from Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> since little plane wreckage was found. The <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 disappeared Nov. 29, 1987, on a flight from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Andaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> as it approached the Burmese coast. Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said she and another intelligence agent pretending to be Japanese tourists planted the bomb when they flew from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>. The pair were arrested in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> shortly afterward and attempted to take cyanide hidden in cigarettes. The other agent, an elderly man, died. But Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> recovered and was extradited to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>.

 Liquor was once as much a staple of a mariner's rations as bread, and sights of drunken sailors in port were tolerated as compensation for hard, lonely duty at sea But authorities said booze on board was banned by most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial shippers well before the Alaskan oil spill that happened after the tipsy skipper allowed an uncertified third mate to operate the tanker. `` The whole philosophy about drinking has changed. It's just not tolerated anymore,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Epler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s crisis action center. `` Any hand who's drunk aboard a vessel makes it unseaworthy,'' said <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Guastella </PERSON>, who set up an alcohol rehabilitation program in 1977 for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a black eye to the American merchant marine.'' Federal regulations that took effect in January 1988 prohibit commercial operators from having 0.04 percent alcohol in their blood. Drinking is also prohibited four hours before going on duty. Authorities said Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> had a 0.061 percent level nine hours after the Exxon Valdez lurched onto <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, gushing 10.1 million gallons of crude oil March 24 in the worst oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, was fired by the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which bans alcohol on its ships, even to crewmen who are off duty. The captain was twice arrested on drunken driving charges and his drivers' license was suspended three times. Captains are required on their shipping license applications to report arrests for driving while intoxicated. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was checked under new federal regulations that call for tests after a major accident. Federal officials had trouble finding a test kit, but a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> corpsman used one supplied by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. When asked by investigators what was the problem, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> said, `` I think you're looking at it,'' according to a court affidavit. One crewman also said `` his balance was not good,'' according to court documents. The new rules about drinking followed 20,604 commercial marine accidents involving drug and alcohol abuse between 1981 and 1986. Of the 1,114 deaths and 960 injuries from all causes during that time, 17 deaths and three injuries involved drug or alcohol use, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s case is the most serious since the rules went into effect. On Sunday, the crew of the Century Hope called the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> off <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, because it feared its captain was drunk. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 58, of Ealing, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, voluntarily submitted to a blood-alcohol test and is being investigated for being drunk at the helm. `` We have n't found a lot of instances where commercial operators have been intoxicated. It's come up a handful of times,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s casualty review branch. `` It's not widespread.'' Drinking on the high seas were once intertwined. Old refrains told about `` what do you do with a drunken sailor?'' and `` yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.'' In a tradition rooted in the rum-powered British navy, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors were given a daily ration of spirits called a grog with their bread, salt pork and peas. The practice was banned in 1862 when sailors were compensated for their loss, but a lament said, `` They've raised his pay three cents a day but stopped his grog forever.'' All booze was banned in 1914, when the blue-nosed teetotaler <PERSON> Josephus </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> as Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ended the custom of officers having wine in their quarters. He earned the bitter nickname `` Grape Juice <PERSON> Josephus </PERSON>.'' Aircraft carriers still have brandy hoarded by doctors for medicinal purposes, and ships can still be christened with a bottle of champagne. But a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in which thirsty hands once swallowed alcohol-based torpedo juice during World War II is officially dry. Federal regulations for drinking on pleasure boats are more relaxed. Pilots are allowed to have less than 0.1 percent alcohol in their blood, although booze was the direct result of 158 deaths and 135 injuries in 279 crashes in 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. Half of all pleasure boating accidents are thought to be related to drinking, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> estimated. `` It's much more stringent for operators of commericial vessels,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s public affairs office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` A tanker that has the potential of creating a major oil slick is more serious than going around a harbor erratically. It can affect an ecology or the lifestyle of a whole community for years to come,'' he said.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday urged guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to pull back into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and allow the Namibian independence process to get under way. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement came as fighting continued for the fourth day in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> between thousands of Soviet-backed <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and South African troops and local police. `` <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s intention apparently was to establish bases in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, in clear violation'' of a U.S.-brokered peace agreement signed last December. The pact, negotiated over two years by Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, calls for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to pull its troops out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to grant independence to neighboring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The agreement went into effect April 1 but was threatened by the fighting, which has claimed 180 lives, according to police figures that could not be independently verified. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not think the agreement is in danger of unraveling `` at this point.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats are still in touch with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, asking them to use their influence with <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> to restore calm in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, she said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, for its part, is asking <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to rein in its troops, who were scheduled to begin demobilizing Sunday once the peace agreement went into effect and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers were deployed. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> position is that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> must withdraw the forces it has sent into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to north of the 16th parallel in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. Under the peace agreement, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas were supposed to stay in their Angolan bases, about 100 miles north of the Namibian border. She said that despite rebel claims, there was no doubt that the guerrillas had crossed the border on Saturday. Guerrilla officials and the Angolan government claim the fighters have been in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for some time and fired in self defense after security forces attacked them. Villagers in northern towns, most of whom support the rebels, said they believe the guerrillas left <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to return home and did not expect a fight because the independence process officially has begun. Asked whether the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force, which has just 1,000 of its planned 4,650 soldiers deployed so far, should have foreseen the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> incursion, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> replied that `` hindsight is always great, but I do n't think anybody anticipated this.''

<HEAD>Shamir's Plan Centers on Elections But Palestinians Reject Terms</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Mideast, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The peace proposals Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will submit to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> focus on elections in the occupied territories to choose Palestinians who would negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited self-government. Many prominent Palestinians welcome the idea of balloting but argue that free elections can not be held as long as <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops occupy the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In interviews and through his aides, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he was willing to have Palestinians choose mayors to speak for major population centers or political figures to represent the whole region. The elected Palestinians would then meet with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> negotiators to work out a temporary solution for the 1 million residents of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the 650,000 inhabitants of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The most Palestinians could expect from this process would be limited self-rule with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops still stationed in the occupied lands. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has said troops could be pulled out of population centers once an autonomy scheme was agreed upon. Under <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposals, the final status of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would be the subject of further negotiations after autonomy was implemented. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s advisers also hint he is ready to release some Palestinian prisoners and take other steps to reduce tension. However, they link any change to a truce in the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising _ intefadeh in Arabic _ in which 419 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have died since December 1987. `` The condition is that life in <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> -RRB- must return to normal. The intefadeh must end,'' said <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman. The Shamir ideas closely parallel the 1978 U.S.-mediated Camp David Accords signed by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but rejected by the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. The major difference is that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposes electing negotiators before autonomy is implemented instead of members of an autonomous council after self-government is defined in talks. `` I believe that this will be the one big and important contribution that Mr. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is bringing to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official who described the proposal as a `` major change'' in the government's position. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, however, rules out direct or indirect talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which means elected representatives could not act as intermediaries. He gives Palestinians little hope of seeing an end to occupation because he has rejected <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demands for statehood and refused to endorse the idea of returning any captured land to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sovereignty. In this, the right-wing prime minister takes a harder line than Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the leaders of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> which shares power in the coalition government. Labor supports returning some of the captured land in exchange for peace agreements. Municipal elections have been held twice in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the land from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. In the last balloting in 1976, voters chose 23 mayors _ nearly all of them supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Only six remain in office with most of the rest having been deported or deposed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for nationalist activities. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, elections were last held in 1946, under Egyptian rule. The main flaw in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan is that he has been unable to find Palestinians willing to go along with the elections proposal. But some Palestinians have met secretly with the prime minister or openly with military officials to discuss the idea. <PERSON> Saeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>, a political science professor at the An <ORGANIZATION> Najah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, said that if, as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has proposed, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops withdraw and turn over the occupied territory to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers, `` then we will consider elections.'' He said electing city officials would be meaningless if occupation persisted. `` Will elected mayors be able to prevent arrests, stop the deportation of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders, halt the confiscation of land or the closure of schools? We would just wind up electing people who have the authority to collect the garbage,'' said <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>. Soon after the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began, a group of prominent Palestinians in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in January 1988 presented a 14-point list of demands that included a call for elections. The idea was hotly debated among Palestinians until <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> proposed a cease-fire in the intefadeh, or uprising, in exchange for elections and the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> responded by threatening to shoot anyone who proposed a truce and graffiti appeared on <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> walls threatening <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>'s life. Support for the idea rapidly waned. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of the pro-PLO daily <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION> and a proponent of the 14-point list, said there was deep suspicion that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was meeting with Palestinians and talking about elections in an effort to perpetuate `` the illusion that there are alternatives to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` So far, what we see from <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is an attempt to repackage what was refused earlier, autonomy under Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, a leading moderate.

 Many of those involved in the fight against AIDS are lauding cartoonist <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>'s comic depiction of the ignorance, unfounded fears and public indifference that sometimes surround the disease. `` Humor is essential for educating people,'' said <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Durazzo </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> AIDS Foundation. `` It gets them to look at themselves without a lot of harsh confrontations; gets them laughing at their own silly attitudes.'' In a three-week series of his Doonesbury strip that began March 27 and ends April 15, <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> is gently dishing up some rather biting comments on how the public and government have responded to the disease. Centered around a town hall meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, part of character <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>'s congressional district, the strip so far has poked fun at fears of getting AIDS through casual contact, the view that AIDS largely affects only homosexuals and the public's discomfort at dealing with various sexual issues raised in its context At one point, the 81-year-old <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON> finds herself unable to use the word AIDS, instead saying `` the great unpleasantness.'' A long-time character in the strip, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippincott </PERSON>, has developed AIDS. <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> told a columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, this week that he had a `` hard time finding the right approach'' to AIDS. `` I had to strip it -LRB- the disease -RRB- of its taboos to attack the fear and ignorance by laughing in its face,'' said <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>, who rarely grants interviews. He did not return a call placed by The AP. Brother <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Worth </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic monk who works with AIDS patients at <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Spiritual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>'s AIDS series an `` effective way of uncovering the public's ignorance'' about AIDS, which destroys the body's immune system. `` <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>'s unwillingness to name the issue represents a common response on the part of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public, much of which prefers that this disease simply did not exist, or would just go away,'' he added. `` <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> is showing us it will not.'' According to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, which distributes the comic strip, only one newspaper has refused to run the series. The Canadian paper, which he did not identify, considered the series in `` bad taste.'' In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where 9,000 people are expected to be living with the disease by the end of the year, the comic strip has been greeted with guffaws at numerous AIDS organizations. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, finance director of The Names Project, which produces a giant memorial quilt using panels submitted by survivors of people who have died of AIDS, is posting each segment of the daily strip on his door. But some involved in the fight against AIDS are surprised the often controversial cartoonist, known for his sharp political wit, has taken so long to address AIDS issues. `` I wish he had done this four years ago,'' said Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` Most of what I've seen so far is a little after the fact. These issues have been raised before.'' <PERSON> Carisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> of the Gay Mens Heath Crisis in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> feels it is appropriate that <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON> represents a sometimes ill-informed public and government officials who can be frustratingly prudish. `` He's addressing the issue of denial in <LOCATION> Lacy </LOCATION>, who in the past has been a sympathetic character,'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` We are n't meant to hate or despise her because of her ignorance. It's telling us that even well-meaning people are having a hard time dealing with AIDS.''

 Voters turned out in large numbers to elect a new mayor Tuesday as front-runner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> sought the office held by his father for 21 years and chief rival <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> battled to keep black leadership in City Hall. Maverick Republican <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> was not expected to be much of a factor in a contest Democrats have won without fail since 1931 _ including six straight terms captured by the late <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, last of the big-city political bosses. A victory by the younger <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who defeated Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> in February's Democratic primary, would make the nation's third-largest city by far the biggest in the nation to replace a black mayor with a white <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION>, said that turnout was substantial all morning and appeared headed for a rate of 71 percent of the 1.56 million registered voters. That would be the third-highest turnout for a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> municipal election, below the numbers that carried <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor, to victory in 1983 and 1987. There was no early breakdown of how the turnout compared in mainly white and mainly black precincts. The election was ordered by the courts to fill the two years remaining in the second term of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who died of a heart attack in November 1987. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, 46, is a three-term <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 45, is a Democratic South Side alderman who skipped the primary to run on the <ORGANIZATION> Harold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ticket. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, 51, is a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> alderman who has not won elected office since his party switch in 1987. A telephone poll released Monday by The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southtown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economist </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WBBM-TV </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> 51 percent to 35 percent for <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and 3 percent for <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who planned to visit the graves of his father and infant son, voted with his wife, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON>, at a day care center near his home, joking, `` Now I got two votes.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> cast his vote and followed it with another prediction of victory, saying, `` It's been a good struggle.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' most prominent supporter, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, also voted in the morning, noting Tuesday was the 21st anniversay of civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s slaying. `` This is not a day to throw bricks,'' he said. `` We must build with bricks.''

 Analysts agreed that turnout among black and white voters would be the critical factor. Whites make up about 48 percent of the voting population, blacks about 42 percent and Hispanics about 7 percent. But the black community that united around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> appeared bitterly divided this year between <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who refused to endorse each other. In the February primary, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> by more than 100,000 votes, in large part because many black <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> supporters stayed away from the polls. Tuesday was <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s second bid for the mayoralty. He lost in the three-way 1983 Democratic primary won by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> advanced into Tuesday's contest by winning the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary after a last-minute write-in campaign. Unpopular with blacks for his <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> opposition to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> generated little support in the general campaign. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> far outstripped <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vrydolyak </PERSON> in raising campaign funds, collecting a warchest of about $ 6.5 million. He also gained the endorsement of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s two largest daily newspapers. Like the primary, the general election was largely free of the rancor and racial strife that characterized <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s victories. But <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and his supporters openly appealed to black voters not to relinquish control of local government to whites. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urged the black community to `` keep the keys'' to City Hall. And <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> told a rally last week that <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was `` getting ready to reopen his father's plantation.'' Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a black and an ally of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s, endorsed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, a partisan move that angered some blacks.

 A Jewish refusenik whose emigration case had been pressed by British officials said Tuesday he was given permission to receive medical treatment in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The case of <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON> has been on a list <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> intends to raise with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who is to arrive in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` Undoubtedly, the two events are connected,'' <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON>, 66, said in a telephone interview. `` This is happening only thanks to the work of the two governments, the British and the American, and the work of my friends throughout the world.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said the action `` reflects a considerable achievement in Anglo-Soviet relations.'' The list Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> plans to discuss includes the wife of <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordievsky </PERSON>, a top Soviet spy who defected to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in 1985, officials confirmed Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> refused to say how many people are on the list. The Soviet decision came a day after a protest by about 40 refuseniks in front of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> who said they hoped the talks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> would help resolve their cases. <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON>, who has life-threatening lymphoma, first applied to emigrate in 1979. He was sacked from a defense-related job and the Soviets have refused repeated applications on grounds he was involved with secret work. <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON> argues that everything he knew is now public material. Officials of the Soviet visa office summoned him Tuesday and told him the prohibition on his emigration due to access to state secrets had been removed, <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON> said. Refuseniks accuse Soviet officials of applying regulations that allow them to deny emigration because of access to secrets in many inappropriate cases. He said he was told he would be allowed to leave for medical treatment in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and that his wife <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> and son, <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON>, would be allowed to emigrate after they submit new documents to Soviet officials. <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON> said he hoped to receive his international passport Wednesday or Thursday after using his internal Soviet passport to prepare legal documents testifying that the entire family wishes to leave. Once in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> he said he hoped not to return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but would wait in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for his family. The family hopes to settle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where it has close friends, <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON> has been offered free medical treatment both at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marsden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. A Geneva-based agency that helps to resettle Soviet Jews said Tuesday the number who arrived in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in March was 3,893, a 10-year high. But it said only 114, or 2.9 percent, wanted to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Most of the rest intended to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Reghina </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucault </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION>. Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reached a peak of 51,328 in 1979 but then dropped sharply and in the mid-1980s only about 1,000 a year were released. In the past two years, however, many long-time refuseniks have been permitted to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the number of emigres increased to more than 20,000 in 1988.

 Boa constrictors, anacondas and pythons are not uncommon pets, according to a resident who is suing to hang on to 16 of his household snakes that the city says are banned from dwellings. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, 26, says his snakes, the biggest of which is a 13-foot-long, green anaconda named <PERSON> Annie </PERSON>, never slither out of his apartment. City officials were tipped about the snakes by an anonymous caller in February, said <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Finazzo </PERSON>, an assistant city attorney. `` This is a multiresidential area, and we're not talking about some small garter snakes,'' she said. `` We have some serious pythons here.''

Common pets include cats, dogs and gerbils. `` Our ordinance is quite clear, and he's in violation of it,'' <PERSON> Finazzo </PERSON> said. Macomb Circuit Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Cashen </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order against the city last week and set a hearing for April 24 on <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>'s suit. <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, who has kept snakes since he was a child, defended his pets as quiet. `` It's not as bad as a kitty litter box,'' he said. <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Langton </PERSON>, says he knows one pet shop owner who sells 300 to 400 boa constrictors and pythons each year `` And that's just one store, so that puts -LRB- the big snakes -RRB- into the realm of common pets,'' <PERSON> Langton </PERSON> said. `` There's a lot of snakes out there.

 Although restaurant customers remain their top priority, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s premier chefs are catering more and more to charities that are capitalizing on the nation's appetite for fancy but healthy cuisine. `` It's a bit of an ego trip. To be able to say I had dinner last night with seven of the finest chefs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If this is what turns you on, it's a pretty big trip,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, board chairman at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The hospital has invited seven top chefs to dish out their best at a $ 1,500-a-person gourmet gala in October. Half the 100 dinner tickets already have been gobbled up, solely through word of mouth. The fund-raising crowd is `` getting bored with always eating meat and potatoes,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Banchet </PERSON>, chef and owner of <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francais </LOCATION> in Wheeling, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` They do n't eat garbage anymore. They know more and more about food, all kinds of food. They're more educated of the palate.'' <PERSON> Banchet </PERSON> is one of the chefs donating their talents for Children's Hospital, the world's leading pediatric liver transplant center. The hospital will launch its 1990 centennial celebration with the culinary extravaganza. At a preview luncheon Monday, <PERSON> Banchet </PERSON> showed off the mille feuille of duck liver with artichoke, truffle and toast brioche he will create in October. Cajun cook <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Prudhomme </PERSON> whipped up his offering, a creamy crawfish dish served in bread boats and called <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> seafood fantasy. The menu also features a consomme of wild mushrooms, grilled marinated quail, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> garden greens, saddle of lamb, and an apple dessert with kiln-dried cherry sauce and topped with a sugar dome. Gourmet chefs became highly sought after for these kinds of high-brow fund-raisers in the early 1980s, according to <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Forgione </PERSON>, chef proprietor of An American Place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It only came about because of the notoriety of chefs, for lack of a better word, the star quality of chefs,'' <PERSON> Forgione </PERSON> said. `` What would be the sense if the chefs who are here today had no influence? Why bother paying to come to this event?'' Top chefs say they are besieged with requests to donate their services. `` It's worthwhile doing and, hey, it's going to have a lasting effect. That money is going to pay for a lot of good things. That's why we do it,'' said <PERSON> Prudhomme </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> K-Paul </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Kitchen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> `` You can not say yes to all of them,'' said another guest chef, <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palladin </PERSON> of <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> at Watergate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Every day of the year, we would be doing that and we can not because we have our job to do.'' Whether it's for charity or for profit, chefs with any conscience are blending what people want to eat with what they should eat, according to <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. Under fire are high-calorie, high-cholesterol foods. `` It's not just the responsibility of the chefs to wait and say, ` Well, let's wait to see if they become more sophisticated,' `` said <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, who is baking the dessert for the gala. `` We have a responsibility to lead, and I'm actually somewhat disappointed in the lack of corporate responsibility that I see on the part of some of the fastfood people.'' Education is the main ingredient to healthy eating, and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> institute's 22,000 graduates are busy `` spreading the word,'' according to <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>. `` The message will get around,'' he said. `` It's an enormous undertaking, but I think we're making progress.''

 Rescuers on Tuesday pulled three more bodies from the wreckage of a train that derailed and slammed into a station in this southern city, bringing the death toll to eight. Authorities said 17 people were injured, one critically, in the accident Monday. Casualties occurred both on the train and in the station. Police identified the dead as the two train engineers, the chief of the station and two assistants, a railroad worker, a passenger on the train and a passenger in the station. The eight-car train derailed as it entered the station. Two cars slammed into the station wall, demolishing the bar, ticket booth, and freight and baggage section.

The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> reported the train was traveling at more than 60 mph. National Transportation Minister <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santuz </PERSON> ordered an investigation into the crash.

<HEAD>Lack of Public Affairs Programming Decried</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The rights of television viewers are being trampled by laissez-faire federal regulators who no longer require TV stations to broadcast public affairs programming, consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, appearing at a news conference to discuss a study that said there has been a 51 percent decrease in issues-oriented public affairs TV programs since 1979, called for reinstatement of the Fairness Doctrine and requirements that broadcasters devote certain percentages of their broadcasting hours to non-entertainment programming. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 repealed the 40-year-old Fairness Doctrine, which had required broadcasters to cover controversial issues. In 1984 the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> revoked rules that obligated broadcasters to alot 5 percent of their programming between 6 a.m. and midnight to local shows, 5 percent to news and public affairs programs and 10 percent to general interest items such as as gardening, religion and advice-type shows. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> under Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> and his predecessor, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, was a `` rogue agency that has dangerously transformed power from the public to private commerce in sheer violation of the -LRB- 1934 Communications Act -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>'s view was `` audiences have no First Amendment rights.'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, and now <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, maintained that marketplace pressures would force station owners to broadcast issues-oriented programs. That has not happened, <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said, and the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> refuses `` to respect the access rights, the response rights of the audience.'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has abdicated its responsibility to monitor the broadcasting industry and that if it had it would have found an erosion of public interest programming in the wake of the 1984 repeal of the so-called 5-5-10 guidelines. The study by Essential Information, a public interest group that <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> founded in 1982, examined TV listings for programs at 217 stations in 50 markets on seven days in early 1988. The listings were compared with FCC-required program logs from 1975, 1978 and 1979. The study did not include cable TV. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, who wrote the study, said, `` The results show a 51 percent decrease between 1979 and 1988 in the average percentage of issue-oriented public affairs programming.'' He also said that `` the average percentage of time devoted to public affairs has decreased 39 percent, with 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> affiliates and 63 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> affiliates neglecting to air a locally produced public affairs program.'' <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>'s study also showed there has been an 74 percent increase in news programs, and sharp increases in home shopping, real estate and program-length `` commercials'' such as how to lose weight or get rich. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said the report `` sounds terribly bogus. We have increased the number of stations over the last 10 years, both television and radio, by half and news and public affairs programming makes money. I find it incredible to think that the amount of this programming would go down. So I do n't know how he counted it, but I think it's subect to being recounted.'' Regarding the Fairness Doctrine, <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said the `` commission found that it decreased the amount of public interest programming available, ... which was the opposite of what it was intended to do.''

 People in five major <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> cities voted for mayor Tuesday, with <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> residents turning out in heavy numbers to decide whether <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> should inherit his father's job. Democrats fought to retain a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, residents voted on a non-binding handgun ban prompted by a shooting spree at a local elementary school last May. A woman carrying three handguns killed an 8-year-old boy and wounded several others before committing suicide. And just outside <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, two white supremacists were seeking local offices in a bitter contest in <LOCATION> Northmoor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Besides <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, cities where voters were choosing mayors included <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, seven mayoral candidates ran in a primary election to pick two finalists for the May 9 general election. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, voters considered whether to strengthen the power of their mayor's office. The only statewide race pitted an incumbent state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> against an appeals court judge who accused her of being soft on crime. A Democrat was favored to win the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> congressional seat left vacant by the death of Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>. Secretary of State <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Browder </PERSON> was considered the frontrunner in a rough-and-tumble race against Republican state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> for the 3rd District seat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, a Democrat and the son of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, led in pre-election polls against independent candidate <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>.

 Race was the underlying issue in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where elections tend to divide voters by color more than party. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, 46, the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney, captured overwhelming white support in the February Democratic primary to oust the city's second black mayor, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> had been appointed acting mayor following <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death in November 1987 His chief rival at the time had been <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a fellow black Democratic alderman who later formed the <ORGANIZATION> Harold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was supported in the primary election by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a Chicagoan who casts a long shadow in local elections. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> then abandoned the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee _ <LOCATION> Daley </LOCATION> _ to endorse <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 45, in the general election. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, 51, was the wild card in the race. The former Democratic alderman had been <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s arch-foe but has been unable to win elective office since switching to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. Although the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> race occasionally lived up to the city's feisty political tradition, it was tame compared to the bare-knuckle <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> congressional race <PERSON> Browder </PERSON>, 46, a former political science professor, adopted a get-tough strategy to counter <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>'s liberal-bashing. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 37, a real estate developer, had labeled <PERSON> Browder </PERSON> a liberal, a liar and a `` wimp.'' <PERSON> Browder </PERSON>, casting aside his image as a mild-mannered reformer, castigated <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> as an `` off-the-wall radical'' and ran television advertisements showing the Republican as a hand-grenade threatening to blast funds to the elderly in half.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> nuclear plant already off line because operators failed routine retesting was shut down completely after technicians discovered a tiny cooling-water leak, officials said Tuesday. The leak was found in the weld around a tube holding instruments that measure conditions in the core of the Unit 3 reactor, said <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. Several leaking and cracked tubes were found in the same location in January, forcing <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to shut the reactor down at that time as well. `` A weeping tube in and of itself normally is not serious, but a situation like this deteriorates, and the utility usually shuts it down,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Until the leak was discovered Saturday, Unit 3 had been on `` hot standby'' in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s discovery that half of the plant operators taking regular recertification tests had failed. The leak forced the utility to completely shut down the reactor. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> examiners are expected to review later in the week the performance of all the plant's reactor operators, a process that usually takes several days. Repairing the leak and retesting the reactor and the cooling-water system will delay Unit 3's restart even longer, utility spokeswoman <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. The utility originally had hoped to get the reactor back on line by the weekend, but the delays are likely to add another week, she said. `` We're moving along a step at a time,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. The other <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> Point reactor, Unit 4, is down for routine refueling and is projected to go back on line in mid - to late April, she said The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has hit <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> with about $ 1 million in fines over the past five years for safety and security violations, identifying the plant as one of the nation's 10 worst. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>'s environmental group, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, has also called it one of the worst-managed commercial facilities

<HEAD>Peru Attack Reveals Weakness in Halting Rebel Insurgency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is losing its battle against leftist insurgents, newspapers and magazines said Tuesday, one week after guerrillas wiped out a jungle police post, killing 13 and injuring 14 others. Last week, 24 policemen and 26 villagers died in other violence linked to the rebel group known as the Shining Path. Also on Tuesday, leftist <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> rebels exploded six bombs in downtown <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, wounding two pedestrians and causing minor damage. On Monday, Shining Path guerrillas killed 10 men and women in central <LOCATION> Huancavelica </LOCATION> state for selling food to soldiers. But less than a month ago, the government vowed to review its anti-insurgency policy, which media reports said is compromised by the country's economic crisis and mismanagement. In the police post attack, troops reached Uchiza only 12 hours after fighting began, even though Prime Minister <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON> was in touch by radio throughout and promised quick reinforcements, news reports said. <LOCATION> Uchiza </LOCATION>, located 245 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, is an hour's flight from <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and five minutes by helicopter from a police base in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>. Officials said soldiers could not reach the town earlier because bad weather prohibited flights, and travel by land was ruled out for fear of mines. `` The explanations have not been satisfactory. They are open to further questioning,'' said <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Comercio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper, in an editorial. Political infighting and poor coordination among police, military and the government have crippled the fight against insurgents, the newspaper said. `` Police have once again paid with blood for the incapacity of this government to confront terrorism,'' according to the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> magazine, <PERSON> Oiga </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caretas </PERSON>, another magazine, said the attack highlighted the insurgency's superiority in manpower and weapons. The government is strapped by <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s worst economic crisis this century. Inflation is expected to reach 10,000 percent this year. Rumors of military coups have surfaced repeatedly in the past six months. More than 14,000 deaths and $ 10 billion in damage have been attributed to the Shining Path guerrillas since 1980, when the rebels turned from propaganda to violence in their fight for a Marxist state. Uchiza is situated in the heart of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s cocaine-producing jungle, where rebels protect drug runners in exchange for weapons and money.

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> finds it hard to stay calm when he slips and slides along a rocky beach, pointing at animals dead and dying in a layer of crude oil spilled from the Exxon Valdez. He pointed to the skeleton of a recently dead otter on the beach, its bones picked clean. `` Here's an example of why we have to get dead animals and birds out of here,'' <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said. `` The eagles eat them. They ingest the oil in the fur, and they will eventually die, too.'' Acrid fumes from the black crude filled nostrils and watered eyes as Lawn, district chief of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, and his party of two jumped from a helicopter. Oil, so black it seemed to suck light, smothered the mossy rocks, an inch thick in places. `` Welcome to refinery beach,'' said state official <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fineberg </PERSON>. The North Slope Crude, once bound for West coast refineries, went on for miles, up and down the east shoreline of this once lush and wild island. It's a tiny stretch of an estimated 800 miles of shoreline hit with oil after the tanker hit a reef near <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> to the northeast. `` Look there,'' said Lawn, pointing just off-shore at something splashing feebly. `` That's an otter. He's just out there in black oil. Oil's just black. That otter will die soon.'' <PERSON> Fineberg </PERSON> worried about the brown and black bears in the spruce-covered mountains rearing from the beach. How will they fish or find other food when they leave their winter dens? They will die, <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said. `` That spash. That's a seal,'' he said, pointing just offshore at the velvety blanket of oil undulating on the water. `` That seal is going to die,'' <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said. `` That thing floating next to it is already dead. It's probably an otter.'' Down the beach, Lawn spotted something else snorting and diving. `` That sea lion is swimming in black oil. There's no clean water out there for him to swim in. That sea lion, in a few days, will be dead,'' he said. `` There's no clean water. Where's he going to go?'' Up ahead, gulls, some partly oiled, sat on tall black rocks. `` They're trying to stay out of the water,'' <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said. They do n't have to dive for a living like some ducks and seabirds Lawn gets very mad when he thinks about people who fly over the island and think the devastation is not severe because they ca n't see the dead, oil-covered animals `` The problem is you ca n't see them,'' <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said. `` They're so damn black that unless they move you just ca n't see them. You almost step on them. They crawl into little crevasses to get away from this terrible thing, whatever it is. They do n't know what this stuff is.''

<TEXT>
 A court on Tuesday convicted an activist for distributing leaflets and sentenced him to four months in prison Tuesday, and an appeals court upheld sentences for seven others in a crackdown on dissent. The court in the central city of <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION> convicted <PERSON> Jarolsav </PERSON> <PERSON> Popelka </PERSON> of disturbing public order, said dissident sources in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Popelka </PERSON>, 32, was arrested March 24. He had handed out flyers last year calling for the resignation of a hard-line communist leader and for genuine reforms and environmental protection. Also on Tuesday, Judge <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Roit </PERSON> upheld convictions against <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrova </PERSON>, a 22-year-old peace activist, and <PERSON> Ota </PERSON> <PERSON> Veverka </PERSON>, 32, stemming from banned protests in January, said Charter 77 activist <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabatova </PERSON>. On Feb. 22, Ms. <PERSON> Petrova </PERSON> was sentenced to nine months in prison and <PERSON> Sabatova </PERSON> received 12 months in prison. Ms. <PERSON> Petrova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Veverka </PERSON> were among dissidents who tried to lay flowers Jan. 16 in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in memory of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, a student who burned himself alive 20 years earlier to protest the presence of Soviet troops in his homeland following the 1968 invasion that crushed communist-led reforms. The appeal hearing also left unchanged suspended sentences for five other activists, Charter 77 signatories <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternova </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemec </PERSON>, <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Placak </PERSON> of the youth group Czech Children, <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Penc </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lennon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and Charter 77 spokesman <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Vondra </PERSON>. They had received suspended sentences ranging between two and six months at the Feb. 22 trial. More than 50 supporters applauded and cheered the defendants at <ORGANIZATION> Prague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and chanted `` We are with you!'' when the seven were escorted out, said sources speaking on condition of anonymity. Security was reported tight in the area and police checked identities of those entering the court. In <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION>, the trial of Charter 77 activist <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hradilek </PERSON> began Tuesday, Ms. <PERSON> Sabatova </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hradilek </PERSON>, one of this year's Charter spokesmen, has been charged with inciting others to rebellion through mass media and slandering the country abroad. He could face a jail term of up to five years. Officials postponed a third trial scheduled for Tuesday against two activists who protested police brutality used to disperse the crowds in January, said activists and emigre sources contacted in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vlasta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chramostova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Libusa </PERSON> <PERSON> Silhanova </PERSON>, both Charter 77 signatories, face up to one year in jail for a letter they wrote protesting the police break-up of the banned rallies. No new date was set for their trial, the sources said. The police violence in January also drew criticism from thousands of establishment intellectuals who signed at least three different petitions to the government protesting the police actions and the detention of prominent dissidents including banned playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was sentenced to nine months in prison in February in connection with the January demonstrations. His sentence was reduced by one month by an appeals court March 21.

 A glittering collection of gold jewelry and ornaments from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where gold was shunned in ancient times as an evil spirit, begins a three-year, nine-city tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s National Museum of African Art The handiwork of goldsmiths from <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> comes from the private Barbier-Mueller Museum of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, which houses one of the finest collections of African gold sculpture in the world. More than 150 handmade objects, comprising about half of the Barbier-Mueller collection, are going on display at the <LOCATION> Smithsonian </LOCATION>. They include elaborate necklaces, rings, hair jewels, pendants, masks, earrings, beads and ceremonial regalia such as gold-decorated fly whisks, sword handles and staffs. Guest curator <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrard </PERSON>, a British historian and authority on the gold trade in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said gold dust and nuggets long were regarded with fear by natives who believed they would cause blindness and insanity. Africans began their goldsmith traditions in the 5th century, when European traders, alerted by slave merchants, sailed down the west coast of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or crossed the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> in caravans from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to trade salt and spices for gold. Very little of ancient West African gold jewelry exists today because it was lost in trade, looted from burial grounds and melted down to make coins or new ornaments. <PERSON> Garrard </PERSON> said the oldest piece in the Smithsonian show probably is a fish pendant in pure gold _ about 22 carats _ from 18th century <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>. After the show closes at the National Museum of African Art on Aug. 28, it is scheduled to travel through July 1992 to art museums in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky.

 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bicouvaris </PERSON>, a Greek immigrant who survived her country's Nazi occupation and brought her perspective to high school classes in American government, was named National Teacher of the Year on Tuesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Bicouvaris </PERSON>, the 38th recipient of the award, was not even a citizen when she began teaching in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in 1963. But she became one five years later and `` developed a love for democracy that has become her teaching trademark,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bicouvaris </PERSON>, 49, said her formula for teaching government and international relations combines `` respect for my job, love for the children that I teach, and a very sincere commitment to make a difference.'' She is a teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION>. Known to her students as Mrs. <PERSON> Bic </PERSON>, she founded and directs an award-winning <ORGANIZATION> Model </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> program at her school and organized a schoolwide celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Constitution. Her teaching ideas on the Constitution were turned into a booklet circulated among educators nationwide. Asked if her students take citizenship seriously, Mrs. <PERSON> Bicouvaris </PERSON> said no teen-ager in any country does so. `` Our kids, they may not wave the flag. But they love this country. ... I find our kids very protective and very loving. I do n't worry about it,'' she said. But she added that `` I tell my students that I will haunt you if the day comes that it is time to vote and you do n't vote.'' In response to questions, Mrs. <PERSON> Bicouvaris </PERSON> offered advice to everyone from parents and students to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. For parents, particularly of young children, she urged them to provide a quiet place, books, love and talk, and get heavily involved in their children's schooling. `` Take the task very seriously,'' she said. `` It's like having a prize horse and developing -LRB- it -RRB- for that big race.'' For students, she said, simply `` showing up at the door of the schoolhouse'' is not enough. She also urged students to make school rather than jobs their priority during high school. `` Many students work nowadays. ... They are very busy people,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bicouvaris </PERSON> said. `` What I find deplorable many times is they work school into the business schedule rather than fit business into the school schedule.'' For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, scheduled to present her with a crystal apple on Wednesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Bicouvaris </PERSON> said she would ask him to follow up his pledges to be an education president with `` the action needed to make education truly a priority. ... I would like him to put the emphasis on education as an investment and not as an expense.'' The National Teacher of the Year award is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Encyclopaedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Britannica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and Good Housekeeping magazine. Mrs. <PERSON> Bicouvaris </PERSON> was selected over three other finalists from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. She will spend the next year speaking to civic groups and other organizations around the country. When Mrs. <PERSON> Bicouvaris </PERSON> was 5, her father was killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> occupying <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Her uncle was rounded up with 39 other people and shot to death in retaliation for the death of a German. She came here at 20 and secured her first teaching job in her husband's home state of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> when the <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> school system waived a rule that all teachers must be American citizens. She became a citizen in 1968. Mrs. <PERSON> Bicouvaris </PERSON> said in a recent interview that surviving oppression in her Greek homeland has given her a perspective on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government that most teachers do n't have. `` I have been fortunate to have been in two worlds,'' she said. `` I have seen how things have been when there is war, when there is oppression. It has given me a further appreciation, I believe, for freedom. It has given me a further appreciation for opportunity for all.''

 Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> on Tuesday said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s efforts on Central American peace are welcome after the `` lip service'' of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, and should be an example for the Cubans and Soviets. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who met separately with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, endorsed the administration's plan for non-lethal aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, a plan developed with bipartisan support from congressional leaders. `` Now people here can talk with one single voice,'' he said, in contrast to years of division among members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. As for the situation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> itself, he said he was concerned about the elections scheduled for February 1990 and said steps assuring fairness must be taken, including giving all parties access to television and other mass media. Asked whether the nearly $ 50 million in non-military aid recommended for the Contras would not undermine the Central American presidents' proposal to disband the rebel army, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> told reporters, `` These people need some support.'' He said disbanding of the Contras and returning them to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> must occur simultaneously with democratic reforms by the Sandinista government. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision not to revive military aid to the Contras should spur reciprocal action by the Cubans and Soviets in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, added the Costa Rican, who won the Nobel peace prize for his efforts in bringing the five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents to a regional accord in 1987. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said he told Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> that in view of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s emphasis on non-military Contra aid, `` It was time for him ... if he supports our peace plan ... to stop supporting the guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> also urged action by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who is currently on a visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` If he supports sincerely the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan he has to ... persuade <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> not to keep the support of the guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. War has taught us in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that violence is not the solution. We have learned that we must change bullets by ballots and we can only do this with the support of the Cubans and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accused the Soviets, through their aid to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, of supporting the leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> where the government is backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also estimate that the Soviets provide $ 1 billion a year, half in military aid and half in economic assistance, to the Nicaraguan government opposed by the U.S.-backed Contras. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday that reported remarks by Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> about Soviet opposition to `` export of revolution'' were very encouraging in terms of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Those comments `` could be very significant if they mean the reduction of Soviet military support in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or if they mean that Soviet surrogates would cease supporting'' guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. In his Oval Office meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> spoke of a need to have the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other democracies scrutinize the election rules set up by the Nicaraguan government as well as next February's election itself, an administration source said. Later, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> told reporters in a photo session with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that the Nicaraguans must allow establishment of an independent television station, with access by opposition parties, as part of the proof that its elections will be free and fair. The Central American presidents had agreed that `` there should be equal opportunity and equal access to all mass media by all political parties. Otherwise it will be very difficult to talk about free elections,'' he said. He also said time must be allowed for such things as voter registration and fair campaigning. Comparing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said, `` I breathe a new atmosphere, a new environment, because I have no doubts Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is going to sincerely support the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> accord, the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> plan'' for Central American peace. `` This is something that in the past that I got some lip service when people mentioned they were happy with our efforts to democratize and bring peace to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the neogtiating table,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` I think that now they are quite sincere and they are doing what they are doing in good faith.'' He said he had discussed with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his concerns about making sure the Nicaraguan elections are fair. `` I am really worried as a Costa Rican about the organization of the next elections,'' he said, though he also said he has no reason to doubt the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> commitment to fulfilling their promises. He noted arguments about whether the Contras should lay down their arms following democratization moves by the Sandinistas, or whether they should be dismantled as a fighting force first. `` I think this should be simultaneous,'' he said. `` With repatriation there should be a democratic climate in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or there is no reason for them to go back.''

<HEAD>Beef Shortage is Danger Sign for Brazil's Anti-Inflation Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When beef began to disappear from supermarkets last month and butchers took to the streets against illegal price increases, many Brazilians had a sinking feeling of deja vu. Three years ago, powerful cattle ranchers defied a nationwide price freeze aimed at halting runaway 1,000 percent inflation. The shortages and black marketeering that followed doomed the government's plan. Now it seemed to be happening again. The beef crisis alarmed the government. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> called the shortage sabotage and said it threatened the fledgling democracy under which <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on Nov. 15 will hold its first presidential election in 29 years. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will not tolerate `` speculation, fraudulent withholding of goods -LRB- and -RRB- crimes against the economy,'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said last week in a weekly nationwide radio program. `` Politicking and economic disorganization threaten the transition to democracy,'' said <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, a civilian who took office in 1985 after 21 years of military rule. Inflation reached 28.8 percent a month in December, then fell to 3 percent for 11 days in February after the government froze prices. But the cost of living rose 6 percent in March, far above government predictions. Problems began soon after <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> on Jan. 15 announced a national wage-and-price freeze as part of his `` Summer Plan,'' <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s fourth anti-inflation program in three years Shortages soon began to occur. Eggs, auto parts and cooking oil became scarce as suppliers said they could n't meet demand at the government-set price. The government acted swiftly, negotiating a tax break for auto industries and seizing 3.8 million cans of oil in a supermarket warehouse. Federal police even detained the supermarket's owner, <PERSON> Abilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Diniz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Pao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acucar </ORGANIZATION> chain and one of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s wealthiest businessmen, on charges of `` crimes against the public economy. But the government was impotent against cattlemen, for centuries a powerful and independent clan in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest country. Cattle breeders raised the price of beef to wholesalers from $ 18 for each 32-pound unit in January to $ 23 in March. But wholesalers who tried to pass on the higher costs were fined by federal price-checkers and many simply stopped sales altogether. In many cities, butcher shops sold meat on the black market or closed their doors. Supermarkets rationed beef to customers. Butchers in cars and ox-carts marched through downtown <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s biggest city and financial center, to protest the price increases. Riot troops broke up the march with water jets colored with pink dye. The government vowed not to repeat the mistakes of 1986, when federal police on horseback and in helicopters tried to find cattle allegedly hidden in pastures. Police caught only a few cows for slaughter, and the government was ridiculed. This time, officials threatened to ban beef exports and audit the tax returns of price violators. But the ranchers did n't budge. In April, the government agreed to discuss a price increase for meat to save its anti-inflation program. Politics and inflation are closely linked in this country of 144 million. Past failed attempts to halt inflation caused the popularity of <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s center-right government to plummet and helped leftist parties to sharp gains in November municipal elections.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Couple In Adoption Case Gripping Italy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The law prevailed over the heart Tuesday as a family court refused to return a 3-year-old Filipino girl to the Italian couple who illegally adopted her. The case of <PERSON> Serena </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> has gripped <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for weeks, provoking newspaper editorials, petition drives and even a hunger strike. The tearful parents, <PERSON> Rosanna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Giubergia </PERSON>, announced they will appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, to get the child back. The case focused attention on <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s adoption system and the reasons that have led hundreds of Italian families to look abroad to adopt children. `` The family violated the codes of the law but not those of the heart,'' said an editorial in <LOCATION> Il </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Popolo </LOCATION>, newspaper of the dominant <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Serena </PERSON> was brought to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Phillipines </LOCATION> by the <PERSON> Giubergia </PERSON> family in January 1987 and taken away from them by a judge last month. The couple, from <LOCATION> Racconigi </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, admitted they lied in the adoption procedure to skirt the red tape. <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Giubergia </PERSON>, 36, head of shipping for the state railway in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, had gone to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and declared that he fathered the child. The couple legally adopted a Filipino boy in 1985 after Mrs. <PERSON> Giuberia </PERSON>, 34, was advised by her doctors not to have children. A judge ruled they could no longer have custody of <PERSON> Serena </PERSON> on grounds it would only encourage illegal adoptions, and placed the child in an orphanage March 16. In Tuesday's ruling, the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> said the child had not suffered psychological damage from the three-week separation and therefore will be placed with a new, legal family. Residents of <LOCATION> Racconigi </LOCATION>, 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, have formed a `` <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Serena </PERSON>'' and gathered 70,000 signatures on a petition urging President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> to intervene. <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> asked Justice Minister <PERSON> Giuliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassalli </PERSON> to look into the case. <PERSON> Vassalli </PERSON> then met with the family but said the court had the right to decide. According to a report released last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, requests for adoption of foreign children in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> have increased as much as 1,000 percent between 1984 and 1987. The report, entitled `` A House for Every Child: 1984-1987,'' said that about three-quarters of the foreign adoptions in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> are not done through official procedures and are legalized only after the child has been brought to the country.

<HEAD>Ex-Official Says He Took Money from Defense Consultants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement official said Tuesday that he took thousands of dollars from defense consultants in return for providing inside information that would help private companies get military contracts. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, who headed an aviation systems branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement command, made the admission at the trial of three <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> executives accused of conspiring to bribe him to influence the award of an equipment contract. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> testified that he had received at least $ 2,000 in cash from a defense consultant in return for providing detailed information about an equipment contract <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> was seeking from the Pentagon. On cross-examination, defense attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuohey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said: `` You've been selling your country short for money for 10 years?'' `` I have taken money for 10 years,'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said, acknowledging receipt of thousands of dollars in payments that <PERSON> Tuohey </PERSON> listed. On direct testimony, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> told jurors that he received two $ 1,000 cash payments, and possibly a third, from consultant <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> after providing detailed status reports about the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to buy hand-held radar test devices. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, who pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and bribery last month, said he fed information to <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> during monthly meetings they had from mid-1985 to June 1988. `` Everything I knew or could find out about the procurement was passed on to Mr. <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>,'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said. He testified that <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> told him that he was relaying the information to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, a defense consultant retained by <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, who has also pleaded guilty, testified later in the day that he received only sporadic reports from <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and got no information at all during 1986. `` He was passing this on to Mr. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, who was in turn passing this on to <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>,'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said. He testified that he had expected to receive about $ 25,000, a one-fourth share of the $ 100,000 that <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> was to be paid by <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> for his services. But <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> testified that he and <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and another co-conspirator agreed to tell <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> they were sharing $ 100,000 instead of $ 150,000, the amount they expected to receive from <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>, adding: `` Everyone felt he really did n't do anything to aid the procurement.'' <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> also pleaded guilty in the case and may testify as a prosecution witness against the three defendants: <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON>; <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON>. The defense contends that the three <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> executives knew nothing about the illegal activities of <LOCATION> Parkin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaides </PERSON>, the company's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist, who has also pleaded guilty in the case. Earlier in the day, however, former <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> testified that he had attended a meeting during which <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> agreed to hire <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and pay him $ 150,000 if <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> obtained the contracts. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> conceded on cross-examination that he did not know whether the agreement with <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> he helped draft was ever executed. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said he had hired <PERSON> Savaides </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s recommendation. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> had repeatedly over 15 years offered to go into business with him, proposing arrangements to provide inside information to defense contractors for a price. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said he spurned those offers until mid-1985, when <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> proposed a deal involving <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>. `` I told him yes, that I could help him.'' During a subsequent meeting <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> said that `` he did have a contact who would work with <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> and it looked like this could be profitable for all of us,'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> added. `` He told me that it was <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> had a relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> and could easily get a contract with <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> added that <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> said that `` he needed quantity and budget information'' that would enable <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> to know the scope of the potential contract. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said he was supposed to `` keep him posted on what was happening in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> _ a daily status report.'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> explained to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jurors that much of the information he passed to <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> was not supposed to be released to the defense industry because `` it could possibly give one competitor an unfair advantage over another.'' By the spring of 1987, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said that <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> complained that `` he was having difficulty getting paid from <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>.'' The former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement official said that he suggested several ways of pressuring <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>, including raising the possibility that the contract would be terminated or that the full three-year term of the order would not be completed. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said that <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> told him `` he was going to threaten them with termination of the existing contract and use any leverage he could'' to get paid. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said that, six months later, <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> reported that he was to share a quarter of the $ 100,000 that <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to pay.

It does n't look as much that way now,'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said `` <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> lost it fair and square,'' although he said he was `` sorry to admit'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> had the better site. `` Our limited analysis provided us no reason to question the decision to site the super collider in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said in testimony that will be given Wednesday at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearing on the site selection process. `` We found that the task force evaluated and rated the proposed sites in accordance with the technical and cost criteria, and provided evidence to support its ratings,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, who was briefed by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, said the study resolves his concerns about the selection process and he is now ready to support the particle accelerator in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where it faces an uncertain future as the DOE seeks approval and money to begin construction. `` Had it been a political decision, I would have washed my hands of support,'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, however, said it had unresolved technical questions about tunneling in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> for the 53-mile underground ring, the theory used to evaluate the electrical power subcriterion, and the impact of caves in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> on that proposed site. `` <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s verdict is no surprise to those of us who have been heavily involved in pushing the project forward in recent years. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> won the super collider for the best of reasons: hard work and technical merit,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said he would support funding the project on a `` limited basis'' because money is tight and he does n't want to see other science projects, especially in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, cut to pay for the collider. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development, which will decide the collider's funding The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is seeking $ 250 million for the collider, including $ 160 million for initial construction, in next year's budget. This is the third year the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to authorize construction. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated $ 100 million although the president had requested $ 363 million to begin initial construction, pushing back the targeted date of completion. The project is now targeted to be built by 1998, instead of the original 1996 completion, said DOE spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON>.

 Voters in one out of every eight Soviet parliamentary districts refused to elect anyone even though they had a choice of only one or two candidates, according to official results released Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency released the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s final tally of the votes from March 26 elections for the country's new 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that in 195 of the 1,500 geographical districts across the country, no one got a majority of the vote even though there were only one or two candidates. In those districts, new electoral campaigns will be waged and a second election will be held May 14, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Election results released earlier showed that in the first nationwide multicandidate election in 70 years voters rejected many top-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government leaders. They included <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>, a candidate member of the ruling Politburo, who ran unopposed in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a meeting of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party leaders Tuesday, led by <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>, characterized the election results as a `` serious political lesson.'' `` <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> residents are not satisfied with the tempo of solving the housing problem, the equipping of the city, the ecological situation,'' the agency said. `` They express dissatisfaction with the shortage of industrial and food products and concern about the growth of crime,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Among those who also suffered defeat were the <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> party leader and mayor, the mayor and second-leading party official in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and a host of regional party chiefs. `` In the majority of cases, the reason for this is the striving of the people to quicken the process of restructuring, more actively struggle with bureaucracy and command-administrative methods of work,'' election commission Chairman <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief who waged an anti-establishment campaign, won his race with more than 89 percent of the vote. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also indicated that party officials met in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> on Tuesday to review the results of the election, but no word was available on the results of that meeting. The literary weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> reported that in at least one case a party leader's loss may result in a court case. The paper said the party leader of <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, was taking his opponent to court for distributing 100,000 leaflets accusing him of selling deficit items like meat, perfume and sugar at his election rallies. V.I. <PERSON> Romanov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION> party leader, lost the election to <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Safonov </PERSON>, the director of a home-building enterprise. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said two days after the balloting that party organizations would have to review the status of top officials who lost their races. He refused to characterize the vote as a defeat for the party, saying the vast majority of those elected were party members. Official figures released Tuesday indicated that 87.6 percent of those elected on March 26 were party members. <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that nationwide voter turnout was 89.8 percent. `` That high degree of activity gladdens us more than the notorious 99.9 percent participation which we were proud of earlier,'' <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> said. `` In this election there was no race for percentage of participation, the previous mandatory measures practiced previously were fully excluded.'' In the past, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> proclaimed an almost total participation in elections as proof of citizens' satisfaction, even though voters were n't offered a choice. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said runoff elections will be held in another 76 districts Sunday for seats in which the vote was split among three or more candidates such that no one received a majority. One-third of the new congress will consist of deputies elected by the party and its affiliates, labor, professional and social organizations. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 18 of those 750 seats remain to be filled. They include 12 seats from the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, where scientists rejected most of an old guard list that did not include human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has been nominated again as a candidate and the academy is to decide later this week when a new election will be held. The final figures indicated that of those elected, 17.1 percent were women and 18.6 percent were workers. Both figures were lower than the composition of the present Supreme Soviet, in which authorities have tried to impose quotas.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised Tuesday to make active use of his veto powers and suggested a minimum wage bill now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may be the first candidate. `` Let the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not misunderstand my determination,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a business group. He insisted he would not budge from his proposal for raising the current $ 3.35 hourly minimum wage to $ 4.25, with a 60-day sub-minimum `` training wage'' for youths. `` I've got to hold the line. I've got to hold the line on the grounds of economics -LRB- and -RRB- on the grounds of making people understand I was serious about that being the best offer,'' he said during a question-and-answer session with members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has passed legislation to raise the minimum wage to $ 4.55 by October 1991, with a sub-minimum wage starting at $ 3.35 to be paid for 60 days but only for a person's first-ever job. A pending <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would raise the minimum wage to $ 4.65 in January 1992, and currently has no sub-minimum provision. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s measure would raise the minimum wage to $ 4.25 by January 1992. `` This is our best shot,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I respect and recognize the positions of ... members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on it. But I've got to stay with this and I'm going to stay with this.'' The president said he would not shy away from using the veto. `` There will be time when we have to say, look here's what I believe, and then rally our -LRB- one -RRB- third to defend the president's position. It takes a two-thirds vote of both chambers to override a veto. On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ who vowed `` no new taxes'' both during his campaign and as president _ was asked if he could support a value-added tax on products and services, something like a national sales tax. `` I do n't even want to discuss a tax on consumerism,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. However, he said that given the hypothetical requirement to choose between different kinds of taxes, a tax on consumption would be philosophically preferable to one that would sap job creation. Meanwhile, press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had set up a new White House Council on business competitiveness and assigned Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to head it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had promised to do so in his Feb. 9 budget speech to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Members of the council will include Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chairman of the President's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> already is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an Eisenhower-era body <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has reconstructed to explore and promote the nation's space program. As part of its mission to improve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business competitiveness, the new council will examine, among other things, government regulation and paperwork burdens, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said, however, that it would `` not be a decision-making body'' and the panel would instead focus on `` the larger questions that bear on competitiveness.'' `` They will determine their own duration and the nature of their work,'' the spokesman said, `` so the vice president will give form and substance to this group.''

 A group of students took over the <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> administration building on Tuesday in a protest over conditions in classrooms, dormitories and the cafeteria. Hundreds of other students demonstrated outside, while city police and campus security guards stood nearby. No arrests were made, and no confrontations were reported. `` This is not an irrational temper tantrum,'' said <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> freshman from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who was among the leaders of the demonstration. `` We have filled out the papers. We have gone through the process. The process has failed.'' It was unclear how many students were in the building. Protest organizers refused to say how many were involved in the siege, and the curtains were drawn over the windows. Occasionally, hands could be seen placing signs in the windows. One poster had a drawing of a clenched fist and the words: `` Student Power.'' Students who gathered on a lawn at the campus south of downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> heard a taped message outlining a series of grievances against the administration of the predominantly <PERSON> black </PERSON> college. The students cheered as the unidentified speaker on the tape criticized the college's security system, cafeteria, health services, dormitory conditions and what students feel is a lack of black studies in the curriculum. Protesters also said the college was planning to expel about 150 students who were delinquent on tuition payments. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the college, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said administrators wanted to talk with the students who took over the building. College President <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was out of town. Students also were angry that the school had refused to compensate students for clothing and other possessions lost in a blaze at a men's dormitory on Sunday. Ms. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said officials were looking into the complaints.

<HEAD>Beirut Bombarded For Fourth Day; Americans Evacuated</HEAD>

 Syrian and Christian gunners traded shellfire across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> before dawn Tuesday, bombarding the city's residential suburbs non-stop for the fourth day A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official said two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officers were evacuated Monday. The officers were part of a three-man technical team assigned to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> told reporters after a meeting with army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> that, `` This fighting must stop quickly. ... It has caused tremendous damage, killed many people and brought <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s economy to its knees.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> met <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> at the bunker of the battered presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, five miles east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military Cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government. His 20,000 mostly Christian troops have been fighting an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces in and around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for the past four weeks. Police said overnight clashes killed six people and wounded 18 in Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> areas before shelling dwindled to sporadic exchanges after daybreak. The shelling began Saturday. Two more civilians were killed and seven wounded when the shelling intensified in the afteroon, said a police spokesman who can not be identified under standing rules. The latest casualties raised the toll to 155 people killed and 506 wounded since March 8, when the current round of hostilities broke out between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian troops and the Syrian and Druse Moslem fighters. Also Tuesday, Syrian soldiers allowed a convoy of four tanker trucks to cross from north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into the Christian hinterland northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to provide a power station with fuel oil. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawlawi </PERSON>, manager of the state oil refinery in the northern town of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, said the tankers would bring 1,000 tons of fuel oil for the station over the next four days. `` A total power failure would be disastrous to the whole of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mawlawi </PERSON> said in a broadcast on the Moslem Voice of the Nation radio. Supplies were allowed in after the electricity authority warned its power station in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Zouk </PERSON> suburb would run out of fuel oil Saturday, triggering a power failure across most of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army gunners Monday set ablaze a Syrian army ammunition depot in the mountain resort of <LOCATION> Abadieh </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It said the depot `` contained lethal chemical materials which forced the Syrian army to evacuate civilians from the <LOCATION> Abadiyeh </LOCATION> area.'' The report could not be verified. Despite the relative lull that prevailed over <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the surrounding mountains from 5 a.m., civilians remained huddled in basements and bomb shelters to avoid any sudden escalation of hostilities. A dozen families sheltering in an apartment building basement in the <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Adonis </LOCATION> district dispatched one man to a nearby bakery. `` This is the safest way. We will send one of us to buy food for the whole building every day until a cease-fire is declared and accepted by both sides,'' <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Shedyak </PERSON>, a mechanical engineer, said by telephone. Kuwaiti Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, head of a six-man <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mediation committee, was due in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Tuesday to try to arrange a settlement of the confrontation. The leftist daily paper As-Safir, which reflects official Syrian views, said <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> would propose a two-month truce between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and his opponents to give the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee time to work out a solution to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s six-month-old political crisis. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has been insisting that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> be a party to any cease-fire accord with his 20,000 troops. The Syrians, with 40,000 troops in predominantly Moslem terrritories of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate, are the main power brokers in the country. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing in their mandate by siding with the Moslems against the Christians in the 14-year-old civil war. Officially, the Syrians deny their troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are involved against <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces entrenched in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The political crisis erupted Sept. 22 when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s 6-year term expired with parliament failing to elect a successor. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> like himself, head of an interim military cabinet to rule pending the election of a new president. Syrian-backed Moslems rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment because it violated a 45-year-old tradition of having a Sunni Moslem premier, a Christian president and a Shiite Moslem parliament speaker. They pledged allegiance to Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni who governed under <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Senate Panel's S&amp;L Proposal Wins Praise, Criticism from Adminstration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior administration official on Tuesday praised the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s savings and loan proposal for maintaining tough capital standards, but criticized it for creating a loophole in the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. The committee is meeting behind closed doors this week in preparation for public bill-writing sessions next week. On Tuesday, the panel began going over a series of changes to the administration plan proposed by the staff of the committee chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich. According to a committee document obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan would deviate only slightly from the administration's requirement that thrift owners invest more of their own money, or capital, to back up the loans they make. The administration would prevent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls from expanding after June 1991 if they do not meet stricter capital standards. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal keeps the deadline, which <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L lobbyists have been trying to push back, but would permit some weak S & amp; Ls to grow modestly even if they missed it. `` We would applaud the fact that ... they have resisted watering down the capital standards,'' Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, one of the key architects of the administration's proposal, said in a telephone interview Of the proposed capital changes, he said, `` I do n't see anything that's grossly out of line.'' However, he warned that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal for raising $ 50 billion to close or sell failed <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls `` fundamentally threatens the Gramm-Rudman process'' by setting a precedent that could be used again for other spending programs. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has put togther a complex mechanism that combines taxpayer and industry funds and keeps the $ 50 billion out of the budget deficit by selling bonds through a quasi-government agency. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> advocates including the spending in the budget deficit and raising the money through the sale of regular <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, a method he says would save $ 4.5 billion over 30 years because <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds carry a lower interest rate. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> would avoid Gramm-Rudman's automatic spending cuts by raising all of the money in the current fiscal year, now that the deficit target deadlines have passed. The administration believes its scheme for evading Gramm-Rudman ca n't be readily applied to other kinds of programs, while the <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> plan could be used every year to avoid deficit limits. <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> also warned that opposition to <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s proposal from Gramm-Rudman advocates could delay passage of the entire S & amp; L package. Groups representing commercial banks are particularly happy with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> amendments that would shift more power over S & amp; Ls to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a commercial bank regulator. The administration wants to give the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> control over the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposit insurance fund. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan would expand the agency's power further by giving it control over accounting and <ORGANIZATION> capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls and by making it the primary regulator of state-chartered S & amp; Ls That would leave the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulator, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, with little power. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yingling </PERSON>, executive director of government relations for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said expanding the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s control over <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls would ensure that S & amp; L standards did not become looser than bank standards. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said he was pleased by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> change that would give the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> chairman a set term. The administration wants the president to have the power to dismiss the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> chairman at will. `` We think Sen. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> has moved very much in the right direction in terms of making the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> board considerly more independent of the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. We think that's a major plus,'' <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> said.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer testified Tuesday he took much of what <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> said with `` with four grains of salt'' and recalled making a Pinocchio-like nose-growing gesture whe he read a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was drafting. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> said he felt that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, in his efforts to help the Nicaraguan Contras, had crossed `` the line from objectivity to advocacy.'' Although he was called as a defense witness, <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON>'s testimony was peppered with critical references to <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who is on trial on charges including withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the Iran-Contra affair <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> jousted with prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> who tried in cross examination to cast doubt on the witness' credibility, suggesting more than once that he had lied. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked whether <PERSON> North </PERSON>, formerly a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel attached to the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>, had been considered trustworthy. `` I had considered Colonel North a trustworthy person but there were occasions when myself and others had some questions about the veracity about some of the things he told us,'' <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked whether he remembered testifying before a grand jury that he took things <PERSON> North </PERSON> said with four grains of salt. `` Maybe three,'' said <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> then read what the witness had told the grand jury: `` With Colonel North you never could be certain if what he was telling was true or fantasy or deliberately meant to mislead. My practice was to take everything with four grains of salt.'' To that reading, <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> responded: `` It was the way I came to feel about him in the summer of 1986.'' <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> recalled a comment by a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official, `` that whatever <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> was doing he was bound to get us all in a lot of trouble and he wanted to stay far away from him.'' North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> drew from the witness that he admired <PERSON> North </PERSON> for `` his dedication and his persistence'' and would want him `` in a foxhole with me when the first rounds were coming in.'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked about a time when <PERSON> North </PERSON> was drafting answers to inquiries by two congressional committees. One of the charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> is that he made false statements in those letters, which were signed by then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. `` He showed you some of his answers?'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked. `` I asked him if they were accurate and they did not appear to be so,'' said <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON>. `` Did you do anything?'' said <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> balked, appealing to the judge on whether he had to answer. `` I want to know what you did,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> continued. `` I suggested ...'' <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> began, and the prosecutor put his hand to his nose and stretched his arm out, as if to show a long nose. `` Not that long,'' said <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON>, and even <PERSON> North </PERSON> at the witness table joined in the laughter. `` Whose nose grew?'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> asked. `` I was trying to convey to Colonel North his answer did not reflect the facts,'' said <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON>. `` He said it was out of the suggestion of Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and he was not a free agent in the matter.'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> testified earlier in the trial that he was responsible for the letters and that <PERSON> North </PERSON> contributed just two innocuous paragraphs to one of the letters. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> also brought out that <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> had made no mention in his 1987 grand jury appearance of his assertion Monday that then-CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had designated <PERSON> North </PERSON> as the man who would assist the Contras if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted a military aid ban. `` You know it's easy to blame things on a dead man,'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> told the witness. `` Yes,'' responded <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON>. Under questioning from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s comments were at a different meeting from the one he discussed before the grand jury. <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> said that at the time he was being `` intimidated'' by members of the special prosecuting team and that `` my agenda was to try to be cooperative ... but ... avoid going into significant detail when not asked.'' `` I did not lie to the grand jury,'' <PERSON> Cannistraro </PERSON> said at one point. In rapid succession, three more defense witnesses testified Tuesday afternoon before the jury was sent home until Thursday. The one-day recess was called because of a death in the family of a juror. _ <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official, testified that he had the job of drafting testimony that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was to give on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Nov. 21, 1986, after the diversion of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales profits to the Contras became known <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was in a Central American country, so the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> arranged for <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> to be flown in an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-130 to take him the draft, the witness said. He and an armed guard were alone with the crew on the plane, which can carry more than 42,000 pounds of cargo. _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON>, who owns a tax-preparation franchise, told of being detailed by <PERSON> North </PERSON> to help with getting the land for an air strip in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON> credited <PERSON> North </PERSON> with saving his life when both were <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> platoon leaders in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` I saw an opportunity to help this country,'' he said. `` To this day I think everything I did and everything <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> did was helpful to this country.'' _ <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>, who was assistant secretary of state for East Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in March 1986, said that at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION>'s request he got <PERSON> North </PERSON> together with representatives of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <PERSON> North </PERSON> told each about the Contras' needs and eventually <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> contributed $ 2 million.

<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> security adviser, said Tuesday that despite turmoil in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, that country's armed forces were strong and ready to fight. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> was installed as head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and said his job was to keep 1 million active, reserve and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ready for combat `` with the hope they will never be needed.'' `` The Soviets are going through wrenching historic change, beginning with the irreversible acknowledgement that their system is broken and has to be changed,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said at a ceremony at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McPherson </LOCATION>, the headquarters of the command, which is known as FORSCOM. Despite the Soviets' internal turmoil, `` there is nothing wrong with their deployed forces,'' he said. `` Their FORSCOM is strong. We must be strong.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said a priority was <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and reserve units, which `` are not as ready as we would like them to be. We do n't have the resources.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said he saw a role for the military in the war on drugs, but cautioned against its use as a police force. `` I will not be resistant to finding ways for the military to help civilian authorities in defense against a major threat,'' he said. `` I think there are opportunities for our men to get good training'' in interdiction. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> cautioned that even an apparently innovative leader like <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would need time to make major changes in Soviet life. `` It took them 70 years to acknowledge their system is not working. They're not going to fix it in one or two years,'' he said. `` It is the West that is strong. He has to be innovative. He has to be imaginative.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who will be 52 Wednesday, succeeded Gen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palastra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who had the post for three years and was retiring. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who served in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, became President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser in January 1987. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was in a higher state of readiness with a better quality of soldier than at any time in his 31 years of military service. In the old days, he said, soldiers would keep a pinball machine in a corner of their barracks. `` Today there's a computer there.''

 A suspected marijuana smuggler being chased by federal agents bailed out of his aircraft, prompting <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> to launch an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16 to shoot down the pilotless plane, officials said Tuesday. But the sophisticated military jet was n't needed when the twin-engine <PERSON> Beechcraft </PERSON> crashed into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> about 190 miles west of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> on Monday night, after five aircraft joined the chase. Footage of the plane slamming into the sea was filmed from a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chase plane. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Coxe </PERSON>, 42, a commercial pilot from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, set his <ORGANIZATION> Beechcraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travelair </ORGANIZATION> on automatic pilot and _ making his first jump _ parachuted over <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in south-central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petty </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. `` He said he almost took his head off. He was upside down and the cables were around his neck when he pulled the cord,'' <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. In custody later, <PERSON> Coxe </PERSON> said a companion he refused to identify had bailed out before him. `` We do n't know anything about a second person,'' said Customs spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blackhawk </ORGANIZATION> helicopter in pursuit of the Beechcraft saw <PERSON> Coxe </PERSON> swing a U-turn and bail out over land just north of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Josephine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. `` They saw a large object with a parachute leave the plane,'' he said, adding that agents were n't certain at first what went out the door at 7,500 feet. They landed and took <PERSON> Coxe </PERSON> into custody. <PERSON> Coxe </PERSON>, charged with smuggling marijuana by aircraft, was taken before a magistrate Tuesday and ordered held without bond pending another hearing Friday. A Coast Guard radar plane spotted a small plane flying suspiciously low at about 200 feet over the water 150 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on Monday afternoon, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. The helicopter and a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falcon </ORGANIZATION> jet took off after it. Three hours after the saga began, Customs contacted the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> requesting an F-16 to shoot down the unmanned aircraft. The F-16 from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> base tailed the Beechcraft and was ready to shoot it down had it veered back toward land and posed any danger to populated areas, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. j.g <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Katinski </PERSON>. The plane crashed after narrowly missing a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> air-surveillance balloon tethered to a ship in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, authorities said. A Coast Guard cutter sped to the crash site and fished more than 600 pounds of marijuana from the wreckage, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. `` We're asking for pretrial detention because this man is a danger to the community,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Linnea </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` This man parachuted from a plane over a populated area. The plane flew around and it was a bomb that easily could have landed anywhere.'' A passport seized from <PERSON> Coxe </PERSON> indicated he had left <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved an emergency anti-loitering bill Tuesday that would give the city's police power to arrest people congregating in designated `` illegal drug zones. The bill, the latest move in the city's attempt to curb drug-related violence, allows police to make arrests if those gathering in a such a zone refuse to move on when asked to do so. The mayor has 10 days in which to sign the measure, which then would be effective for 90 days. The police chief would be able to designate a place with a history of drug activity over six months as an illegal drug zone and to ban congregation in an area of 1,000 square feet for up to 120 hours. The areas, limited to public property such as sidewalks, streets, and public-housing courtyards, would be clearly marked by signs, barriers and police tape. The maximum penalty for loitering would be $ 300 or 90 days in jail. `` The intent of the bill is to be able to disperse people,'' said <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, a member of the council. `` We recognize that we will have to impede on the rights of others in order for us to gain control of our community,'' said H.R. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, another council member. He said he feared residents of neighborhoods where drug sales are rampant will be subject to arrest whnever they gather outdoors. `` These areas are non-air-conditioned public housing units. When it gets hot, of course, people are going to come outside,'' he said. Council Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> the measure only prohibits congregating if police have asked the people to move on.

 Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> on Tuesday denounced discrimination against prospective Asian-American college students and said his department is exploring allegations of admission bias at some schools. `` Our Office of Civil Rights has been examining these charges. We've been looking at them very closely,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee hearing. `` That kind of discrimination is ... reprehensible, it's illegal. We will investigate all complaints in these areas and follow up.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> also is doing compliance reviews based on press reports and information from other sources. `` OCR will undertake several compliance reviews this year just to look at this very issue. We do n't have to wait for a formal complaint,'' he said. He did not say which schools would be targeted. A spokesman later said reviews prompted by questions about discriination against Asian-Americans currently are in progress at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Concern over admission policies biased against Asian-Americans was raised by Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and human services and education. <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> cited a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> article that discussed problems at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> complaints against the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> auditor-general's report questioning <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> admission policies. He asked <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> whether his department would be interested in starting a compliance review at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. A Cavazos aide, deputy undersecretary <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>, told him it would be up to <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> to follow up. Later, <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> had received four individual complaints in the last two years about <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, one of which is still pending. He said no compliance review has been undertaken because the university is `` involved in a self-evaluation.'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> cited the auditor-general report as well as a recent faculty report noting Asians may be at a disadvantage in gaining admission to the school. `` We are waiting to see what sort of action they take'' in response to the reports, he said. Officials at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> acknowledge that the law school has kept separate waiting lists for Asians, blacks, Hispanics and native Americans for a dozen years. They say the multiple lists are a way for minorities to gain representation in the incoming class. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> told <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> that as a former college president, `` I know that it is important to have a diverse student body. I certainly favor greater opportunity for minority students. But discrimination against students merely because they are Asian-American is illegal and unacceptable.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should require 90 percent reductions in air pollution by nitrogen compounds, given off in power plant emissions and motor vehicle exhausts, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Nitrogen oxides help form ozone, acid rain and the formation of airborne particles that hamper visibility. Some of nitrogen oxide compounds also contribute to the global warming embodied in the `` greenhouse effect'' theory while others may be more damaging to health than previously believed, the association said. `` Aggressive control of -LRB- nitrogen oxides -RRB- is necessary, feasible and long overdue,'' said <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> of the association, which recommended reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by about 4 million metric tons a year, from about 20 million metric tons now. To do that would cost the economy about $ 3 per person per year, she said. Several technologies can reduce emissions; catalytic devices used in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are achieving 90 percent reductions. Nitrogen oxides, which result from any combustion, have long been recognized as important pollutants. In recent years, however, congressional attention has been largely focused on sulfur compounds, which also form acid rain; on <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> policies for dealing with the failure of many cities to meet ozone standards, and on emissions of industrial chemicals. About half of all nitrogen oxides come from industrial fuel combustion, mostly in power plants, while 40 percent come from motor vehicle exhausts, according to estimates by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. If nothing is done, power plant emissions are expected to double in 30 years and total emissions to increase by 50 percent, the association said. New power plants must meet strict emissions limits, with coal plants achieving a 65 percent reduction from what their emissions would otherwise be. There are no standards for plants built before 1971, however. The association said that new plants should be forced to reduce emissions by 90 percent and old plants should be required to install control equipment achieving 80 percent to 90 percent reductions over the next decade. Current federal standards for auto exhausts in all states but <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> result in about a 75 percent reduction in emissions from an uncontrolled car. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which has tougher standards of its own, is tightening its standards to achieve a 90 percent reduction by the 1991 model year. The association said that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in its debates this year on revising the Clean Air Act, should extend the new <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> auto standard to the rest of the country. Almost 100 cities fail to meet federal ozone standards, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, chief researcher for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s strategies for fighting ozone have lost effectiveness by neglecting nitrogen oxides. For sustained ozone formation, both nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbon vapors like unburned gasoline are necessary. In some areas, reductions in nitrogen oxides can increase ozone, so the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has stressed to states and cities that they should reduce hydrocarbon emissions. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> environmental engineer, said he believed the agency's concerns were converging with <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>'. `` If the numbers are high enough, there's no question he's right,'' <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> of the office said the agency was requiring states to consider nitrogen oxide reductions in revising their air pollution control plans. Speaking for himself and not the agency, <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON> said a requirement for a 90 percent emissions reduction in all cases would be `` technically premature.'' The agency's spokesman on air issues did not immediately return a phone call.

 Fire ant stings send at least 21,000 people a year to doctors in 13 Southern states, a survey has found. The survey of physicians for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Immunology also found that 413 people were treated for life-threatening reactions to fire ant stings last year and that 32 died, most of them because they were hypersensitive to the ant's poison In most of those who died, the ant stings triggered an anaphylactic or allergic response which caused the body's respiratory system to shut down `` People and physicians should take these stings seriously,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoades </PERSON>, a pediatrician at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>. People who are allergic to other kinds of insect stings should be especially cautious, said <PERSON> Rhoades </PERSON>, who heads a special panel that monitors medical problems caused by fire ants. Fire ants arrived in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by boat from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and have been slowly moving northward and westward. Cold weather has seemingly confined them to the Deep South. But recent studies have shown the ant is crossbreeding and that the hybrid, which can withstand lower temperatures, may push its range farther north into the north <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> mountains and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. More than 2,000 physicians in 13 states, or about 10 percent of those polled, responded to the allergy academy survey, indicating they treat about 21,000 patients a year for fire ant stings. Most of those stung were treated successfully with over-the-counter antihistamines.

<TEXT>
 The governments of the Greek and <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> communities have agreed to withdraw their soldiers from three tense observation points on the Green Line in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, president of the breakaway <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, confirmed in an interview that his government had fully agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan for the pullback. The agreement in principle marks the first time the Cypriot government and the administration of the <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> have ever concluded a military withdrawal agreement, said officials from both communities. Greek Cypriot troops are only 10 yards from Turkish Cypriot troops at some points in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. In 1988, a Turkish Cypriot and a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> were killed in separate sniping attacks across the Green Line, as the unofficial buffer zone dividing the two ethnic communities is known. Under the terms of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot forces will withdraw from the posts, but will not necessarily have to dismantle their defense works, said a Turkish Cypriot official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Cypriot Defense Minister <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Aloneftis </PERSON> said his government has agreed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan. Both sides still have to sign formal documents with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. If the plan succeeds, <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> said, it would `` naturally'' lead to further steps toward demilitarization, `` provided the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is between us. Our armed people must not see each other from different points.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peacekeeping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> UNFICYP </ORGANIZATION>, was established in 1964. Since 1974, it has patrolled the Green Line in an attempt to defuse hostilities. It has about 2,100 troops and 34 police monitors from nine nations. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a third round of talks mediated by Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on how to reconcile the Greek and Turkish communities on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> said Tuesday he has little hope the talks will result in progress toward reunifying the divided island. The <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island has been unofficially partitioned since the Greek government fomented a coup and Turkish troops moved into the northern sector in 1974 to protect the Turkish minority community. The coup failed, but about 30,000 Turkish troops remain and about 50,000 Turks moved from the mainland to settle in northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>'s government demands the removal of the Turkish troops and settlers as part of the process of establishing a national republic with two states with virtual autonomy in local affairs. <PERSON> Dentash </PERSON>'s Turkish Cypriot community declared itself a nation in 1983, but has only been recognized by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The Turkish Republic covers about 37 percent of northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, and has 120,000 residents, mostly Moslems. They form about 18 percent of the entire population of the island.

 Five Alaskan sea otters rescued from the oil-stained waters of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> were brought to <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION>, where park employees worked Tuesday to help them recover. The otters were cleaned of oil at an animal rescue center in the Alaskan port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> but they need additional care and rehabilitation, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Antrim </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> vice president and the park's general curator. The sea mammals are among the victims of the nation's worst oil spill, which occurred March 24 when an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> tanker ran aground on a reef. Ten million gallons of oil spilled into the sound. <PERSON> Antrim </PERSON> said four of the otters were `` basically in stable condition,'' while the prognosis is `` very guarded'' for the fifth. `` It's got a lower body temperature and it's not eating on its own,'' <PERSON> Antrim </PERSON> said. `` It appears to be a bit dehydrated.'' The otters arrived at Sea World late Monday night. They were flown from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in a cargo plane and then taken by truck to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Federal wildlife officials asked the park to take in the otters. Though the animals have been scrubbed, they still are threatened. `` When the animls have been fouled with oil and cleaned, they've lost their natural insulation,'' <PERSON> Antrim </PERSON> said `` So they have to be cared for and fed and observed for a period of time until their natural body oils ... can make them waterproof again.'' It will take a minimum of four to six weeks before the otters can rebuild the natural insulation vital for survival in the frigid ocean. They also may have poisoned themselves by ingesting oil while preening. Sea World plans to release the otters into the wild upon their recovery, but they might not be returned to Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses To Silence Town Bell That Keeps Couple Awake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTHAMPTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> town clock can keep on chiming at night despite a couple's lawsuit charging that it keeps them awake, a judge ruled. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said, in rejecting a request for a temporary injunction Monday, that silencing the clock until trial `` will not best serve the public's interest.'' The judge also said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnall </PERSON> failed to show they would suffer irreparable harm if the clock was allowed to continue to toll the hours. The Carnalls, who moved to the little farming community of 3,200 people last summer when the 200-year-old clock was not working, sued last month after selectmen declined to shut off the clock at night. The couple contends the clock, located in the steeple of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> about 50 feet from their home, booms the hours at 75 decibels, 15 decibels louder than a vacuum cleaner and 25 decibels above the level the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has set as the loudest people can sleep through. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said in his decision that expert testimony would be required at trial to determine decibel levels as well as the mechanical feasibility of installing a timer to shut off the chimes late at night. The Carnalls were away from home and could not be reached for comment Tuesday. But their attorney, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, said he would seek to bring the case to trial as quickly as possible. `` Most people are sympathetic to the <LOCATION> Carnalls </LOCATION>, even people who want the bell to keep ringing,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> contended.

 Chemical agents such as those applied in response to the vast oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> are of limited value in major spills but can be effective in dispersing smaller slicks, according to a study published Tuesday. The study by a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> panel of academic and industry experts said use of dispersants generally is helpful in ocean spills but more biological studies are needed to determine how coastal habitats are affected by the chemicals. The research council is an independent adviser to the government on scientific issues. Its study was conducted before last month's spill of 10 million gallons of crude oil from the Exxon Valdez, the largest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history Dispersants are most effective when applied to oil within the first five hours after a spill, the study said, adding that a day or two of evaporation and weathering cause spilled oil to become too thick to disperse with chemicals. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s application of a dispersant called Corexit was delayed for more than a day, first because the water was too cold and calm, then because strong winds that created a better environment for the dispersants hampered the aircraft used to spread the chemicals. `` Applying dispersants quickly is especially important because effective alternatives do not exist for treating ocean oil spills,'' the council report said. Dispersants usually are made of thick liquid detergent that is mixed with a solvent that thins the detergent and makes it easier to apply. The molecules of the dispersant attach themselves to the oil, reducing the surface tension between the oil and the water. This makes it easier for the oil to dissolve in the water. The report quoted <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, chairman of the experts panel, as saying, `` The mandate is clear to use chemical dispersants'' when oil must be dispersed before it reaches shore. Once oil enters coastal habitats, the decision to use chemicals is more difficult, the study said, since fish and shellfish can be harmed. For years, chemical dispersants have been suspected by some of causing more environmental harm than good. The research council report said experts who studied a 1967 oil spill off <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in which thousands of tons of dispersants were used concluded that the chemicals contributed to the deaths of local animals and plants.

 Israeli officials said they will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners on Wednesday and ease restrictions in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> for the Moslem holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. The announcement on Tuesday came on the eve of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed an <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television report that the detainees will be released Wednesday, but did not elaborate. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV said it was a good-will gesture before <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON>, which begins Friday. In the occupied lands, 10 Palestinians were reported shot and wounded Tuesday in clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing Palestinian protesters. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, dozens of reserve soldiers and officers demonstrated in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, demanding that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> end military government in the occupied lands and that talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Palestinians begin at once. `` I did 72 days of reserve duty this year, most of them in a battle against the children of the territories,'' one officer told the rally. Participants told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV the rally was not political and they would not refuse service in the territories. Security forces meanwhile arrested members of a guerrilla cell organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the army announced. It said the members, residents of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Hajja </LOCATION>, were responsible for 16 attacks that wounded 13 Israeli and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> civilians in 1986-87. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police closed the main shopping street for hours after stones were thrown at an Israeli bus, witnesses said. During a meeting with Palestinian journalists, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Arieh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramot </PERSON>, head of the military government in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, said that during <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> the government will reopen some closed mosques and schools, according to journalists who attended the meeting. He said hundreds of prisoners will be freed but did not give a specific number. More than 10,000 held in connection with the Palestinian revolt. `` I gave orders and instructions to the army to keep away from schools and mosques because I know how sensitive <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> is for Moslems, and we have no intention of killing or wounding anyone in the strip,'' <PERSON> Ramot </PERSON> told the journalists. The journalists, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Ramot </PERSON> made clear he still believed mosques and schools were centers of incitement for the uprising. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military government also planned to ease restrictions, said spokesman <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafowicz </PERSON>. `` We'll do whatever we can to keep things quiet,'' said <PERSON> Rafowicz </PERSON>. `` We are hoping for a good and holy Ramadan.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday to address American Jewish leaders before meeting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders are expected to put pressure on <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to calm the violence in the occupied territories, where the revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation has led to the deaths of 419 Palestinians. Eighteeen Israelis also have been killed. <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON>, the most important holiday for Moslems, marks the period when the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> began receiving the Koran, or Moslem holy book, from God. One of Islam's `` five pillars,'' or guiding principles, is that every Moslem must fast from sunrise to sunset during the entire month. It is also a month of religious fervor when confrontations with soldiers could boil over into violence. More than 80 percent of the 1.7 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> are Moslem. <PERSON> Rafowicz </PERSON> said steps planned in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> would be announced later in the week. All schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> have been closed for most of the 16-month revolt.

<TEXT>
 Public comments are being sought on how the 1990 wheat program should be designed, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. One of the biggest decisions will be how much land farmers will be required to take from production under the acreage reduction program, or ARP, for the 1990 crop. The idling requirement for 1989 was 10 percent of a farmer's wheat acreage base. The department said a decision will be announced no later than June 1. By law, if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpile of wheat is estimated to be less than one billion bushels at the end of the current marketing year on May 31, the following year's ARP can not exceed 20 percent. Department analysts are currently forecasting the wheat stockpile left over at the end of this marketing year at 534 million bushels. Comments may be submitted by May 14 to: Director, Commodity Analysis Division, USDA-ASCS, Room 3741-S, P.O. Box 2415, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20013.

<HEAD>That Cactus Might Be a Guardsman Gathering Intelligence on Drug Trafficking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The next cactus you see some night along the U.S.-Mexico border in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> just might be a National Guardsman gathering intelligence information on drug trafficking. National Guard troops will try to infiltrate areas of suspected drug smuggling along the border and relay intelligence to federal authorities under a $ 2.9 million program to fight narcotics trafficking in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said Tuesday. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican said the Guard is not disclosing many details of the planned foot patrols, part of a drug-trafficking package of actions including aerial surveillance and helping the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> with search and seizure of cargo crossing the border. A congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Guard troops would use camouflage paint to `` look like a cactus bush'' and then infiltrate along the border `` under cover of darkness.'' The $ 2.9 million was approved last week by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, who also authorized plans involving guardsmen in other states. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said a so-called `` long-range reconnaissance patrol'' program `` is a new program the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is not talking about.'' However, he said it involves troops who will provide additional assistance to federal agencies in a `` running war with drug-smugglers along our border.'' `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people clearly want the military more involved in our war on drugs,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It is a great step ... to enhance our ability to interdict drugs coming into our country.'' But Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Komandosky </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said he was not aware of any such foot or air patrols under the $ 2.9 million effort. `` The only money we've been allocated by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> for drug interdiction is to run a cooperative program with the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Komandosky </PERSON> said. Under that plan, some 90 to 100 volunteer, part-time guardsmen would be sent beginning Thursday to four border points of entry and the Port of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to assist customs inspectors searching for illegal drug shipments. <PERSON> Komandosky </PERSON> said he was `` positive'' the money would not be financing the air or ground patrols, unless <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> `` knows something I do n't know and that's entirely possible -LRB- that -RRB- I'm not aware of any such animal.''

 Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was sharply questioned Tuesday by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel over his failure to provide specific plans to curb the record homicide rate in the nation's capital. `` We are here in the capacity of private citizens _ outraged private citizens _ as well as public officials,'' Sen. <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., told <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> at a hearing on the crime problem held by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee `` In all this testimony we have not had a single request saying, ... ` We have a war on our hands and we need your help','' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON>, I think you're hearing something fundamental here ... ask us for the help, and specify what we are to do,'' said subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash. `` We've got to take the streets back. The hearing was held as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s drug-related murder spree continued to place the district in the international limelight. Through Tuesday, 128 people had been killed in the district, compared with 83 at the same point last year. A record 372 were killed in the district last year, and police blame 60 percent of those killings on drugs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he would recommend that more federal money be used to hire additional city police officers, but only once <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> provided him more details on current police anti-drug efforts, jail crowding problems, and anti-drug efforts. `` We want to provide the funding, but we need a basis on which to proceed,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` Give us a couple of says and we can give -LRB- you -RRB- a good short-term list,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel. `` This government has no problem asking for help, and I hope I did n't give that impression.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> repeatedly stressed that he held back on giving the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel details because he wanted to allow <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration drug policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to review a $ 102 million proposal <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> had sent him Monday. During the hearing, the mayor agreed to make public his <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> proposal, but that move did not satisfy all on the panel. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb., who described <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s written testimony as `` a <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> document,'' accused the mayor of glossing over the city's problems `` If I were to judge you on the job you're doing with drugs, and I were given a vote, I would n't vote for you,'' <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> said angrily. `` In the absence of a community committed to solving the problem, no amount of money would help.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> that his oral remarks, which <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> missed because he was at another hearing, went to the heart of the city's drug crisis <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> later acknowledged making a `` tactical error'' by not sharing with the subcommittee the plan he sent to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. An aide to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration probably will not provide all of the $ 102 million aid package the mayor has requested. Most of the money would be used to house district prisoners in federal jails and for the hiring of 700 additional police officers. `` It's hard to see how we could recommend an additional $ 100 million a year for the district,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s office has not yet come up with its own total. `` I do n't have a ballpark dollar figure at all,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. Stressing that his office had had the <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> plan `` less than 24 hours,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said it will be reviewed to see how it might agree with plans being developed by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s staff. `` It's clear that we agree on some of the things'' such as the need for more prison space, he said. The comments of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> and others indicate growing congressional concern about the district government's ability to slow the record murder rate in the nation's capital. Two weeks ago, Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, raised the possibility of a federal takeover of the police department. Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., is drafting legislation in the House that would do just that An aide to <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said his bill would be introduced by next week.

 The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said it shot and wounded a part-time police officer after one of its members was killed in bed on Tuesday while his 3-month-old daughter slept in a crib beside him. <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, 29, a father of four children, was the 26th victim of sectarian strife to die in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> this year and the 2,737 th to die in nearly 20 years of religious violence in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was shot by two men who stormed his home in <LOCATION> Balleymoney </LOCATION>, 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Police said Protestant paramilitaries were responsible for the attack. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, in messages to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> media, said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was a member of its <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antrim </LOCATION> brigade. Later Tuesday, a part-time police officer who had stopped his car at a pedestrian crossing in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> was shot and wounded by men firing from the sidewalk, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said it carried out the attack. The police officer, who was not identified, was in stable condition with wounds to his back, police said. In a third incident, police said security forces found and defused a bomb in a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> house after a two-day search after the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said it had abandoned a bomb in the area. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in the province and unite it with the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Most Protestants want <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to remain under the British flag. In another development Tuesday, a court heard how the last moments in the lives of two British soldiers slain by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> at a funeral in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> were filmed by an army helicopter hovering helplessly above. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 31, pleaded innocent to the murders on the first day of their trial at <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to last six weeks. Twenty-seven more people, three of them accused of murder, have been charged in the case and will be tried later. Prosecutor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleton </PERSON> said the helicopter crew saw <PERSON> Corporals </PERSON> <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Howes </PERSON>, 23, drive into the funeral procession for a slain member of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. He said their car was surrounded and the two soldiers dragged out, beaten, kicked, stripped almost naked, driven in a black taxi to an empty lot and thrown over a 9-foot wall. A man seen getting a gun nearby returned to the soldiers and stretched out his arm in a firing position first over one and then the other, <PERSON> Appleton </PERSON> said. Afterwards, the crowd dispersed. He said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was later found to have been shot six times and stabbed four times. <PERSON> Howes </PERSON> was shot five times. <PERSON> Appleton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> had bloodstains on their clothes of the same types as the two soldiers when they were arrested in a taxi near the spot where the soldiers' car was stopped.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The government bowed to pressure from mutinous soldiers and said Tuesday it released from jail and deported three army officers who tried to overthrow <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> leader Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. Rebels surrendered control of the international airport, which reopened Tuesday for the first time since Sunday's coup attempt. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said there no longer appeared to be any active resistance in the army to the government. `` I think there's no doubt that President <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> is completely in control now,'' said embassy spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>. `` There are no signs of a continuation of the coup attempt against him.'' A government communique identified the three alleged coup conspirators as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Himmler </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebu </PERSON>, commander of the Leopards Battalion; Col. <PERSON> Phillipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biamby </PERSON>, commander of the Presidential Guard; and Col. <PERSON> Leonce </PERSON> <PERSON> Qualo </PERSON>, an administrative officer at army headquarters. The government accused Rebu, <PERSON> Biamby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Qualo </PERSON> of a `` foolhardy'' attempt to overthrow the government but said <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> had `` magnanimously'' decided to free them from arrest on humanitarian grounds. The communique, read on state-run TV, said the three were given safe passage to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and were driven Monday night to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> border for a flight out. <PERSON> Rebu </PERSON> was accompanied by his wife and four children. <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> Leopard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> had accepted their new commander, Col. <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> _ a strong indication the insurgency had ended. In <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources said the Haitians crossed the border at dawn. It was not known how long they would remain in the country before flying to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Release of the coup leaders was seen mainly as an attempt to appease soldiers of the elite, 300-man <ORGANIZATION> Leopard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> who were demanding freedom for Rebu, their commander. At least four mutinous soldiers in the battalion were killed Monday in skirmishes with troops loyal to <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. The rebels briefly seized control of national television station Monday before being evicted by the Presidential Guard, and held the airport until late Monday night. The airport was reopened Tuesday, but all commercial flights into the country had been canceled earlier. Schools remained closed, but most stores in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, the capital, were opened by midday Tuesday and traffic was picking up steadily. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, who assumed power six months ago in a coup led by non-commissioned officers demanding democratic reforms, narrowly escaped the attempt to topple his government. Loyal troops rescued him Sunday as he was being led to the airport to be deported to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Motives for the coup attempt remained unclear, and it was not known whether <PERSON> Rebu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Biamby </PERSON> and Qualo were the only officers involved. The state-run daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> L'Union </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Rebu </PERSON> was the `` main ringleader,'' and said he and the other conspirators were arrested and held under military guard at the National Palace. There was speculation the coup attempt was prompted by fears that a crackdown by <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> on illegal drugs within the army might lead to widespread dismissals of officers suspected of corruption. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> last week dismissed four high-ranking army officers accused of drug trafficking. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied giving the <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> government a list of officers it wanted cashiered from the army because of alleged involvement in drug trafficking. `` No, we did not,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said when asked about the suggestion that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand led to the attempted coup. She said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, a department envoy, had visited <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and discussed with <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> `` the broad range of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, which would include narcotic cooperation, along with democratic reforms, respect for human rights and credible development programs.'' `` We did not deliver any list of names; nor did we give any kind of ultimatum,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that the army high command had discharged five lieutenant colonels. Among them was Lt. Col. <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, who has been linked in the past with brutal treatment of dissident peasants. The report gave no explanation for the dismissals, and the significance of the move was not immediately clear. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronceray </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> opposition politician, said he believed the coup attempt was financed by elements of the army linked to the corrupt <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dynasty and `` threatened to plunge <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> into chaos.'' Another opposition leader, <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerre </PERSON>, said although <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> appeared to be in control, the situation remained volatile. `` The affair is not over,'' he said. `` The contradictions in the army still exist and may explode at any time.''

He will manage day-to-day operations while Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> serves as chief executive officer and spokeswoman for the center. `` After being charged, super-charged and turbo-charged, I hope I can say I am in charge,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. He used his first minutes as president to make an appeal for money, saying building an endowment for the center is a top priority. `` It's not about what <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> wants,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` It's about what the King Center needs. Read my lips: money. `` The time has come. The generation before us has paved the way.'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, whose husband was assassinated in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, on April 4, 1968, said she felt `` a mother's pride'' in sharing the center's leadership with her son. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who had been scheduled to attend but was grounded in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> because of bad weather, encouraged King via telephone to maintain the `` rhythm and momentum'' of the civil rights movement. `` <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON>, there'll be no cure in heavy moments,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Your young leadership means so much to those of us who watched you grow. ... Your energy and strength and work are what we need.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> is ready to work closely with The King Center under <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s leadership.

At <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s request, he agreed to give up the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> position and remain at the Pentagon.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said Tuesday the 4-day-old independence process in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is in danger of collapsing because of fierce fighting between security forces and black nationalist guerrillas. Foreign Affairs Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> wrote <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> de Cueller on Tuesday that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was considering suspending the implementation of independence in the territory. `` Unless active and effective measures are taken within the next few hours to stem the rapid deterioration of the situation, the whole peace process in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is in danger of collapse,'' said his letter, released in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. At least 169 guerrillas, 19 police and one South African soldier have been killed since Saturday in clashes across <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern border with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, according to police and military officials <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> accused <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, of sending 1,200 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas from southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> into northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in a deliberate attempt to sabotage the peace process. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigation found the guerrillas had launched a `` major incursion'' from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in violation of the peace plan, according to diplomats in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday urged <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas to pull back into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and allow the Namibian independence process to get under way. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> does not think the agreement was in danger of unraveling `` at this point.'' British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also condemned what she called a rebel incursion into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and said the incursion caused the fighting. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> wrote, `` The South African government can not be expected to implement its undertakings ... while <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> continues to act in flagrant violation of the provisions'' approved by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, all <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas are to remain at their bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> at least 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s border until mid-May. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said 4,450 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> fighters now are south of that line. He also said hundreds of Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, in tandem with <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> fighters, had moved to within 650 yards of the Namibian border. `` In such circumstances, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has the undoubted right to suspend its compliance with its obligations,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s letter added. Fighting broke out Saturday, the day the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> began supervising a yearlong independence plan for the territory that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has controlled for 74 years. South African military officials say the fighting is the heaviest since the 1966 start of the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> war against <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television showed bodies of more than a dozen guerrillas killed in one clash. Journalists toured northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and saw evidence of heavy fighting, but casualty figures could not be independently confirmed. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> officials say the guerrillas were in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for some time and that South African-led forces initiated the fighting. `` Our people have been fighting inside <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in the past 20 years,'' <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> told reporters after meeting in <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, with representatives from the the five permanent member nations of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said he planned to end two decades of exile and return to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> `` very soon.'' He asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to bolster its cease-fire monitoring forces in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> authorized 4,650 troops for the <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> operation, but only about 1,000 have arrived and no more than 300 are in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces made no effort to intervene in the fighting and say it is not part of their mandate. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the fighting did not mean <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping efforts had broken down. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s special representative to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, traveled Tuesday from the capital of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> to the war zone. The Namibian territorial police force, composed mostly of black Namibians commanded by white <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, has done most of the fighting against the guerrillas. The makeup of the territorial army is similar. The South African army units in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> are virtually all-white. About 1,500 South African and Namibian soldiers, belonging to the territorial army and the South African army, were given <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> permission to leave their bases and support the police. `` Our people are being butchered under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> flag,'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Theo-Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON> said Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, since World War I, when it took control of the former German colony. The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December when <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> signed a peace accord that calls for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops supporting Marxist <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Besides granting <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independence, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is to end military aid to right-wing rebels in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan, elections are to be held in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in November, leading to independence early next year.

 Students protesting government austerity measures battled police Tuesday. Officials said one demonstrator and a policeman were injured and 30 people were arrested. Police reinforcements rushed to <LOCATION> Catia </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> suburb, when hundreds of youths began burning tires after bus drivers refused to give students a 50 percent fare discount authorized by a government decree. A police spokesman said of the injured: `` The policeman was shot in a leg with a projectile and the student sustained several injuries from plastic shotgun pellets.'' Students outside the <ORGANIZATION> Caracas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venezuela </ORGANIZATION> later seized a bus and set it on fire. No casualties or arrests were reported. In <LOCATION> Maracaibo </LOCATION>, 300 miles west of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, most university and public high school classes were suspended Tuesday, the day after students burned a bus and a police truck. The Maracaibo protesters also said bus drivers were not allowing the discount for students and were charging them full fare. Demonstrations have been frequent since the government began applying in February the provisions of an economic package approved by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. Bus fares were increased, but the government earmarked $ 10 million to subsidize the 50 percent discount for students. Transport companies said the reduced fares did n't cover their expenses. More than 300 people were killed in riots that erupted Feb. 27 to protest price increases. Most of the deaths were in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, where about 3,000 stores were looted. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>' Social Democratic administration has continued to implement its `` economic adjustment plan'' based on <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> guidelines that include the reduction or removal of many government subsidies. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s inflation is expected to exceed 70 percent this year.

 Tranquilized caribou were loaded onto a van Tuesday and carried north toward their new home in the wilderness under a plan to restore the reindeer-like animal in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Six to eight caribou, some weighing as much as 250 pounds, were to be taken to <LOCATION> Baxter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a 200,000-acre wilderness preserve. After being shot with tranquilizer guns, the ungainly creatures were lifted on canvas stretchers and carried onto a van for the 70-mile journey. Blindfolded to reduce stress, they were placed side by side on a bed of straw. Scientists hope the animals will use their new home as a breeding ground. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s once-abundant caribou were wiped out in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> by overhunting and disease. The last native woodland caribou to be seen in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> was spotted in 1908 on mile-high <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Katahdin </LOCATION> in the park's southern end. Dr. <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> <PERSON> Heldenbrand </PERSON>, a veterinarian monitoring the animals, was optimistic about the animals' chances of flourishing in the wild. The biggest threats to the caribou are parasites and predators, <PERSON> Heldenbrand </PERSON> said. `` We hope the public is educated enough to leave them alone,'' he said. `` They're the public's animals. We hope they will respect them.'' Release of the 1 - and 2-year-old caribou caps a two-year effort begun in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> Biologists and state officials in 1986 had more than two dozen rounded up in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> and trucked 1,200 miles to the University of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Calves born since then will be the nucleus of the new herd. By Wednesday, officials hoped to have transported 14 of the docile, tan animals to Baxter State Park, officials said. The animals will be fitted with radio collars so scientists can keep track of them and determine whether they are being pursued by coyotes and bears, said biologist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollough </PERSON>, director of the privately funded project.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on Tuesday accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of trying to use a regional peace effort to get rid of the Contra rebels without giving up anything in return. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> told a news conference <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government refuses to talk to the U.S.-backed rebels. `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> does n't want to solve the political and social crisis in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' Contreras charged. `` It ... just wants a bilateral accord with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to fix the problem of the Contras.'' Between 10,000 and 11,000 Contra fighters and their families began moving into Honduran base camps near the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last spring after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid ended and a cease-fire began. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which announced another of its monthly, unilateral extensions of the cease-fire Tuesday, had no immediate comment on the Honduran charges. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> should offer internal political conditions that permit the quick return of the Contras, their families and more than 40,000 Nicaraguan refugees that have been in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> since 1981.'' <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> wants the Contras `` to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as quickly as possible. But this is the responsibility of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, who absolutely refuse to talk with the Contras,'' he said. In February, the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> agreed to come up with a plan by mid-May for disarming the rebels and for their voluntary repatriation or relocation. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> also agreed to hold free elections next year. The accord has bogged down over the timing of the repatriation in relation to the elections. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which scheduled elections for February 1990, wants the rebel force dismantled quickly. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said the `` outlook for regional peace is very gray and appears stalled. The signs are not good. The problem of the Contras has not been resolved.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> acknowledged intense arguments over timing and said the Contras should return at the same time as the Sandinistas make democratic reforms. `` You can not persuade the Contras to go back to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> ... if you have nothing for them there,'' he told reporters after a meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> `` stubbornly refuse'' to talk with the Contras. He and his Central American counterparts ended a two-day meeting last week without agreeing on demobilization of the Contras. They also postponed the next summit from May 15, the deadline for coming up with a plan to dismantle the Contras, to June 15. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said implementing the presidential accord will be `` difficult'' unless the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> agree to talk, directly or indirectly, to the rebels. `` Lamentably, the problem has negative repercussions for the entire region,'' he said. `` We hope the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> might meditate on the future of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and change their attitude.

<TEXT>
 The federal commission that recommended shutting down 86 military bases and partly closing five more was optimistic in its assessment that the move will save $ 5.6 billion over 20 years, a congressional budget official said Tuesday. `` The commission's estimates of savings fell at the upper end of the range suggested by our data,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, assistant director at the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` Unfortunately, missing historical data and differences in definitions make comparisons of one-time costs and savings unclear.'' The commission did not include the cost of federal economic assistance in estimating the plan's savings but did include the expected revenues from sale of the land presently used by the bases, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. However, the office's analysis found that of the 33 bases closed during the 1970s, the government only got 35 percent of the fair-market value for sale of the land. In some cases, the property was donated for educational use and other public services. The commission estimated savings of $ 694 million a year, with 20-year savings estimated at $ 5.6 billion. `` Based on the historic data, they were optimistic ... not wildly so,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittees on defense and military construction. Lawmakers expressed concerns about the commission's recommendations at two separate <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings while acknowledging the plan will likely go into effect next month and base closings will begin in 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can block the proposal, which former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> approved in January, but the chances are unlikely. The House Armed Services panel voted 43-4 last month to support the commission's recommendations to close 86 facilities, partially close five others and change the mission in 54 other installations. The full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to follow suit later this month. Nevertheless, legislators held hearings to question the planned closing of some of their local bases. At the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on readiness, sustainability and support, Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., cited recently unclassified transcripts of the commission's meetings in which members discussed time constraints that prohibited a more extensive examination of available data on each base <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> argued against the planned closing of <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and railed against the rating system the commission used to make its decision. `` Who was the mother, father or brainchild of the rating system,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> asked. `` A lot of people on the commission staff,'' responded Dr. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, executive director of the commission staff. Seated behind <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> were 10 members of his staff and <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> called on each one to stand and give their name. The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator also asked the staff members to write down their names and addresses. `` The commission gave responsibility to faceless people,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said.

 More than 200 <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys submitted a petition Tuesday to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> criticizing the department's attempt to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion. `` We believe that every woman has the right to make her own decision about whether or not to continue her pregnancy in accordance with the guidelines set forth in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' the petition said, referring to the 1973 case. `` We oppose any governmental interference with this basic right.'' The petition bearing 248 names, most of them attorneys, was given to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s office late in the afternoon, according to one of the signers. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, a top aide to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, said the petition `` wo n't have any impact on the department's position. `` These people come in six months after the decision was made to appeal this case to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` It's not timely. ... If they wanted to have an impact on what the department was doing on this, they're six months too late.'' One of the signers, an attorney who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the petition was submitted late because attorneys at the department are very busy and it took a long time to get the organization in motion. In addition, she said the signers hope the petition will make an impact on other cases. She said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and the department had involved themselves in partisan politics by intervening in the case. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said he did n't expect any retaliation against the people who signed the petition, saying, `` The attorney general understands this is a controversial issue that people disagree on.'' `` I do n't anticipate any impact ... unless people decide that they so disagree that they can no longer work here,'' he said. The case before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is called <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services, and it concerns a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law that prohibits the use of public funds or public employees from `` encouraging'' or `` performing'' or `` assisting'' an abortion. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected key portions of the law last July 13. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> could act on the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> case without touching the 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision, but the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in a brief filed in February, urged the court to overturn its earlier ruling and leave decisions on abortions to legislators. The signer who commented on the petition said the majority of those who signed are women. She said the many female attorneys at Justice give the issue relevance, serving as reminders that their ability to pursue careers would be compromised by unwanted pregnancies. <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> praised the employees who signed the petition. `` Quite apart from the issue of what the department is doing on <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, it's heartening to know there are a few government lawyers willing to exercise their First Amendment rights,'' she said. `` The attorney general obviously can respond any way he wants to that petition, but he of all people has to know that his employees should not bear any recriminations for expressing their views on an issue as important as this one,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said.

 Eighteen months after it was convicted of selling bogus apple juice to consumers, the <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been debarred from doing any business with the federal government through 1991. The corporation, suspended from federal contracting since December 1986, is now being debarred `` to protect the government's interest in doing business only with contractors who conduct business with honesty and integrity,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s order states The debarment, which <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> contested, was announced Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The company was advised of the decision in a letter dated March 3, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> added. A suspension is normally the first step toward a company either being debarred or allowed to resume bidding on government work. A contract debarment is the harshest administrative sanction the Pentagon can impose on a contractor. Such an order, whose term can vary, prevents a company from bidding on or receiving any new contract from any agency of the federal government _ not just the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION>'s case, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced in January it was changing the suspension of the <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a wholly owned subsidiary, to a debarment. By taking the same action Tuesday against the parent <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Pentagon has barred any and all units of the corporation from receiving any government contract `` through Dec. 4, 1991.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was convicted Nov. 13, 1987, in federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on a total of 215 counts involving charges of introducing adulterated food into commerce and violating the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. `` The criminal conduct of Beech-Nut Nutrition involved manufacturing juice for babies which was labeled as and represented to be pure apple juice, but in fact contained little, if any, apple or fruit juice,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> noted in its order. The financial impact of Tuesday's action on the company appears slight. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> purchases Beech-Nut products for resale in military commissaries around the world. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he could not immediately estimate the value of the government's business to the company before it was suspended in 1986. Other Pentagon officials said, however, the total was well below $ 1 million a year. Nonetheless, the company had strongly fought the debarment action since being advised of the possibility last December, arguing an entirely new management team had taken over and any damage that had been incurred had been incurred by consumers and not the federal government. `` The government bought the juice for resale to military members and their families in commissaries,'' countered <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Werfel </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION>'s special assistant for contracting integrity, in the debarment order. `` The government paid for 100 percent pure apple juice, received artificial juice, and government employees were offered the artificial juice while assuming that the juice was 100 percent pure applie juice. To say that the government was not damaged in these circumstances is further evidence of <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION>'s continuing lack of responsibility.'' <PERSON> Werfel </PERSON> added the evidence was clearly sufficient to show that `` the <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was and is responsible for the actions of <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, including its criminal activity from December 1981 through March 1983.'' Beech-Nut, which is headquartered in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said it found the <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION>'s action `` inexplicable.'' `` It is beyond question that our products today are authentic, pure and safe,'' added a company spokesman, who asked not to be named. `` This happened nearly six years ago, and stringent quality control programs were put in place by the new management. We are puzzled by this move and find it inexplicable that <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION> is impugning the current management by this action.''

 Namibian guerrilla chief <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> vowed Tuesday he would shortly return to his homeland, scene of the bloodiest clashes between security forces and guerrillas in 23 years of war. His return would effectively end more than two decades as an exile, wanted by the South African rulers of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> as a terrorist. But aides said it would not be his first visit home. `` He has been in and out with his men quite often,'' said one official, who spoke on condition of not being identified. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> addressed a news conference after he urged the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to immediately bolster its cease-fire monitoring forces in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Asked if he would be going to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> replied, `` Yes, very soon.'' <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> reiterated denials that 1,200 of his men infiltrated <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in violation of the cease-fire accord, insisting `` our people have been fighting inside <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in the past 20 years.'' He said that in his 90-minute talks Tuesday with mission chiefs of the five permament <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ he expressed `` utter disgust over the killing of innocent Namibians, some of whom were celebrating the start of the cease-fire.'' A cease-fire is the initial stage of an independence transition period for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, a onetime German colony ruled for the last 74 years by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said he urged the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> through the envoys to stop the South African-led security forces `` from butchering Namibians and confine the South African army to their barracks.'' He described as `` full-scale war'' the fighting that first broke out last Saturday, the day the cease-fire was to go into effect. The combat has killed 169 of his fighters, 19 police and one South African soldier. Meeting with <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> were <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fugat </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> while appointment of a new ambassador is awaited; British High Commissioner -LRB- ambassador -RRB- <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Melhuish </PERSON>; and ambassadors <PERSON> Arrkadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gloukhou </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Song Ghoqing of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Garriague-Guyonnaud </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, who directs <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> from exile in the Angolan capital of <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, is expected to discuss the crisis this week with leaders of the so-called Front-line states _ black African nations that border on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or are particularly concerned with events there. That regional bloc _ <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> _ spearheads African efforts to end <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of apartheid, or racial segregation.

<HEAD>California Panel To Issue Appeal Ruling On Spiro Agnew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state board is expected to rule later this week whether former Vice President <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> can get a refund on his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> taxes for money he had to pay to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> as restitution in a kickback case. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> is appealing a 1986 denial by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franchise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> of his request for a refund of $ 24,197. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>, who pleaded no contest to corruption charges and resigned as vice president in 1973, paid $ 142,000 in restitution for allegedly accepting bribes from road engineering contractors while he was governor of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> from 1967 to 1969. The former vice president views the court-ordered restitution as an expenditure and wants to recover a percentage of it, said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertane </PERSON>, senior counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equalization </ORGANIZATION>, the appellate panel. The board's ruling will be issued Thursday, the attorney said. `` It's fairly routine. It does n't present any extremely novel legal questions,'' <PERSON> Bertane </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> originally sought the deduction on his 1981 tax return, filed after he became a resident of Rancho Mirage and just months after he made restitution. The Franchise <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 rejected the deduction because `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has never received any income, in the form of taxes or otherwise, from the amounts -LRB- <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> -RRB- allegedly received as bribes.'' To approve the deduction, the board said, would have the effect of requiring <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> taxpayers to subsidize <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>'s `` return of public monies to the taxpayers of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, urged the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equalization </ORGANIZATION> to `` ignore the identity of those involved.''

</TEXT>
<NOTE>On Fidel Castro and Cuba's recent history:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> we know why the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> people rose to make their revolution, what enabled them to repulse the armed intervention, survive the economic blockade, cope with the persistent and exhausting pressure of their imperialist neighbor. The island of freedom was able to stand its ground thanks to its proud and courageous people determined to fight for their independence, for their right to live as they see fit. They were able to do so because the revolution brought to the country's helm a party committed to achieving lofty socialist ideals, ideals of serving the people. And finally they were able to do this because history had placed at their head one of the outstanding revolutionaries of the 20th century, the legendary Comrade <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On Soviet-Cuban relations:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Our solidarity is not subject to fluctuations caused by the considerations of the moment. Life does not mark time, time presents us with new requirements and this applies particularly to economic links. They must be made more dynamic, more effective, they must do more for both our countries, our peoples. As for today, it is absolutely essential that there be more strictness, discipline, so that undertakings assumed be carried out in good time, and with proper standards. Today only those can count on success who are marching in step with the times, who are drawing the necessary conclusions from the changes resulting from the fact that the world has entered the era of high technology, of intellectual labor, of the decisive role of science. We are convinced that the potentialities included in socialism are enormous, but they are not realized of their own accord.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On internal Soviet politics:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Why is it that in outer space we perform miracles and in everyday life we are unable to meet the most pressing demands? Why is it that our progress has grown slower, and how has it happened that in our society there are phenomena alien to socialism, social corrosion, apathy, selfishness? Even the present state of reform has shown what a positive charge is inherent in these changes. This is most important of all. ... There is maximalism among some people, among valuable proposals there are some that are controversial, some that are unacceptable. This is understandable. It is due to our lack of experience, poltical culture, but all that will come. We see how people are straightening out their shoulders, how their social stature is growing, how they are learning to solve problems in conditions of democratization and glasnost. We do not regard our approaches and solutions as some universal prescription for all. On the contrary, problems may be similar but each party solves them in its own way, guided by its own notions and the specific features of its country. From these diverse unstereotyped approaches there emerges the international experience of socialism which is helping us all to move forward more rapidly.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On foreign policy:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 As in the past the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have a common approach to the key problems of international affairs. We are united in our desire for a stable peace to avert the nuclear threat, to assert the unconditional right of the nations to choosing their destiny, to changing on a fair basis international economic relations. Of course the assertion of new thinking in the minds of the world public is a complicated matter. Too strong are the traditions and stereotypes and habits of the past. We see how hard it is to digest for some of the Western leaders who time and again slip from recognition of security to recurrency of the policy of strength, to attempts to force their will on others. The most immediate task now is to solve so-called regional conflicts. Analyzing their causes, it is easy to come to the conclusion that they often emerge due to interference from the outside and the striving to force order on others, that is attempts to interfere with other people in their attempt to make their own choice. We are resolutely against any theories and doctrines justifying the export of revolution or counterrevolution, and all forms of foreign interference in the affairs of sovereign nations.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Afghanistan:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, too, has been inclined to continue meddling in Afghan affairs. True, those who believed that the Republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would be dismembered the next day after the Soviet troops were withdrawn have begun to recognize that they failed to take a realistic view of the strength and possibilities of the Afghan regime. We in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> believe that the Afghan conflict and the way of settling it is a touchstone for all states, for the entire world community. There are other regional conflicts, other regional knots that have to be untangled and it's very important to diplay responsibility and a constructive approach.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Angola:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 It is of basic importance that not only <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s independence has been defended, there also have appeared feasible prospects of finding an end to the infamous legacy of the colonial period, the enslavement of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> whose people will now be able to set up an independent state of their own and join the equal family of African nations. This is going to be a major victory for justic and common sense in international affairs.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Middle East:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 That region ... has been turned into a storage place of much inflammable material, but not only in the figurative sense. It would be unpardonable light-mindedness to assume that such a state of affairs could exist indefinitely in the future. Getting the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> knot untangled is in the direct interest not only of direct parties in the conflict, the Arab nations and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but also <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and of course the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other socialist countries. That is why we believed and believe still that it is necessary to step up efforts in the interests of a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Nicaragua:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Of course the normalization of situation in that country should in many respects depend on the positions of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We believe that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> still clings to its position of strength in tackling the situation in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We can not agree with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s statements that give a wrong picture of our relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. We are for a central, regional settlement of the conflict in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on the basis of a dialogue of all parties concerned without any outside interference and ensuring the rights of each of the peoples to self-determination. We can not agree with statement of Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> which tends to view the situation in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as in the backyard of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Latin America:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Favoring greater cooperation with the countries of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is not looking for any political or military and strategic benefits in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. We believe that continent, like all others, should not be an arena for conflict between East and West. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has no and does not intend to have naval, air force or missile bases in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, or deploy nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction there.

<HEAD>Paper Says Imelda Will Embalm Marcos for Display</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> says she will embalm her husband's body when he dies and display it in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> until she can return and scatter his ashes to `` fertilize'' the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported Tuesday. `` Not only will it be a political statement: It will be a spectacle _ an international spectacle to have <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> -LRB- lie is state -RRB- here,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> BusinessWorld </ORGANIZATION> in an interview at the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> home in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> over the weekend. President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his family and several cronies fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> when a military-civilian uprising in February 1986 put <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in power. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, has been hospitalized in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since Jan. 15 with heart and lung ailments. Hospital officials say he remains in guarded condition. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has repeatedly rejected requests that the former president be allowed to return. Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> said in February the president and <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> had agreed, for security reasons, that not even his body would be allowed into the country. The paper quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as saying: `` I'll keep <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> here until 1992, then I'll bring him home.'' President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s term ends in that year. In May, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother died at age 95, and her body was embalmed and put on display. Relatives say they are waiting to bury <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> until the former president returns. Her body lies in state at the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> home in <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION>, 240 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. A mortician visits every two months to inject embalming fluid and retouch the makeup on her face. <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was quoted as expressing optimism that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s successor would let them return and fulfill a wish of her husband to be cremated and have his ashes scattered `` to fertilize his country.'' She is more than 20 years younger than her husband and once was groomed to succeed him, but the paper quoted her as saying she had no intention of running for the presidency in 1992. `` I've seen it all,'' she said. `` I've had it all. Now all I want is to be left alone.'' The Marcoses have been indicted on racketeering charges by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> grand jury. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent at her arraignment last October but the former president's arraignment has been postponed because of his health. They are accused of stealing more than $ 100 million of public funds and using it to buy real estate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Aquino government says the Marcoses and their associates plundered at least $ 10 billion during his 20 years in power.

 A Peruvian jetliner carrying 137 people crashed and burst into flames as it landed at a jungle airport, injuring 11 passengers and crew members, <ORGANIZATION> Faucett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. It said the others escaped unharmed. The privately owned airline said the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 crashed at 6:43 p.m. Monday at the airport in <LOCATION> Iquitos </LOCATION>, 715 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, during a heavy rainstorm. It said the craft skidded off the edge of the runway, a landing gear and the right wing broke off and fire broke out. The pilot and co-pilot were among the 11 injured, all of whom were Peruvians, according to <ORGANIZATION> Faucett </ORGANIZATION>. It said most of the injuries were minor but two people were hospitalized. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION> news agency said earlier 130 people were aboard the jet and 14 were injured, suffering second-degree burns or hurt when they leaped to safety as flames engulfed the plane. It said some of the people jumped from the plane even before it came to a halt. <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION>'s account gave a slightly different version of the accident. It said the airliner tilted sideways when it was about 1,500 feet from the runway and one engine exploded in flames. The nose of the craft rammed into the runway and both wings tore off as the plane skidded along the tarmac, according to <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION>. It said the flames destroyed the fuselage, but <LOCATION> Iquitos </LOCATION> airport officials reported the fire damage to the fuselage was minor. The airport officials also said the fire broke out after the plane had landed and went out of control. <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION> said there had been no indications that the jetliner, Flight 302 en route to <LOCATION> Iquitos </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, had encountered earlier difficulties. Airport officials blamed the crash on `` unfavorable climatic conditions and strong tropical rains.''

Supervisor <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Holifield </PERSON> said that he would support plastering over the signs because `` obviously they are offensive to some people.''

 Democrats were favored to hold an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> congressional seat in a special election Tuesday that amounted to a test run for Republicans hoping to gain ground in the Deep South in 1990. Secretary of State <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Browder </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee, faced a lesser-known Republican foe, state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Opelika </LOCATION>, in a roughhouse, name-calling race for the 3rd Congressional District seat. The seat was left vacant in December with the death of Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, a conservative Democrat from <LOCATION> Sylacauga </LOCATION> who held the mostly rural, 13-county east <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> district for 22 years. The district, which is about 75 percent white and dotted with small towns, appeared ready-made for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to bring such conservative-leaning Southern seats into the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> column next year. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> captured over 60 percent of the district's votes last November. But Democrats sought a second straight off-year special election victory over Republicans.

 Divers pulled a car from the <LOCATION> Hatchie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Tuesday and recovered from it the body of an eighth victim of a weekend bridge collapse that may have been caused by flood damage. Four state inspection teams fanned out across western <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to check other bridges for weather damage. State Transportation Commissioner <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said heavy spring floods after two years of drought probably contributed to the collapse Saturday night by washing sandy soil away from the bridge supports. `` We're trying to make sure there's nothing that we have overlooked in this area,'' he said. The body found Tuesday in a gray compact station wagon was not immediately identified. Seven other victims were recovered earlier. Crews searching the flooded river earlier in the day discovered signs of a possible fifth vehicle lost when a 90-foot section of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 51 bridge gave way. A dog trained to smell bodies buried in rubble or under water pointed searchers to a section of the river adjacent to the accident on Monday. The object's position was confirmed Tuesday by a boat crew using a magnet, and a wrecker pulled the car out in the afternoon. Crews also set up a crane to lift away the concrete slabs covering at least three other cars and a tractor-trailer. Workers had used jackhammers since the accident to break up the three slabs into pieces small enough to be raised by the crane. State officials said the collapse about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> may have been caused by flood waters washing out the soil around the bridge supports. The span that collapsed was 55 years old and carried two lanes of northbound traffic. The adjacent bridge, which carried southbound traffic, was not damaged but has been closed.

<TEXT>
 Negotiators worked against the clock to resolve differences so the government and opposition can sign a historic pact Wednesday to make Solidarity legal again and bring free elections to communist <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Although last-minute agreements on trade unions and political reforms were announced between Solidarity and authorities Tuesday night, it was still uncertain if an overall pact would be signed Wednesday. The opposition said an objection to Solidarity's wage indexing plan by the official trade union organization, OPZZ, could undo the entire deal on political and economic reforms after two months of grueling bargaining. `` We are in a deep and serious impasse,'' said Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>. He said Solidarity's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will meet in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Wednesday morning to decide if Solidarity could sign the accords without <ORGANIZATION> OPZZ </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement on a formula for indexing pay to the cost of living. `` Today we can only say that all possibilities are open,'' he said when asked at a news conference if the free trade union movement might sign a partial accord or refuse to sign any accord at all. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, exhausted after a 10-hour negotiating session, went home to <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> Tuesday. Spokesmen said he would return to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in time for any signing ceremony. Negotiators reached a final agreement on trade unions Tuesday that would restore Solidarity's legal status and reinstate people fired for union activity after the December 1981 imposition of martial law, Solidarity negotiator <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkel </PERSON> announced. A team on political reforms successfully concluded talks late Tuesday night, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. The accord included bringing the opposition into <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> gave no details, but earlier <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said Solidarity won a concession that a two-thirds majority in the Sjem, or parliament, would be required to override the new senate's veto of parliamentary measures. Authorities had wanted a smaller majority to be able to override the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to become a bastion of the opposition. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> also said the Politburo, the top <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> body led by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leader, Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, met Tuesday to discuss preparations for a final signing on Wednesday. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, also headed by <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, meanwhile reviewed proposed changes in the constititution before they were sent to parliament. An extraordinary committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> focused its discussions on the proposed new senate and presidency, key elements of the round-table agreements between authorities and Solidarity, the agency reported. If a final agreement is signed Wednesday, parliament would meet as early as Friday to enact the agreements into law, the government has said. Monday would see the beginning of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first open, competitive election campaign since Communists consolidated power after World War II, opposition sources said. The opposition tentatively set two meetings this weekend to plan for the elections. The Communist Party has scheduled a pre-election conference May 4-5. Authorities proposed the round-table negotiations in August during strikes that roughly coincided with the anniversary of Solidarity's founding in the labor turmoil of 1980. Leaders of the official unions opposed Solidarity's indexing formula to increase wages by 80 percent of the inflation rate. They want payments of 100 percent of inflation regardless of a worker's pay Under the OPZZ formula, if the average cost of living went up by 50,000 zlotys in a given month, that sum would go to a worker earning 50,000 as well as to one earning 150,000. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s annual inflation rate is more than 60 percent, shortages of consumer goods are chronic and the foreign debt is $ 39 billion. A statement the official unions adopted Monday said the Solidarity formula would `` not contribute to a cooling down of unrest but can even lead to its aggravation.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciemny </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday, however, that the official unions wanted to work the problem out and `` if the issue of indexation was to break up this table ... something is wrong.'' The government created OPZZ to replace Solidarity when the independent union movement was banned in 1982 under martial law, but the official alliance has taken an independent, militant position in the talks. If Solidarity becomes legal again, OPZZ will lose its union monopoly and have to compete for worker support. Negotiators reached a broad outline of agreement early in the negotiations, which began Feb. 6.

 Relatives of the captain of the oil tanker that spilled its load in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> told police he wanted to surrender to face Alaskan charges but was awaiting advice from his attorney, an official said Tuesday. Law enforcement authorities said they are not sure where <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> is, but a source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the captain left <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> last week on a flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` We talked to his parents last night,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` They told us something will probably be happening soon.'' `` But they said it was up to the attorney to decide when and where,'' he added. But after <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> law enforcement authorities waited a second day for <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> to turn himself in, the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office announced there would be no surrender on Tuesday. A lawyer for <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> talked with the district attorney on Tuesday, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>. The attorney, who was not identified, gave no indication when a surrender would take place, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, a 20-year veteran of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, is accused of being drunk when the supertanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef March 24 and spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. He has been fired. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, who also live in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, told police they did not know where their son is. `` There was no deal cut,'' said <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>. `` We told the family that it would be better for him, down the road, to turn himself in voluntarily.'' If <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, does not surrender within the next two days police will actively pursue him, <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> said. `` Right now if we see him on the streets, we will lock him up,'' said <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>. `` We are anxious to bring him into custody.'' The captain is charged with operating a ship while drunk, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. The charges, all misdemeanors, carry up to two years and three months in prison and a $ 10,000 fine.

<HEAD>Petition Calling For Amnesty Given To Congress</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A petition calling for the release of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political prisoners and signed by 24,000 people was given to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature a week after it was seized by customs officers, state media said Tuesday The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said customs officials in <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> forwarded the petition to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which closed its annual session Tuesday. The petition was seized last Tuesday from a group of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> human rights activists who were attempting to bring it into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A day later, the activists brought their case to the legislature and requested that the petition be forwarded to the congress. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted a spokesman of the <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> customs office as saying the request had been granted `` to respect the right of those <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> compatriots who took part in the signing to express their views and suggestions.'' The official said other materials seized, such as magazines and pro-democracy periodicals, would not be released. The petition was signed by 24,163 people. Most of the signatories were Chinese from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and the West, but people from 34 other countries also participated. The petition demanded specifically that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> release <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, serving a 15-year sentence for `` counterrevolutionary'' crimes. <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> was arrested 10 years ago after he called for democracy. A growing number of intellectuals in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are calling for an amnesty for political prisoners. Since January, intellectuals here have written four open letters urging an amnesty and democratic change. So far, about 200 people have signed. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights group, estimates that Chinese jails hold thousands of prisoners jailed for their beliefs. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has ruled out an amnesty and says it has no political prisoners. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report said customs officers seized the petition and the periodicals under a law that prohibits people from bringing items `` in excess of their personal use.'' Members of the group said they believed the seizure of the petition did not bode well for human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and for the future Chinese treatment of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a British colony since the 19th century, returns to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has guaranteed to keep <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s liberal economic and political system in place for 50 years but many <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> intellectuals are skeptical. In a related development, students at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday authorities there are forbidding students from meeting to discuss democracy and political change in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A poster that appeared on a wall Monday urged the university to `` protect our rights of freedom of speech and association.'' By Tuesday afternoon, it had been taken down. The poster, signed by more than 60 students, said democratic change in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` is not simply a matter of saying a few empty words.'' It urged the school to eliminate regulations prohibiting meetings and to protect student groups from interference by government officials. A school official said the university permitted students to take part in activities `` as long as they were healthy and good for the students.'' But, <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Huajiang </PERSON>, a school spokesman, declined to define what type of activities those included. He said the university would take measures to stop `` unhealthy'' activities. He declined to comment on the poster. According to the poster, since the autumn semester, students have been meeting in `` democratic salons'' to discuss political topics. But recently school officials and authorities from the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> city government have broken up the meetings, it said.

 President <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said Tuesday he will uphold human rights and civil liberties, including freedom of expression. `` Dissent and criticism are no longer forbidden in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>,'' said the 65-year-old provisional president and army commander who toppled former President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in a Feb. 3 coup. `` The crucial role of a serious and honest press should not only be to secure democratic institutions but to project to the outside world the truth, even if it contains imperfections,'' he said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> it was reported the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rejected a request by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> for a temporary entrance visa. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> for 34 years, was given political asylum by <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and arrived there Feb. 5. Paraguayan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Argana </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> needs surgery for prostate cancer and the Paraguayan government asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to grant him a temporary visa for humanitarian reasons, but `` the answer was negative.'' <PERSON> Argana </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the Brazilian capital, for a diplomatic conference. After speaking to the press association, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> mingled with the nearly 200 editors and publishers at the luxurious Yacht and <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on the outskirts of the capital, <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. `` I would have liked him to be more emphatic in defense of freedom of the press, but it's good just to have a <LOCATION> Paraguayan </LOCATION> leader talking about it in general terms,'' said <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Uliberri </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacion </ORGANIZATION>. `` The general feeling in talking to the delegates is: so far, so good,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gripp </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> news service. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Neavoll </PERSON>, editorial page editor for the <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> -LRB- Kan. -RRB- Eagle-Beacon, said: `` The speech was hopeful,'' but `` it's still a period of wait-and-see.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> defended the coup that ended <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s regime, which was marked by confrontations with the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, economic setbacks, military shakeups, political repression and international isolation in its last months. `` It was a legitimate reaction to an intolerable state of affairs that was dangerously deteriorating the image of my country,'' he said. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was introduced by <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON>, editor of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Color, which was closed by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and allowed to reopen, along with <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nanduti </ORGANIZATION> and the political weekly <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Pueblo </PERSON>, after the coup. `` We are enjoying freedom but we will not let down our guard,'' Zuccolillo said. `` Freedom can become a permanent way of life in this country.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s candidate for president in May 1 national elections, which he is widely expected to win. <PERSON> Argana </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 76, must go to a country with advanced medical facilities and that he may go to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> is living in a beachfront mansion in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> resort town of <LOCATION> Guaratuba </LOCATION>, about 500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> initially said he planned to live in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> but recently expressed the desire to join his wife in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

 Country music star <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was banned from an arena after he cut a concert short and angry fans burned T-shirts and other souvenirs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> sang for only 40 minutes Sunday night at <ORGANIZATION> Viking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> to a crowd of 5,000 that paid $ 17.50 each for tickets. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 39, offered the audience no explanation when he suddenly walked off stage, said <PERSON> Terrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, director of the city-owned hall. Fans screamed and booed for nearly an hour after <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> jumped into a limousine for the airport. Members of the arena's board were in the audience and decided to ban any future performances by <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gangwisch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' publicist, said the performer was sick with a cold or the flu. `` He was n't feeling up to par, but he thought he could do the show and wanted to go on rather than face a postponement,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> did n't buy that explanation. `` He was obnoxious, but he was definitely not sick,'' she said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Elkins </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jockey </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said some fans burned souvenirs in protest. <PERSON> Elkins </PERSON> said he also saw <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> throw drumsticks and other objects at his band and staff members. `` It really bothers me that all these young kids look up to this man,'' he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, is known for such hits as `` Family Tradition,'' `` All My Rowdy Friends are Coming Over Tonight,'' and `` Born to <PERSON> Boogie </PERSON>.'' His current hit is `` A Tear in My Beer.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has invited anyone with a ticket stub to attend his April 14 show in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Gangwisch </PERSON> said.

 Protests and a memorial marked the anniversary of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s death Tuesday in the city where an assassin's bullet felled the civil rights leader 21 year ago. `` To commemorate any year of a life or death of our civil rights leaders is an event because Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> represents so much to so many people,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> chapter. `` -LRB- The anniversary -RRB- is a symbol of hope, a symbol of struggle and of unmet American commitment to equality in American society,'' he said. The day was a holiday for city sanitation workers, whose strike King had come to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> to support. The civil rights leader was shot by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> while standing on a balcony of The Lorraine motel. On Tuesday the Rev. <PERSON> Osagyefo </PERSON> <PERSON> Suhkara </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahweh </PERSON> led a midday march from the motel to the <ORGANIZATION> Clayborn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where a memorial service was held. Later, a `` Poor People's Campaign Rally'' was held in front of <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lorraine </LOCATION>, and anyone with a complaint was allowed to speak for up to two minutes. `` Some talk about human services, some talk about juvenile court,'' said the leader of the rally, <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> A.R </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ziyad </PERSON>. Most, he said, complained about the conversion of the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> into an $ 8.8 million civil rights museum. <PERSON> Ziyad </PERSON>'s group has filed a lawsuit in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> over the plans to demolish the motel and erect the museum in its place. The original plan `` was to convert it to a shrine to Dr. King instead of bringing in memorabilia from the gay rights struggle, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and all this other involvements that has nothing to do with Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ziyad </PERSON> said. Another memorial was attended by striking members of a municipal workers union, who then set up a picket line in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. Elsewhere, about 400 blacks marched through the streets of <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, to protest the city's refusal to declare <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s birthday a holiday. City officials say it would cost some $ 110,000 to give workers another paid day off. `` We ca n't help but feel that this is a form of racism,'' the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said at a City Hall rally.

 A civil rights group Tuesday filed a lawsuit accusing <ORGANIZATION> Shoney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> fast-food chain of restricting black employment and advancement. The class-action lawsuit was filed in federal court here by the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund. `` This is a case of national importance because the employer is a large and prominent corporation that employs a great number of people,'' said <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, director-counsel of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, organization. <PERSON> Shoney </PERSON>'s operates about 1,550 restaurants in 30 states, mainly in the Southeast, under the names <PERSON> Shoney </PERSON>'s, Captain D's and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Famous Recipe Chicken The complaint alleges that Nashville-based <ORGANIZATION> Shoney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> set a policy that limited the number of black employees in jobs with direct contact with patrons and failed to promote or hire black workers for managerial posts. <PERSON> Shoney </PERSON>'s also was accused of firing blacks and whites who complained about work conditions and dismissing blacks when their numbers at a restaurant exceeded 30 percent. <PERSON> Shoney </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> said the allegations `` do not reflect any policy or intent'' of the company. `` We intend to vigorously fight the suit and we expect to win,'' he said. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and an end to alleged discriminatory practices. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a lawyer working on the suit, said he believes it is one of the first racial discrimation cases with both black and white plaintiffs.

 A Dutch visitor on his way to an AIDS conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was held in a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> prison Tuesday because immigration authorities believe he has the disease. The detention of <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Verhoef </PERSON> prompted denunciations from AIDS activists and a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> congresswoman. But immigration officials said they were just following the law. `` We are holding Mr. <PERSON> Verhoef </PERSON> as an excludable alien because he has a dangerous and contagious disease,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiltgen </PERSON>, district director of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>. Verhoef, 31, of <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>, was apprehended at the Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Airport </PERSON> on Sunday by Customs officials who discovered the AIDS drug AZT in his baggage Verhoef, an AIDS prevention worker in his country, acknowledged to immigration officials that he has acquired immune deficiency syndrome. <PERSON> Schiltgen </PERSON> said tests would be conducted to verify Verhoef has the disease before authorities proceed with the case. The tests should be completed without a few days, he said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuddihy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> senior immigration examiner in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said 10 to 15 people with AIDS have been turned away at the border prior to the Verhoef case, and an unknown number have been denied visas in their native country. For years, immigration laws have required people who want to visit or move here to establish they have no dangerous, contagious diseases. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> added AIDS to that list of diseases in 1987. Verhoef can withdraw his application for admission to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and return to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> or appeal his exclusion to the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Schiltgen </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Verhoef </PERSON> tentatively had decided to appeal. <PERSON> Verhoef </PERSON> was transferred Tuesday from the Scott County Jail, where he was held since Sunday, to a medical facility at <ORGANIZATION> Stillwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schiltgen </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, D-Calif., asked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general to approve a waiver that would free Verhoef to complete his trip to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, a top aide to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, said late Tuesday that the request for a waiver had not yet reached <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s desk. `` We do not believe the intent behind the immigration law was to exclude tourists,'' said <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>. `` He did n't try to hide it,'' added <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>. `` We also question this on humanitarian grounds _ putting someone in jail under these circumstances.'' The detention also drew fire from AIDS activists in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Verhoef </PERSON> was to be a delegate to the International Caucus of the 7th National AIDS Forum and the 11th National Gay and Gay Health Conference. They were to begin on Wednesday. `` What everyone is concerned about is that this is really a very upsetting precedent because it impacts the freedom of people with -LRB- the AIDS virus -RRB- to travel,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, a spokesman for the AIDS conference. <PERSON> Bea </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said the conference is an important educational exchange for health care providers and educators worldwide in terms of AIDS prevention. She said the exclusion of someone with the disease `` is detrimental to international cooperation in the fight against AIDS.'' About 1,500 people are expected to attend the conference.

 His nickname in high school was `` Mayor'' and his traffic ticket on a trip home from college made front-page news. Few men are to the manor born, but <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, almost everyone said, was born to be mayor. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> realized that destiny when he was elected to the office his father held for 21 years. Throughout a political career that had its beginnings nearly 30 years ago, the <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> name made many of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON>'s achievements possible, diminished others, and left him forever open to the charge that his vision extends only as far as his father's shadow. He lived at home until he was 30, and now, at age 46, still lives only a few blocks from the bungalow where he grew up in the working-class <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> neighborhood. He looks, walks, talks, and occasionally misspeaks in a way that makes him unmistakeably the son of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the late six-term <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mayor and big-city boss. `` He even began to look more like his father in recent weeks,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor. `` He was chunkier, more confident, he gave the same monosyllabic answers with a lot of common sense in them.'' The most frequent criticism of the younger <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> is that he has the same politics as his father and will revive the <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> `` Machine.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, author of `` Himself,'' a biography of the elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, said he did n't think that was true. `` For one thing, a ` Machine' like the old man's is a political dinosaur that will never again roam the earth,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, also noting <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s unsuccessful 1983 mayoral bid chastened him. The eldest son of seven children, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> cut his political teeth working as an 18-year-old page for the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> delegation to the 1960 Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> graduated from law school in 1968. His father rewarded him with a job as an assistant corporation counsel after he passed the bar exam on his third try. The elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> also slated his son for a seat in the Illinois Constitutional Convention. Then, in 1972, his father sent old <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> machine warhorse <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nihill </PERSON> packing and virtually handed <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> his seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The younger <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was criticized in his early years, called little more `` his father's eyes and ears,'' and `` dirty little <PERSON> Richie </PERSON>'' by one colleague for using his chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to routinely squash good-government legislation. But many of those same colleagues recalled how two events changed him irrevocably. The first came on Dec. 20, 1976, when his father died months into a sixth term. A year and a half later, his third child, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, was born with the crippling disease spina bifida. `` After Dad died, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> looked at himself for the first time without Dad looking over his shoulder,'' recalled <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, his chief political strategist and the youngest of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>.'s seven children. The strain of <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>'s illness may have an equally profound impact on his life. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> began taking a leadership role in such legislative issues as nursing homes and abolishing taxes on some foods and medicine. He showed a political acumen few thought him capable of, and forged cautious alliances with the same reformers who often had opposed his father. As a result, when he ran for the first of his three terms as <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney in 1980, Democrats slated <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> to run against him. The younger <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> clobbered <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, then twice won re-election.

 Friends and supporters of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Heirens </PERSON> on Tuesday pleaded for the release of the man sent to prison in 1946 for committing three sensational murders and scrawling on the wall, `` Catch me before I kill more.'' Supporters told the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Heirens </PERSON>, who has been denied parole 28 times, is the very model of a rehabilitated prisoner. But the brother and sister of one of his victims, 6-year-old <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Degnan </PERSON>, argued that <PERSON> Heirens </PERSON>, 60, would be a threat if freed under executive clemency, and a prosecutor said <PERSON> Heirens </PERSON> is a `` secret killer.'' `` I just fear for children,'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, sister of <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON>, said after the hearing. `` I do n't want another family to go through this again.'' A lawyer for the parole board, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinkamp </PERSON>, said members will send their clemency recommendation soon to Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who will make the final determination. <PERSON> Heirens </PERSON> was a 17-year-old <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> freshman when he was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences. He pleaded guilty to three murders and 25 burglaries. The dismemberment of the <PERSON> Degnan </PERSON> child followed the slayings of two women, one stabbed, the other shot and stabbed. At one victim's apartment, <PERSON> Heirens </PERSON> scrawled on a wall in lipstick, `` For heaven's sake, catch me before I kill I can not control myself.'' Among the supporters urging <PERSON> Heirens </PERSON>' release was lawyer <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Heirens </PERSON> had gone from `` the depths of human dispair'' to become the first <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> prisoner to earn a college degree behind bars. <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> and other supporters described <PERSON> Heirens </PERSON> as a sensitive man, always willing to help fellow prisoners. He argued that <PERSON> Heirens </PERSON> should be released to show other inmates that there is hope through rehabilitation. `` If we claim to be a civilized society, than perpetual incarceration of anyone is antithetical to our society,'' said <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McNerney </PERSON> said <PERSON> Heirens </PERSON>'s supporters fail to see `` the nature of this man's problem. Outside prison, he said, <PERSON> Heiren </PERSON> would be a danger. `` He's a secret killer,'' <PERSON> McNerney </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday killed Bullfrog County, pop. 0. The county, formed in an attempt to prevent the federal government from putting a nuclear waste dump there, was ruled unconstitutional last year by the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. It's `` not that I loved Bullfrog less, but that I loved <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> more,'' Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> said in a eulogy that borrowed from <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>.'' `` As he was valiant, I honor him; But as he was ambitious they slew him.'' <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> was a key sponsor of the bill that carved the 144-square-mile <LOCATION> Bullfrog </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Nye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1987. <LOCATION> Bullfrog </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> had no population, no roads and surrounded <ORGANIZATION> Yucca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION>, which the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> is studying as the possible site for a high-level nuclear waste dump. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and other state officials strongly oppose the dump, and the desert county was formed solely to collect millions of dollars from the government by imposing the highest property tax rate allowed under the state constitution. But <LOCATION> Nye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sued the state, contending it was entitled to any money collected, and a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice ruled that <LOCATION> Bullfrog </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was unconstitutional because, among other reasons, it lacked a representative government.

 Police said Tuesday they held three people for questioning in connection with a cache of arms, explosives and documents found in a <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> attic. Police said the apartment was believed to be the abandoned hideout of leftist terrorists. In the attic police found three pistols, a rifle, a hand-grenade, three dynamite sticks, ammunition, two radio-receivers, bullet-proof vests, material for counterfeiting documents, and documents related to two different terrorist groups _ the Red Brigades and Organized Communists for Proletarian Liberation. Police said the hideout was probably abandoned in January after officers arrested eight reputed members of the gang following a bank holdup. The cache was discovered by the apartment owner, who went to the building because the tenants had not paid rent for months.

<TEXT>
 Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said Tuesday he sees no way to stop the violence on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> that has taken more than 400 lives since Palestinian Arabs began their revolt against Israeli control nearly 16 months ago. After meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> for two hours, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said that `` if anybody could stop it, we would be very pleased,'' then asked, `` But how?'' The Egyptian leader, nearing the end of two days of talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials, made no public demands on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He said he was simply `` trying to find out what's the best way to achieve peace'' through negotiations <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> stood aside, and in his only statement to reporters said `` it is important that we try and create a climate that can move us toward those negotiations and try and improve the atmosphere on the ground.'' The next step in the search is a visit beginning Wednesday by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. He is expected to outline to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> a plan for holding elections among the 1.2 million Palestinians who live in the territories won from the Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day War. The idea behind <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal is to have Palestinians choose leaders to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, who has insisted that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> deal instead with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, withheld judgment on <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal He said the criterion should be whether an election would help advance the peace process. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters later at the White House, said, `` We want to listen to what Prime Minister <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has to say about how the peace process can be moved forward.'' While <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> disclosed his proposal last week in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he has withheld details until he sees <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, whose identity could not be used under White House rules, called the situation on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> untenable but declined to say whether the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration held the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accountable. `` I am not going to get into the causes ... and who is in control,'' he said. The Palestinian rebellion, which <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say was inspired and is maintained by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, began in December 1987 and has had the effect of enhancing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest in the situation on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Since the rebellion began, 418 Palestinian Arabs and 18 Israelis have died. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, in response to a question, told reporters `` neither you nor anybody else would be able to stop the intefadeh -LRB- uprising in Arabic -RRB-. ... Let us be realistic and practical. We all hope that we could reach peace and avoid losing lives and spending money for killing and bloodshed. ...'' Earlier, in an appeal for additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told 15 senators that his nation had adopted economic reforms and needs a continued high level of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> described the 90-minute private meeting as `` very beneficial and fruitful'' but said commitments on the aid issue were neither sought nor given. Both <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said senators told the Egyptian president that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must keep the large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit in mind in dealing with all requests for economic and military assistance. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said senators appeared favorably impressed with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s description of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s economic reform program, including the reduction of subsidies on a number of consumer products and revisions in the country's tax structure. `` The president argued that the pace he is pursuing is the one most appropriate to their circumstances and the one most likely to bring success,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. The Egyptian leader is hoping that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will approve new weapons sales once they are formally proposed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and that $ 230 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid will be released. The aid was withheld in March pending reforms in the way <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> manages its economy which that country must have in place by June. Meanwhile, 200 American Jews said in a statement released by Tikkum magazine in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that they challenged <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s policies and urged him to begin negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` Many American Jews, loyal supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, do not support the suppression of the Palestinian people and the continued occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. `` You do not have a blank check from American Jewry to continue these policies.'' Tikkum is a bimonthly magazine that concentrates on political and cultural issues of special interest to American Jews. The signers included the comedian and writer <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, novelist <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, playwright <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and civil rights lawyer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Raugh </PERSON>. `` Begin negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' the statement said. `` Not only has the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> begun to talk to talk with them but recent polls indicate that 58 percent of American Jews would support direct negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. `` If you are serious about seeking peace, you must be prepared to talk directly with your enemies, and you can not expect to pick their representatives for them.'' In a toast at a White House dinner honoring <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said called his two days of meetings with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> `` productive, a time for seeking common ground in approaching the peace process as well as a good time to discuss the bilateral issues.'' `` I firmly believe that peace will prevail if we continue to work with a common purpose in the spirit of teamwork,'' he said. `` We must work to create a new atmosphere for Palestinians and Israelis to put aside violence in favor of words. A dialogue for peace for peace is the best way to establish <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security and give the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> their legitimate political rights.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, in his toast, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidency ushers `` a new era of our freindship and cooperation,'' and called the president `` a great friend of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.'' `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have chosen you as the torch bearer at a unique and critical juncture,'' he said. `` Together we have an opportunity to make the middle east a much safer and more stable place.''

<HEAD>Court OKs Trial For DES Lawsuits Filed Under `Toxic Tort' Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s highest court Tuesday cleared the way for trial of billions of dollars in lawsuits filed over DES, which has been blamed for cancer and sterility in women whose mothers took the anti-miscarriage drug. The Court of Appeals also determined that all companies that made the drug should be liable for any DES damage awards won by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> residents _ even if those companies never marketed their pills in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayesh </PERSON>, a lawyer for the pharmaceutical company <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling makes <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the only state to say all DES manufacturers are liable for some damages. The court upheld <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 1986 `` toxic torts'' law, which covers purported victims of five chemicals and permits them to sue within three years after effects of the exposure are discovered. Prior to the law, victims were required to sue within three years of actual exposure to a toxic substance. The new law also gave those barred from suing under the old law a one-year period in which to sue. Tuesday's ruling was praised by women who claim they were harmed by the DES their mothers took between the late 1940s and early 1970s. The drug was marketed until 1971. In virtually every DES case, victims had been barred from suing because the health problems did n't appear for many years after the usual state statute of limitations had expired. However, <PERSON> Mayesh </PERSON> cautioned that the ruling only opens the way for juries to hear claims that people were harmed by exposure to DES. `` The issues decided here are procedural only,'' said <PERSON> Mayesh </PERSON>. `` They do not address the fundamental question of whether DES caused any of the health problems the plaintiffs claim it did. That issue remains very hotly contested.'' But in his ruling, Chief Judge <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtler </PERSON> said there is `` strong evidence'' linking DES exposure to `` later development of serious medical problems.'' More than 500 DES lawsuits seeking some $ 3 billion in damages were filed during the `` window'' created by the toxic tort law. In addition to diethylstilbestrol, or DES, the substances covered by the law are asbestos, tungsten-carbide, chlordane and polyvinylchloride. In <PERSON> Wachtler </PERSON>'s ruling, the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected drug companies' arguments that the law violates their rights to due process and equal protection. A stickier legal question for the court, apparently, was how to determine which drug companies are responsible for the damages and how much they should pay. The court decided unanimously that a `` market share theory,'' similar to one first formulated by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s top court, will be adopted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for apportioning damages from the DES litigation. That means drug companies in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court cases will be liable for a percentage of damages corresponding to the percentage of the national DES market they controlled while manufacturing the drug.

 The Ethics committee on Tuesday interviewed two men involved in a real estate deal with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> amid reports that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> may have accepted $ 100,000 in unreported gifts from one of them. The committee planned to resume its closed-door deliberations on a long list of possible rules violations by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Wednesday, and a final outcome of the case still appeared to be more than a week away. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the committee is considering whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated rules by accepting use of a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> condominium, a 1979 Cadillac and a salary paid to his wife from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, a longtime friend and business partner of the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION>. House rules prohibit the acceptance of gifts of more than $ 100 from `` any person ... having a direct interest in legislation.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has steadfastly denied violating House rules. But in a new variation on the denial, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the speaker, said Tuesday that if the committee finds any rules infractions, they would only be `` technical'' and not `` intentional.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, in its Wednesday editions, said the ethics panel has concluded that several of the charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> should be dropped. Those include <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s intervention with federal banking regulators on behalf of hard-pressed <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institutions, his intercession with government officials on behalf of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil and gas company, and his use of a government-paid staff aide to compile parts of a book. Committee members met privately Tuesday with <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Swann </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to question them about an investment <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made in `` Winderwood,'' a housing development undertaken by <PERSON> Swann </PERSON> and others beginning in 1985. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made roughly $ 50,000 on the deal. `` We're fine-tuning what we already knew,'' said committee member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, R-Ind. The committee apparently is exploring whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> or <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had direct financial interests in the health of the savings and loan industry at a time when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was lobbying federal regulators to be more lenient with ailing S & amp; Ls. One issue is whether a $ 2.2 million loan made to <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s sons _ a loan <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> co-signed _ by a troubled savings and loan to develop a shopping center gave the developer an interest in legislation calling for `` forbearance'' toward S & amp; Ls by federal regulators. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Tuesday denied any knowledge of the loan or a federal lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Mallicks </ORGANIZATION> to recover $ 1 million lost after the loan was foreclosed. `` To say that I favored forbearance because of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> is ludicrous,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. He noted that other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lawmakers had fought for the same provision in the law `` because the economy of our state was in crisis and our constituents were feeling the need for help.'' The ethics committee has been investigating <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s finances since last June and has spent some $ 1 million on a probe by its outside counsel in the case, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>. During depositions taken from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> last year, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> was highly skeptical of benefits received by the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> from their partnership with <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>. That included the condominium which <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> made available to the <ORGANIZATION> Wrights </ORGANIZATION> for a token fee, the use of the car, and Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s $ 18,000-a-year salary. Investigators `` doubted what she had done'' in return for the salary, said one source familiar with the case. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> denied that the salary of his wife <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> was a gift. `` She performed work for the pay she received,'' he said in answer to a reporter's question. The Journal said the panel has discussed a total value for the benefits from Mallightco of $ 100,000, and said <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> views the benefits as unreported gifts. <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and his sons, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, held a $ 2.2 million loan from <ORGANIZATION> Interwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> that was used to develop a shopping center. The Mallicks defaulted on the loan in 1987, plus $ 100,000 in unpaid interest, and are being sued for the $ 1 million that remained uncollected after the project was sold. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Tuesday called <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> a longtime friend and said the developer had never asked him to vote for or against any legislation. `` He has never asked me for official assistance in any way, shape or form,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters, adding that he had no knowledge of <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s loan or the lawsuit until asked about it by a reporter on Monday. In pretrial testimony last year, the senior <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> testified that federal regulators were partly to blame for his problems with the loan because they were pressuring S & amp; Ls to foreclose on troubled loans rather than extending additional credit and working with borrowers to rescue investments. `` Many of the institutions were under the supervision of the regulators,'' <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> said in a deposition taken by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Interwest </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was an atmosphere that existed, to where in earlier days if you had problems like this, you were able to have the flexibility to work them out. Because of this particular time in our industry, that flexibility was n't allowed, because of the problems of the lenders themselves. They were n't able to be flexible with their borrowers in order to maneuver and work things out.'' <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> organized a 1986 meeting at which area developers and lenders complained to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> about the heavy-handedness of regulators, and prepared a long report on the subject at <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s request At the time, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also was lobbying colleagues to pass legislative language requiring that regulators show `` forbearance'' to troubled S & amp; Ls, even taking the unusual step of convening Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to plead for such language in a bill recapitalizing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Journal reported.

 `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'' is doing its first musical mystery on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> this Sunday, but do n't look for <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> to sing and dance his way into your heart. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, in a guest appearance as a fading movie star looking for a comeback in a Broadway-bound play, handles that chore. The two-hour movie, `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>: The Case of the Musical Murder,'' also stars <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> as the intrepid lawyer, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Della </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> as his new investigators, and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>. It was filmed on location in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Reynolds performs as <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>, whose play is suddenly derailed when the promising young stage manager is accused of murdering the director. In the play, called `` Polly,'' she's a bawdy house madam and sings two songs, `` Polly'' and `` Madam,'' written by the show's musical director, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Debenedictis </PERSON>. `` We did the musical in a lovely theater in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> had gotten permission for us to use,'' said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. `` Polly's like a <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> She runs a house of ill repute. That gives it a little color, since it's not my image to play a madam. There are n't many good scripts for a woman my age `` I like to play characters. <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> is the sort of lady who's vain She's a star, but she does n't want to admit she's old enough to have a son. The young stage manager is really her son but she keeps passing him off as her friend. She's like <PERSON> Gypsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. You never knew she had a son until she died.'' She said it was her first time to work with <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, who was an established character actor when she began as a musical comedy star at <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>. She was in such movies as `` Singin' in the Rain,'' `` <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> and the Bachelor,'' `` How the West Was Won'' and `` The Unsinkable <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> was interviewed at her dance studio in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, where she was rehearsing `` The Unsinkable <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'' before taking it on the road. Although she starred in the movie, she has never done it as a play. She opens April 20 in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harve </PERSON> <PERSON> Presnell </PERSON>, who co-starred on Broadway with <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>, will appear with <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. `` I do n't want to book the play into <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> until it's proven,'' she said. She was also due to fly to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to promote her autobiography, `` <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> _ My Life,'' which is just coming out in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The book is now in its second printing in this country. She is married to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a real estate developer who helps manage her business affairs. `` I keep saying I'm going to cut back, but I'm doing more now than I did when I was 20,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. `` I think I'm caught on the cowcatcher. I ca n't get off. I still work in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>.'' The `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'' appearance is her first time on TV in about a year. The last thing she did was a movie called `` <PERSON> Sadie </PERSON> and Son,'' about a policewoman and her son. She said it was probably intended as a pilot but she refused to sign a series agreement. `` I prefer to do theater,'' she said. `` The roles are better. I do n't want to compromise at my age and I do n't want to go out doing scripts I hate. I have to travel a lot, but I prefer that. You have a choice. I'd teach before I'd do bad scripts.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> made two attempts at TV series, `` The Debbie Reynolds Show'' about 20 years ago and `` Aloha Paradise'' in 1981. Both shows were unsuccessful. She has owned the dance rehearsal hall about 10 years. The hall, decorated with old movie posters and theater memorabilia, is a favorite place for dancers to work out. Her last feature film was `` What's the Matter with <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>?'' about 18 years ago. Her daughter, <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, is very active in feature films, most notably in the `` Star Wars'' films.

<HEAD>Marlee Matlin Makes Speaking Debut in TV Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Academy Award-winning actress <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON> makes her speaking debut on Sunday in `` Bridge to Silence'' on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>, who is deaf, won an Oscar for her starring role opposite <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> in the film version of the play `` Children of a Lesser God.'' In that movie, and in a subsequent small role in the film `` <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>,'' she played a deaf woman who communicated with sign language. `` Bridge to Silence,'' co-starring <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Remick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON>, is a complex emotional drama that gives full range to <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>'s considerable acting talent. Her speech is clear and definite. Her character uses both spoken word and sign language. <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, a deaf woman whose husband, also deaf and a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, is killed in a car accident. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> is left seriously injured and unable temporarily to care for her young daughter, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Remick </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Marge </PERSON>, a perfectionist who can not accept her daughter's disability, to the point of refusing to learn sign language. <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> takes <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>'s injury as an opportunity to appropriate perfect, hearing <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, as her own. <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>'s father, who is sympathetic to his daughter and disapproves of his wife's manipulation. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Great Santini'' -RRB- plays <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, a long-time friend and director at the Theatre for the Deaf in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> had met her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON>. After <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s death, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> withdraws in grief. In a confrontation with <PERSON> Marge </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> shouts at one point, `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> loved me for what I am! You never did!'' Much of the movie's plot is made up of melodramatic devices. Basically, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> hauls <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in hopes that getting her back into acting will release her from her pain. Of course, the climax will be when <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> finally accepts her daughter and comes, for the first time, to see her perform. The play that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> casts <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> in is `` The Glass Menagerie.'' <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Frelich </PERSON>, who played the same role as <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON> in the stage version of `` Children of a Lesser God'' and won a <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, plays an actress who appears in the play with <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frelich </PERSON> recently launched a protest campaign against the CBS series `` The Equalizer,'' complaining that a hearing actress was hired to play a deaf woman in an episode. The movie tends to stretch an already meager plot even thinner by such devices as having <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> develop a high fever, the symptom that years earlier portended spinal meningitis in <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> and cost her her hearing. Still, it's worth it just to see the performances of Remick and <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>. These two can lift the most predictable scene to a level of high art. The capable direction by <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> also helps. But there are some nicely written scenes, too, such as the one where the deaf actors sit around the dining table and toast absent <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s birthday, singing an ebullient `` Happy Birthday To You'' out-loud and in sign language at the same time. Then they tell anecdotes of childhood, poignantly recalling the difficulties of public schools and hearing pupils and parents who were hard to please. Of course, we know <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> will eventually triumph and <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> will see the error of her ways. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>'s climactic speech to her mother will no doubt be applauded by every deaf person who's ever contended with the ignorance of the hearing world: `` I learned to speak for you, but you never learned to sign for me. I'm deaf, but you're the one who ca n't hear.''

<HEAD>Despite High Prices, Homebuyers Want More Amenities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 Inflation is n't the only reason for the big price tags on new houses in recent years. Comfort and prestige on a luxurious scale probably count as much, judging from a <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> report. Data from the report show that much of the new-home construction market has gone upscale to a surprising extent at the very time, oddly, that pressure is growing for more affordable housing for young families. The situation poses a dilemma for housing markets: How can existing owners continue to move up to more expensive housing if first-time buyers can not afford to buy the houses the more affluent owners are leaving? Most of the demand for luxurious accommodations comes from existing owners who, benefiting from rising market values in the past few years, have amassed mountains of equity that can be applied to fulfilling their housing dreams. Eventually, some housing people predict, the trend to more expensive housing could automatically abort because of weakness in the lower end of the market, leaving a dearth of the move-up buyers with sufficient equity. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> report shows that in 1988 the median size of new homes was 1,815 square feet, compared with 1,605 square feet in 1984. More revealing are the amenities: 42 percent with more than two baths, compared with just 28 percent in 1984; 26 percent with four bedrooms or more versus 18 percent in 1984; and 75 percent with central air, versus 71 percent. The proportion with more than one fireplace also rose, to 65 percent from 59 percent, as did the proportion with garages able to accommodate more than two cars, 65 percent against 55 percent. A separate survey of homeowner preferences by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> confirms that consumers seeking another home look for more room and more amenities, and that they wo n't accept stripped-down houses. At one time, basic houses were viewed by government and industry officials as a practical means of providing shelter at relatively low prices, while providing the owner the option of adding space when finances permitted. Analyzing the figures, a Home Builder economist attributes at least part of the luxury phenomenon to demographics, especially an aging of the population, and income trends, or `` a greater inequality in the distribution of income.'' A more economical approach to housing, and perhaps more in balance with an aging population, could be detected in figures for multifamily housing, which includes many rental units. Those figures, from the same <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> report, show the median size of new units in 1988 was 935 square feet compared with 871 square feet in 1984. Units with two baths or more rose to 41 percent from 35 percent. However, economic or demographic pressure was revealed in some of the other multifamily figures: The percentage with two bedrooms rose only 1 percentage point, from 54 to 55, between 1984 and 1988. Units with three or more bedrooms dropped to 8 percent from 9 percent. Moreover, the percentage of units constructed with air conditioning fell to 84 percent from 89 percent. While these multifamily figures do suggest some leveling in the demand for luxuries, they also remain extraordinarily high when matched against some of the data from another <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> study, this one in 1940. In that census, the median value of owner-occupied homes was $ 2,938. Thirty-one percent of existing homes had no running water, 45 percent lacked complete private plumbing, and fewer than half had central heat.

<HEAD>Ancient Profession of Snake Charming is Dying in India</HEAD>

 In the land where it was born, the ancient art of snake charming is dying and its half million practioners are vanishing. Hunger haunts them. Police chase them. Ecologists despise them. People on the street no longer care for them. `` Snake charming is no more a paying profession,'' said 90-year-old <PERSON> Sunder </PERSON> <PERSON> Nath </PERSON>. `` Our children are not interested in snake charming any more. There is not enough money, not enough charm left. `` Our children want to become clerks, bus drivers, even policemen, but not snake charmers.'' Although he walks with the aid of a stick, <PERSON> Nath </PERSON> still holds road side shows. The guru and saint of snake charmers is <PERSON> Gorak </PERSON> <PERSON> Nath </PERSON>, who they say lived 500 years ago, and all snake charmers take his last name. <LOCATION> Molarband </LOCATION>, about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, is one of the two villages in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exclusively inhabited by snake charmers. The other village is in the state of <LOCATION> Orissa </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. About 1,500 snake charmers live in <LOCATION> Molarband </LOCATION> in mud-and-stone homes. Each home has 10 to 15 snakes. `` Gone are the days when our children lived with snakes, grew with snakes,'' said <PERSON> Prabhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nath </PERSON>, 50, whose two children attend a government-run school not far from <LOCATION> Mokarband </LOCATION>. `` Now they are going to schools to learn English.'' `` When I grow up I would like to become bus driver,'' said 15-year-old <PERSON> Rajpal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nath </PERSON>, a ninth grader. `` My friends tell me that snake charming is nothing but another form of begging. I do n't want to be called a beggar.'' `` There is no value in our father's work. We are looked down by everyone,'' added 14-year-old <PERSON> Rameshchand </PERSON> <PERSON> Nath </PERSON>, who wants to be a bank clerk. About 250 of the 1,500 students at the school near <LOCATION> Molarband </LOCATION> are from families of snake charmers. `` This is remarkable,'' said <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON> <PERSON> Longia </PERSON>, the school's headmaster `` Ten years back, we hardly had any student from the snake charmers' families.'' Experts say the ranks of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 500,000 snake charmers are declining fast. `` There are no new charmers joining the clan. What we have is the old stock,'' said <PERSON> Komolesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Dev </PERSON>, who has spent months in <LOCATION> Molarband </LOCATION> studying the life of the snake charmer. `` There was a time when snake charmers were part of Indian life, they provided the best and cheapest entertainment. `` But today who cares for them? They are remembered only once a year during the snake festival.'' Every year on `` Nag Panchimi,'' or Snake God festival day, Hindus pray to snakes and feed them. The brave among them wear snakes around their necks and some even pose with them for photographs. Women make snake beds in their homes and pray to snakes to give them sons. `` Only on that day we are in great demand,'' said <PERSON> Sambhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nath </PERSON>. `` We offer our snakes for hire and make good money. But it is only one day of bright sunshine in a year.'' A team of two snake charmers on the average makes about 75 rupees -LRB- $ 5 -RRB- a day. `` From this amount we bribe the police, feed our snakes and run our families,'' <PERSON> Sambhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nath </PERSON> said. But there is no business during monsoon season and parts of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s blistering summer. The Indian Wildlife Act prohibits the possession, sale or purchase of about 30 of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 240 species of reptiles, and the ban includes the King Cobra, the most prized possession of a snake charmer. `` You ca n't hold a show with rat snake,'' <PERSON> Prakash </PERSON> <PERSON> Nath </PERSON> said. `` It ought to be a King Cobra or at least a cobra. ... Only then people are interested. `` First, it is difficult to find a cobra because forests are vanishing and when we find one, we ca n't keep it forever as it is against our tradition.'' When a snake charmer decides catches a snake, he performs a rite and pledges to release it within a year.

 <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON> remembers that on a Sunday morning in July 1948 an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier came to the door and told his mother the family would have to leave the house and go to the center of town. <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON>'s father <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a soapmaker and landowner, locked the front door of the four-room stone house, put the keys in his pocket and started walking. He thought he would be home in time for dinner. But their footsteps on the dusty road took them into the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diaspora </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON>'s parents did not return to live in <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION>. They were among the 600,000 to 760,000 Arabs who left towns and villages in what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during the first <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> war, according to <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> historian who has studied the Palestinian refugee problem. The 1948 war started when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> declared its independence and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries attacked the new nation. There was no state that belonged to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, and many Palestinians who lived in the area that is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> left on the advice of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders or to escape the war zone. Arabs who identify themselves as Palestinians now number roughly 4.7 million. About half of the Palestinians live in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, in the Israeli-annexed section of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> or inside the borders of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. About 766,000 still live in refugee camps. The rest are scattered. A 15-month Palestinian uprising that began in December 1987 in the Israeli-occupied territories and a decision by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to talk with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> have made the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and their future a main element of the quest for peace. Because Palestinians living abroad seek the right to return to their homes, most of which were long ago destroyed or belong to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> families, the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diaspora </LOCATION> poses one of the thorniest peacemaking problems. Israeli politicians of the right and left are united in opposing the return of Palestinians to what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and many Israelis are concerned about an influx of former guerrillas and improverished camp dwellers to a Palestinian state created from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> can be, and has been, a Kuwaiti, a Jordanian, a Syrian, an American, a European. But he never, under any circumstances, gave up that identification of being a Palestinian,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> for the Study of International Affairs in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. For <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON>, then 11, his three younger brothers and two sisters, leaving their home meant joining a stream of thousands of other Palestinians uprooted from <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ramle </LOCATION> on July 12-14, 1948. `` We did n't realize what was happening until we were out of town. We had n't taken anything with us, no money, no papers, no clothes. Nobody thought we were being evicted for good,'' said <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON>, who is now an Episcopal pastor and political activist in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. According to Israeli historical accounts, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers cleared the towns to secure the strategic highway linking <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and the besieged city of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> during the battle for independence. The <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON> house later was rented by the Israeli government to a Jewish family who immigrated from <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and was recently torn down to make way for modern apartments. In one of history's ironies, a Palestinian family had begun a Diaspora and a Jewish family had returned from the Diaspora Other <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON> family members owned land at <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> where jet airliners now take off and land at <LOCATION> Ben-Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Like other refugees, the Rantisis dispersed throughout the world, first driven by war to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and later seeking respite abroad from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation or in search of better opportunities for jobs and education. <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON> and his two sisters stayed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in 1967. But his three brothers moved to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON>, 48, works for a candy company, <PERSON> Mahfouz </PERSON>, 41, is an architect and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, 46, is a cabinet maker who first went to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> after working in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, 20, is studying biology at a college in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>, 16, goes to a girls' preparatory school in <LOCATION> Bucknell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Two cousins, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isa </PERSON>, are goldsmiths in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, where they fled after their <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> shop was ruined in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war Cousin <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> still runs a grocery in the embattled Lebanese capital of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and cousin <PERSON> Hany </PERSON> operates the traditional family soapmaking business in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Other relatives live in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> own the Uptown Restaurant. The only branch of the family to remain in <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION>, where only 8,000 of the 41,000 residents are <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, is headed by <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> `` Abu Isa'' <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON>, 86. Over a cup of coffee laced with cognac, he said the <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON> family had lived in <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> since coming from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> hundreds of years ago. About 20 percent of Palestinians are Christians and most of the Rantisis are Greek Orthodox. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> watched his grandchildren play with Israelis in the streets of the mixed neighborhood and said he was resigned to living as part of a minority in a Jewish state.

<TEXT>
 Do the Rantisis expect to return to Lod? Are they willing to compromise and settle for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state limited to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>? Would they return if a state was created? The answers are varied in the <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON> family as they are among Palestinians as a whole. But there is a shared, strong sense of national identity, enhanced by pride in the success of the intefadeh, the Palestinian uprising in Israeli occupied lands. Sitting on a cardboard box and sipping tea in his grocery store near the Wehdat refugee camp in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> <PERSON> Samaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON>, 44, recalled that he had grown up with stories about massacres and expulsions and learned to hate Israelis. `` Now I have become older and have more learning. We can not throw the Israelis in the sea. We want that we live and they live, and to give both peoples a right to coexist,'' said <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> <PERSON> Samaan </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Randa </PERSON> <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON>, 30, is a teacher whose students are active participants in the 15-month Palestinian revolt. She said a mini-state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was not enough. `` I want to go back and live where my parents lived before. If <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> wants only the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, maybe others like -LRB- guerrrilla leader -RRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> will continue fighting for the rest of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>,'' she said. <PERSON> Randa </PERSON>'s older brother <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> was more concerned about the loss of business during the uprising than about the political future. He is nonetheless indignant at the three times soldiers forced their way into his house looking for stone throwers and at being ordered on another occasion to clear a street of burning tires and barricades. <PERSON> Hoda </PERSON>, 60, mother of <PERSON> Randa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, recalls proudly that her cousin, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, helped carry her daughter during the long trek out of <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> in July 1948. `` He looked very sad and was saying over and over, ` God is with us and he will help us.''' <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, a pediatrician, went on to become leader of the radical Marxist Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, and is now a leading opponent of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism and recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON>, 52, said the two-day forced march from <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was a bitter experience that left deep psychological wounds. The experience helped propel <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON> into politics. He was elected deputy mayor of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> in 1976 but deposed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities in 1982 for refusing to cooperate with the army's newly created civil administration. <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON>, a thin, intense, scholarly looking man who wears a black frock and white collar, said the `` psychological healing process'' will take many years, but that he is ready to turn the other cheek and make peace. `` I do not have hatred in my heart ... I am ready to forgive, but not to forget my rights. God is a God of justice and righteousness,'' said <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON> has no desire to move back to <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION>, saying his life now revolves around his ministry and a private school he runs in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. But he said statehood would bring back his brothers from overseas and reunite the family. Would his family return? <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> 20 years ago `` seeking a better life,'' said he was ready to give up his suburban home near <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, and take his wife and two children to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> the instant a state was created. This sense of nationalism is reflected by his 14-year-old daughter <PERSON> Madelane </PERSON>, who seems far more likely than her father to realize such a dream. `` I do n't say I'm a Canadian. I say I'm a Palestinian if anyone asks,'' she told a reporter. But most of the <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON> family living abroad gave uncertain answers about whether they would risk uprooting their families. `` It's not easy to leave,'' said <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, 40, who owns the Uptown Restaurant with his brother <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 30, in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>. Memories of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> are romantic: sweet plum and almond trees, soft breezes and a slower pace of life. `` It's a happy life without the complications. ... Here there's too much to worry about _ money, bills etc.'' said <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>'s gold market, leaning over a counter filled with earrings and pendants, <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON> recalled that he visited his birthplace in 1967 and found a Jewish family from <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> in the house. When he went inside the house, `` I remembered everything, it was like a photograph.'' <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> said he did not blame the Israeli family who rented the house, but said he could not give up his right to return and reclaim what belonged to his family. `` How could we give it up?'' he asked. `` If I do n't get it back, my son will.''

 <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON> have built a life in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but their hearts and minds often are in a faraway land, where they knew the joy of being united with family and the pain of seeing their world torn apart. Today, the Palestinian brothers are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, grateful for freedom and success in their adopted country, but worried about and longing for the simple, yet turbulent, homeland they left behind. `` It's impossible to forget your language, your home and your people,'' said <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, 40, who with his younger brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> owns a restaurant in this industrial city. `` I am willing to be a good citizen of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- there is no way you can forget your homeland. When you grow up in a place, you learn to love that place.'' `` I remember my friends,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON>, smoking a cigarette as he and his brother sat in a booth in their restaurant. `` It's my home. It's inside of me.'' From a cramped single room they shared in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, the 11 children born to <PERSON> Sulieman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON> have migrated to all corners of the world _ <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Three are in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> with their mother. <PERSON> Sulieman </PERSON> died in 1974. Two brothers, <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON>, remain in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. Their cousin, <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON>, an Episcopal priest also lives there. A sister, <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON>, lives in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The family keeps in contact with letters and phone calls. The <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON> brothers, who are Christians, grew up with the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Shortly after <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers forced most Palestinians out of <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s war of independence in 1948, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> was born in a cold cement room in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> without doctors or nurses. In the following decades, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> conquered the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the family lived with the turmoil of tanks in the streets, fear of bombings and worries about eviction. But the brothers, who built furniture in a small shop, also have fond memories of sweet plum and almond trees, soft breezes and a slower pace. `` It's a happy life without the complications like here,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. `` Over here, there's too much to worry about _ money, bills. ...'' In 1976, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>, came to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. His in-laws lived there and husband and wife began working in factories. `` We thought we could have a better opportunity here,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- There -RRB- the economic situation was very bad.'' There were other motivations. `` You're not free there,'' he added. `` If there's a demonstration or a bomb, it makes everybody fear they're going to be arrested. ... There is no peace.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 30, a bachelor, followed in 1979 and also worked in a factory. They saved their money and though they had no restaurant experience, they bought a small coffee shop in 1985. The brothers work 13-hour days, seven days a week, washing dishes, cleaning and cooking in their Uptown Restaurant, which is simply decorated with salmon-colored <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> tables and brown Naugahyde booths. `` We did n't get rich here but we have a better standard of living,'' said <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>. He said he and his wife speak Arabic at home and try to instill Palestinian culture in their three children. The brothers say they are tied by blood and spirit to the land they still call Palestine and are troubled by the violence of the intefadeh, the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` When you see it on TV, especially when they beat a person, 10 years old, or 12 years old, or a lady ... you get upset, you get angry,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. `` It's a very, very evil thing that they treat human beings like that. ... I know it happens in different countries ... but when you see this happen to your own country, your own people ... I do n't think God himself justified this.'' `` The <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are suffering in a way like the Jews suffered from the Germans,'' he continued. `` -LRB- By -RRB- beating people and shooting people, breaking their arms, breaking their noses ... it's the same Killing is killing. Suffering is suffering. You ca n't justify what <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> did and you ca n't justify what the Israelis are doing against the Palestinians. The brothers are hopeful a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state will emerge, though they are n't certain how it would affect their lives. A settlement is needed soon, <PERSON> John </PERSON> said, `` before it's too late, before people get more anger and more hatred.'' But <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said if one comes, `` I do n't see it's going to last for too long. Neither one will be satisfied with their share.'' Would they return? <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said he might try to open a business, but would have to give it careful consideration. `` I live here 12 years,'' he said, `` it's not easy to leave.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> agreed. `` If I go back home one day,'' he said softly, `` I'm going to miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This is a metropolis of refugees. The capital of one country, it is filled with Palestinians who cherish dreams of another country across the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> was a dusty backwater of 35,000 people when the first Arab-Israeli war broke out in 1948. That conflict, and its successor in 1967, flooded <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> with refugees and many of them settled in and around the capital. Today, about 70 percent of the 1.2 million residents of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> are Palestinians, making it the largest urban concentration of Palestinians anywhere. Well-educated Palestinians, many sending home money from jobs in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, helped make <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> into one of the Third World's success stories despite the country's lack of natural resources Expensive cars roam <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>'s streets and spacious houses sprawl across its hills. Shops sell French cheeses, Italian clothes and Danish furniture to a population that averaged more than $ 2,000 per capita a year in income before an economic recession set in two years ago. The Palestinian stamp is evident in the savory aroma of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> sweets wafting from bakeries, and in the elaborately embroidered <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> dresses worn by many women. Young men wear the black-checked kaffiyeh headdress that has become an emblem of the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> But Palestinians in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> find themselves torn between two nationalities: that of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and that of a new Palestinian state declared in November by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. That conflict led to a war in 1970 and the defeat of Palestinian guerrillas by <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s Bedouin army. Palestinians refer to the supression of the Palestinian state within <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> as `` Black September.'' But for many, there is no conflict. They hope to remain in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> at least part of the time even if they gain a state in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. `` I do n't see that there has to be a choice,'' said <PERSON> Hazem </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuseibeh </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> foreign minister who comes from one of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s most prominent Palestinian families. `` To the contrary, I think if there is a solution it will be the creation of a Jordanian-Palestinian confederal union.'' <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> <PERSON> Samaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON>, 52, an <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> grocer, expressed gratitude toward the country that sheltered his impoverished family some 40 years ago, when it crowded into a one-room storefront in an <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> ravine. `` They gave us everything here, more than any other <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country,'' he told a reporter. `` We do n't think of ourselves as strangers.'' But his 18-year-old nephew <PERSON> Raed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamali </PERSON>, like many youths in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, said he yearns to go home to a country he has never known. `` If I could go, I would go. It's my country, we should go back,'' said <PERSON> Shamali </PERSON>, who wore a scarf fringed in the green, black, white and red colors of the Palestinian flag as he served customers in the crowded store. In 1950, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> annexed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and gave the Palestinians citizenship in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> lost the terrority to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in 1988 renounced claims to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, declaring `` <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is not Palestine'' _ a reference to proposals from Israelis that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> serve as the Palestinian state rather than let refugees reclaim property in what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said Palestinians in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> would have `` all the rights and privileges'' of Jordanian citizens until a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state is created.

 In statehouses across the country, lawmakers fear any significant alteration to <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> could trigger a political war that would make their years as reluctant soldiers in the abortion battles seem like a skirmish. The landmark 1973 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion ended most of the fierce struggling over the issue in state legislatures. But with the court reconsidering the issue, legislators are worrying about a return to the incessant emotional wrangling that preceded the ruling. `` If they overturn -LRB- Roe -RRB-, it will be the most tragic thing to happen in a long time,'' said Rep. H.L. <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, a Democrat from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, who is the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority floor leader. `` It will really be a nightmare.'' The high court is scheduled to hear arguments April 26 on <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion regulations struck down last July by the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Groups on both sides of the issue believe the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> might use the case to modify, if not overturn, the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision. Thirty-four states banned or severely restricted abortions in 1973, and 15 states still have anti-abortion laws on the books, although legal experts say it is not clear they could take effect if <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> was reversed. `` Gosh, I hope they do n't stir that up again. -LRB- It -RRB- was one of the worst things I've been through as a legislator,'' said Republican Rep. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Littlejohn </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, recalling the pre-Roe days when strident, sign-carrying abortion foes jammed the statehouse to protest <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>' liberal law. The appeals court struck down key provisions of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law that banned use of public hospitals or public employees for abortions, prohibited use of taxpayer money for abortion counseling, required doctors to test a fetus older than 19 weeks for viability and declared that life begins at conception. Most states stayed out of the case, but a few decided to enter the fray. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, which boasts of having the nation's most stringent anti-abortion laws on the books, was joined by <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> in filing a brief with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> supporting <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s position. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, which won a 1988 court case blocking <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to ban abortion at federally financed family planning clinics, filed a brief arguing against Missouri. Its brief was signed by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Most states have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, but forces on both sides of the issue have begun mobilizing support. `` I'm sure if they overturned the decision, there will be at least a dozen legislators jumping in with bills,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Maffei </PERSON>, legislative aide to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON>, a recently announced <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for governor. `` It would be a knock-down, drag-out fight decided by half-dozen votes one way or the other.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, expected in July, would come too late for the battles to begin this year; instead, most legislators see themselves starting the new decade under siege if <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> is altered. `` That would tie up every legislature in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a bitter debate,'' said <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorham </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority leader. For some, such as <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, that means the continuation of a no-win struggle that began in 1973 to whittle away at <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> on a local level. Last year, business stopped for several days in the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> while anti-abortion lawmakers filibustered a budget bill amendment to ease restrictions on Medicaid financing of abortions. Pro-choice legislators hold a one - or two-vote margin in the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ not enough to stop a filibuster but sufficient to block anti-abortion legislation The result is a stalemate, a situation not likely to change. `` There is a gridlock with very, very strong, intense views that seem not to be able to get either position to move,'' <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said. `` That's the reality of this state.'' A reversal by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> likely would trigger new legal fights over whether the anti-abortion laws still on the books in 15 states could take effect. In <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, for example, the old law required all abortions to be approved by a hospital board and performed in a hospital. The old laws in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> made all abortions illegal except those to save a mother's life. In <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, the pre-Roe law provided for a prison term of up to five years for anyone convicted of performing an abortion. Abortion opponents have kept the issue alive in many states as much as the courts have allowed. Two dozen states have passed laws that mandate parental consent for abortions for minor women, parental notification or both, and 10 or so are considering such bills this year. All but a dozen states have cut off Medicaid financing of abortions for poor women; in many of those states, efforts to restrict that money come up year after year. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, for example, the legislature has passed abortion-funding limits every year for the last decade, only to have them struck down by state courts. Fights over such restrictions, while often heated and disruptive, would pale next to the battles that might ensue if the justices were to return abortion to state control, some observers say. `` Once it goes back to the states and people will be playing with real bullets, it's a whole different ballgame,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>. Many legislators predict a reversal of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> would result in the issue dominating the legislative and electoral processes in many states. `` I've always said that if the court overturns on Tuesday, we'd introduce legislation on Wednesday to outlaw abortions,'' said <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lawmaker <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON>, leader of the anti-abortion forces in that state's <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> `` Any meaningful debate on any other public policy would come to a standstill,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>, majority leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` The question would be: Are you for or against abortion? That's how candidates would be picked, regardless of how they stand on other important matters.''

 The first battles following any major change in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1973 ruling legalizing abortion probably would erupt in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and 14 other states that still have anti-abortion laws on the books. The laws now are unenforceable because of the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision, but there is debate over whether they could take effect if the high court ever overturned the 1973 ruling. The issue would head immediately for the courts. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s law says that if the high court ever reverses the 1973 decision, the state's anti-abortion rules go back into force. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> have similar laws. `` Our law is broad and general and says the state can regulate abortions totally within limits of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions,'' said <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavert </PERSON>, a staff attorney for Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Guste </PERSON>. However, Democratic state Rep. <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, who has written most of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s anti-abortion laws since 1973, said he doubted the laws could take effect again and predicted a new law would have to be passed. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Stier </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, which has an anti-abortion law on the books from before the 1973 ruling, said he was not sure what would happen. `` Until we get a decision, it's so speculative it would be a waste of time to guess what the effect would be on <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> law,'' he said. `` There are an infinite number of possibilities of what might happen to the laws on our books.'' <PERSON> Stier </PERSON> said he would advise district attorneys not to begin prosecuting women for violating state law if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, an assistant state attorney general in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, said his office could not speak specifically about the state's 1852 anti-abortion law unless the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. But he said there had been previous cases in which old state laws went back into effect after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed itself. The other states with anti-abortion laws pre-dating <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> are <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, Connectituct, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. An attempt to repeal <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s law has passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and is now before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> officials contend the anti-abortion law the state enacted in reaction to <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> is the most stringent in the nation. Before 1973, abortion was a criminal offense in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Anyone giving an abortion could get up to 10 years in prison at hard labor. Since then, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> has passed many anti-abortion laws that have been found unconstitutional by the courts. Among the provisions thrown out were rules forbidding abortions in the first three months of pregnancy, requiring doctors to test the fetus to see if it could live, mandating parental consent for minors and requiring abortions to be performed only at hospitals by physicians. The only two provisions upheld prohibit public financing for abortions and require that parents of minors be notified of plans for an abortion.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was the nation's abortion capital before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> legalized abortions nationwide in 1973, and it likely would emerge again as a haven if the court ever reversed the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision. Women wanting to end their pregnancies would have more options than they did 16 years ago, when 34 states outlawed abortions, but <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> still has very liberal rules on who may have an abortion. Some states allow the procedure only because of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> and would see renewed attempts to outlaw or restrict abortions. Fifteen states still have anti-abortion laws on the books, although there is debate whether they could take effect if <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> was reversed. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would retain the abortion laws it has now and women from other states would come in here to get freely accessible abortions, which would be a burden'' on health services, predicted <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Benshoof </PERSON>, director of reproductive freedom for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Under <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s law, abortions are permitted up to the 24th week of pregnancy, as long as they are performed by a physician. Abortions after 24 weeks are allowed if a woman's life is in danger. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is one of just 12 states that still provide Medicaid money for abortions for poor women, and it was the only one of the 16 states permitting abortions before 1973 that did not restrict abortions to state residents. In neighboring <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, by contrast, women under age 18 are required to get their parents' consent for an abortion. The state also requires women to be hospitalized for the procedure and to report it to state authorities. Things are even more restrictive in some parts of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Benshoof </PERSON> said. She said she knows of women who have flown into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for abortions from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, where abortions are prohibited after 20 weeks of pregnancy. `` All these reasons make abortion more delayed and more expensive,'' she said. `` These women would want to come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to avoid humiliation and unnecessary delay.'' That was the practice during the brief period between the legalization of abortion in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1970 and the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ruling. Young women stopped flying to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and instead came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In 1972, a record 281,000 abortions were performed in the state. By 1974, the first year after <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the number had fallen to 162,000 and has been relatively constant ever since.

<HEAD>Consumer Food Prices Creep Up Moderately, Says USDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Barring another big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drought or a major disruption of international markets by sudden global losses in crop or energy production, it looks like another year of moderate food price increases for American consumers. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is forecasing that retail food prices may rise 3 percent to 5 percent in 1989, about in line with the upward creep of recent years. That estimate averages 12 monthly projections. But food ecomomist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> forecast could be revised later this month following a review of the price situation for the first three months of this year. `` What we're looking at, primarily, is that we've gotten so much stronger first-quarter prices, particularly in fruits and vegetables, than we had anticipated,'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said. `` We sort of missed ... with the cold weather in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and some in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> too.'' According to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, if the 1989 forecast is revised upward by a full percentage point _ to a range of 4 percent to 6 percent _ and if it proves to be accurate, the gains in food prices would be the highest in eight years. In 1988, the average of monthly food prices rose an average of 4.1 percent, the same as in 1987. The annual increases previously included: 8.6 percent in 1980, 7.9 percent in 1981, 4 percent in 1982, 2.1 percent in 1983, 3.8 percent in 1984, 2.3 percent in 1985 and 3.2 percent in 1986. <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analyst, notes in a new review that food costs `` rose at a much higher rate in the second half of 1988 than in the first half due to the severe drought and other market factors.'' By December, he said, prices were 5.2 percent higher than in December 1987, the biggest jump since 1980. The average 4.1 percent increase in last year's food prices was exactly in step with the broader rise in living costs as measured by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. In 1987, when food prices also rose 4.1 percent, the overall index gained just 3.6 percent. Economists look at two major components: food sold in grocery stores for use at home, and meals and snacks consumed away from home. The two rose at almost identical average rates over the entire year. But measured from December to December, food prices in grocery stores went up much more rapidly, partly because last summer's drought boosted prices for fresh vegetables, cereals and bakery products, eggs, and fats and oils By December, the food-at-home index was up 5.6 percent from a year earlier. Food served in restaurants, which is affected less by the costs of raw products, increased only 4.4 percent from December to December. <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> said the cost of the traditional market basket of food items used to compare retail, marketing and farm values from year to year rose 3.5 percent in 1988. The market basket includes only grocery items produced on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farms. It does n't include imported products or seafood. One of the features of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> market basket analysis is the `` farm value'' of various products. It is a translation of prices received by farmers into an equivalent amount for a specific item or quantity of food. For example, the average retail price of a pound of Choice-grade beef, as measured on an all-cut basis, was $ 2.55 in 1988. The producer's share, or farm value, was $ 1.47, or 58 percent of what shoppers paid. But that does n't mean live cattle sold for $ 1.47 per pound because it takes 2.4 pounds of live animal to make one pound of supermarket beef. Items that require lots of processing _ beef does not, relatively speaking _ show much smaller farm values. A one pound loaf of white bread, for example, sold for 61 cents last year. The farmer's share for all ingredients was five cents, or 8 percent. And that was up a penny from 1987. Overall, the farm value of market basket food in 1988 represented about 30 percent of the total, unchanged from 1987 and the smallest farmer's share of the consumer food dollar since <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> began compiling such figures more than 75 years ago. Department records show the farm value or share of the food dollar averaged 46 percent in 1913. The prevous low mark was 32 percent in the early 1930s; the high was more than 50 percent in World War II and for several years thereafter. Some economists, including <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Parlett, say that the trend to a smaller share for the farmer also reflects a growing consumer preference for a greater degree of processing in food. Hundreds of preparations, microwave items and many others commonly found in today's supermarkets were unheard of a few years ago. It adds up to huge spending on food. In 1988, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts, consumers spent an estimated $ 394 billion in 1988 for foods produced on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farms, up $ 19 billion or about 5 percent from 1987. That includes both meals at home and away from home. Some $ 97.5 billion, or about 25 percent of the total spent, was returned to farmers, a weighted blend of the 30 percent share for food at home and the much smaller 16 percent share of spending for food eaten away from home. In 1987, the farm share was $ 92.8 billion. The remaining $ 297 billion, or the `` marketing bill'' to get food from the farm to consumers, went to the food industry for handling, processing and retailing food after it left the farm. That was up $ 14 billion.

<TEXT>
 Following a trail that led from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> to a <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> camp to the nation's capital, two scholarly sleuths have come up with evidence of how <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> enriched `` the beginning of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> mind.'' On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will publish the results of their work, `` <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s Library: A Catalog with the Entries in His Own Order,'' in celebration of the 246th anniversary of the birth of the book-loving second president. `` His library not only offers a key to his own thinking but also symbolizes an admirable and important part of the cultural tradition of the American society he envisioned and helped to found,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilreath </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> wrote in their introduction. `` We knew that <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> had selected his library to be the best of what the Old World could offer,'' <PERSON> Gilreath </PERSON> said in an interview. `` But what is striking, to my way of thinking, is how much hope he had for the New World to develop this. `` At the end he always includes the American books, which were not at that time in the league with the European books. But it is clear that what he is anticipating is that this is the beginning of the American mind.'' <PERSON> Gilreath </PERSON>, the head of the rare book division of the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> authority at <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Galesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, claim to have solved a long-standing puzzle about how the sage of Monticello divided up his books by subject matter. The mystery they set out to investigate revolves around the library of approximately 6,700 volumes that <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> sold to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1815 after the original congressional library was burned by the British in the war of 1812. The books, carted from <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION> in wagons, formed the nucleus of the present Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Some two-thirds of them burned in another fire in 1851, but about 2,700 of <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s volumes still occupy two room-long book stacks in a vault in the rare book division. There has long been confusion, however, about how <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> intended the books to be catalogued. He divided the books into the categories of history, philosophy and the fine arts, an adaptation of <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>'s organization of knowledge into the categories of memory, reason and imagination. Within these divisions, according to a letter he wrote to a friend, he arranged the books in a `` chronological or analytical'' order. Librarian of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON>, who wrote that he single-handedly labeled and shelved the books when they arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, preserved <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s main divisions but arranged the books within each division alphabetically. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> said the change `` much injured'' his catalogue. Unfortunately, <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> took <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s own catalogue with him when he was fired as librarian in 1829, and it has never been located. In a massive five-volume work published by the library from 1952 to 1959, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> Sowerby </PERSON> tried to recreate <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s arrangement by using another manuscript catalog that <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> had composed in 1783 and revised extensively by writing between the lines By the time she reached the fourth volume, <PERSON> Sowerby </PERSON> was conceding that the catalog <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with his books `` differed substantially'' from the one she was using. At the time, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, author of a soon-to-be published edition of <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s notebooks, was consulting the 1783 catalog, which is at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` I formed some very different ideas,'' he said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Gilreath </PERSON> agreed with him. <PERSON> Gilreath </PERSON> went to the end of one of the shelves at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that hold the original <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> collection, picked up a slim volume that had lain there uncatalogued since 1954, and asked, `` Now, what do you make of this?'' `` I think this is what we're looking for,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a professor of English and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> library. The volume contained a manuscript catalog believed to have been prepared for <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> in 1823 by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trist </PERSON>, a young man who would later become his grandson-in-law and his private secretary. Correspondence between <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION> and Trist in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> showed that <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> had sent <PERSON> Trist </PERSON> a printed catalogue, probably <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON>'s catalog with <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s handwritten notes of the changes he wanted made. Using this, <PERSON> Trist </PERSON> prepared a manuscript showing the way <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> wanted his books arranged. He sent it back to <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> along with the printed catalog. The printed version has been lost, but <PERSON> Trist </PERSON>'s manuscript was found in 1917 in the library at Camp Wheeler in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. It was donated to the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The manuscript, bound in a volume along with a copy of the 1815 printed catalog, is inscribed, `` <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 1834, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>.'' For years, the book was mistakenly labeled as a catalog of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gilreath </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> believe <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> may have intended it to go there, since he was organizing the university's library at the time. At any rate, it was kept in the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> manuscript collection until 1954, when somebody decided it should be in the rare book division because part of it was printed. The first clue <PERSON> Gilreath </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had was that <PERSON> Trist </PERSON>'s manuscript and the printed catalog covered the same books in a different order In the Trist manuscript, books were arranged according to <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s values: the <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> expedition placed ahead of the much earlier explorations of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salle </LOCATION>, recent books on Greek and Roman ruins placed at the head of the chapter on architecture. `` So then we went to a lot of other sources and we discovered this letter from <LOCATION> Trist </LOCATION> indicating that he was sending back this catalog to <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> obviously went to him and that the catalog had been transcribed,'' <PERSON> Gilreath </PERSON> said. The clincher, he said, was when they were able to authenticate the Trist manuscript by establishing that its paper and bindings were identical with those in Trist's notebooks of the time.

 `` Mystic Pizza'' -LRB- Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95.

One -LRB- <PERSON> Annabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gish </PERSON> -RRB- is naive and serious and headed to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; her sister -LRB- <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> -RRB- is sexy and independent and terrified she has nothing to look forward to; and their feisty friend -LRB- <PERSON> Lili </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> -RRB- is determined to break out of her working-class mold. `` Mystic Pizza'' is a slice of their lives, spiced with romance that thrills, amuses and sometimes disappoints the women. But the best scenes are in the pizza parlor presided over by a cook -LRB- <PERSON> Conchata </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrell </PERSON> -RRB- who refuses to divulge the secret of her sauce. Their town, populated by working-class people who make a living from the fishing industry, and by the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> upper class, is beautifully photographed.

 A group led by ex-baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> could present a reduced bid for strike-torn <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to a committee representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> creditors at a meeting today. The Ueberroth group plans to lower its $ 464 million bid for Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, sources close to the sports figure and businessman said Monday. The reduced offer would reflect developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s new agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to buy Eastern's prized Northeast shuttle for $ 365 million, the sources said. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s original proposal _ which was withdrawn last week after he was informed it had been topped by another suitor _ was for all of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, including the <LOCATION> Boston-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Washington </LOCATION> shuttle service. Separately, union and airline sources said Monday that the 15-member committee representing unsecured creditors of Eastern was asking those interested in buying the airline to present their offers at a meeting today. Union sources also said that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to meet in the next few days with possible Eastern suitor <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Hyatt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> hotel chain. The Ueberroth group on Thursday withdrew its $ 464 million offer for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said it had been `` materially'' outbid by another suitor, identified by sources as <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>. However, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has n't eliminated <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s bid from consideration, sources close to the company have said. <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> offered about $ 500 million for the entire airline, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Hyatt chairman is expected to meet soon with the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots union, possibly today, union sources said. <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>'s offer is comprised of about $ 100 million in cash and the rest in debt securities, according to sources. The Ueberroth group, on the other hand, has said its $ 464 million offer included about $ 200 million in cash. Takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the owner and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also has expressed interest in Eastern and has garnered support from its unions. But he has not yet presented an offer to the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> board. The <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> group offered to give <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees a 30 percent stake in the airline in exchange for salary concessions. The proposals by <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> would involve similar arrangements, according to sources. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> were reported to be unavailable for comment when contacted Monday. In addition to reviewing bids, the creditors committee also may discuss strategy and organizational issues related to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws, according to people familiar with the proceedings who asked not to be identified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, who is overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization, has asked members of the creditors committee not to discuss developments at today's meeting with the press, the sources said. The meeting, possibly the first of a weekly series, is expected to be held in the offices of lawyers representing one of the creditors, they said. The creditors committee includes representatives of major aircraft and engine manufacturers, banks acting as trustees for Eastern bondholders, and the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> and pilots and non-union employees. The panel has the right to review any reorganization plan proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and can propose its own plan to the bankruptcy judge. It represents unsecured creditors, who are the most likely to lose money in the bankruptcy reorganization because they have no collateral, or security, from Eastern in case of default. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union at Eastern struck the airline March 4, drawing the support of pilots and flight attendants and bringing operations to a virtual halt. Eastern was forced to seek reorganization and bankruptcy protection from creditors five days later as its cash reserves dwindled.

<HEAD>Free Financing For 2-Year Loans At Chrysler</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has upped the ante in what could be a high-stakes, match-me incentive game by offering interest-free financing on two-year loans for all of its cars. The nation's No. 3 automaker made the move Monday, five days after <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> challenged the other automakers with 2.9 percent financing for two-year terms. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> followed <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s lead a day later. Interest-free automobile financing was last offered in September 1986 by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> bought less than a year later. Chairman <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the corporation's car-making arm, called the free financing deal `` the ultimate in APR -LRB- annual percentage rate -RRB- programs. `` It ca n't get any lower,'' he added. `` It ca n't get any simpler.'' In addition to the low financing for two-year terms, each of the Big Three also expanded and boosted some of their cash rebates and offered 5.9 percent financing for three-year loans and 6.9 percent for four-year notes. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will write a five-year loan for 9.9 percent, 1 percentage point lower than <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s rate for a 60-month term. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s program runs indefinitely. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s expires May 31 and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s runs out June 5. For a customer financing a $ 13,000 car with $ 1,000 down, meaning a $ 12,000 loan, the monthly payments on a two-year loan would be $ 500 under <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s interest-free incentive, and $ 515.24 under <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.9 percent plans. A two-year loan at 11 percent, a common open-market rate, would be $ 559.29 a month. For a more-common 48-month loan, a buyer of either a <ORGANIZATION> Chrylser </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> car would pay $ 286.80 under the 6.9 percent loans offered by the Big Three. With a market-rate loan of 11 percent, a 48-month loan would come to $ 316 monthly. Each of the companies acknowledged that the incentives would cut into their profits, and <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> said the company's earnings during the first six months of 1989 would be below last year's levels, and then rebound in the second half. But automobile analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> disagreed. `` I think the gradual increase you've seen in sales incentives over the last three or four months will have a significant impact,'' he said. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings are likely to be flat. A few months ago, I was looking for a good-size increase.'' The incentive war comes on the heels of unexpectedly low early 1989 sales and inventories that have been causing some worry, but no panic, among automakers. Each of the Big Three automakers set ambitious production schedules for the first few months of this year, and there are no large-scale moves to curtail them yet. Car and light truck sales through the first 80 days of 1989 have been running 5.4 percent behind the same period last year, the second-best in the industry's history. Sales figures for the first quarter of the year are due out today. The automakers are hoping that the new incentive programs will give sales a boost during April, when they usually are strong as Americans look forward to summer vacations and weekend driving trips. Interest-free financing affects only two-year loans, which in the past have made up about 12 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s business <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, president of loan-making company, said he expected that percentage to double with the new program. He also said the 6.9 percent interest rate for 48-month loans, down from 8.9 percent in <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s previous incentive program, will attract buyers who may have been considering five-year notes. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, unlike <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, has not seen a growing number of repossessions and loan defaults in the five-year loan category, which makes up about 60 percent of the company's vehicle-loan business. The interest-free loan deal was well received by dealers the corporation talked with during the weekend, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappert </PERSON>, vice president for sales at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>. But the program is bound to face strong criticism from <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Late last week, after <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> announced their new incentive programs, <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> called the incentive war a `` circus.'' He urged automakers to get out of the match-me incentive games and `` lower the prices once and for all and guarantee the public those are the prices.'' But <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, said that wo n't work Rebates frequently are used to bolster the credit-worthiness of a potential buyer by increasing their down payment, he said. `` We would greatly prefer to operate the way we used to operate, ...'' <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said Monday, `` but the reality is that is n't the world we live in anymore. Whether we'll ever get out of it is anybody's guess.

 Thirty-six more <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> jetliners have been found with crossed wiring or plumbing in fire-suppression systems, bringing the total number of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes with the problems to 95, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The 36 additions all belong to foreign carriers, <ORGANIZATION> KIRO-TV </ORGANIZATION> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> as saying. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> were not immediately reachable by telephone Monday night to confirm the data. As of March 10, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had received reports of 59 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes with crossed wires, <ORGANIZATION> KIRO </ORGANIZATION> reported. The problems have been found over the last year. The 36 planes either had crossed plumbing lines or crossed wiring in the fire emergency system, and most of the planes were built since 1981, <ORGANIZATION> KIRO </ORGANIZATION> reported. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> early this year ordered inspections of about 740 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s, 747s, 757s and 767s produced since 1981 to resolve concerns about crossed wiring. Most foreign aviation agencies ordered their carriers to make similar inspections. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> earlier confirmed that the repeated wiring mishaps have prompted the company to start an engineering study in an effort to prevent crossed wires and pipes. Two main miswiring problems can occur in the engine and cargo fire warning and suppression system and could interfere with the fire extinguishing system in planes, <ORGANIZATION> KIRO </ORGANIZATION> reported. Of the 95 total discrepancies, 68 were wiring problems, the station reported. Of that number, 24 planes had wiring problems in the engine fire warning and suppression systems and 44 planes were found to have cargo fire warning and suppression systems wiring problems. The other 27 discrepancies were plumbing problems, which were all on 767s.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trust filed suit Monday in an attempt to halt the sale of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> to an Australian company. The lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, came just three days after <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> proposed the purchase of the Los Angeles-based movie studio for $ 1 billion, the biggest of a series of moves by foreign firms to buy <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> companies. The Chappaqua Family Trust alleged that the price to be paid for <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION>'s assets is `` inadequate, unfair and fraudulently determined.'' Investor <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, who owns 82 percent of the company's stock, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tracinda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s holding company, along with <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> are named as defendants <ORGANIZATION> Chappaqua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> also alleges that <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> executives were derelict in their duty to stockholders because the sale, scheduled for completion on Sept. 30, was `` designed specifically to enable defendants <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Tracinda </ORGANIZATION> to unfairly withdraw substantial value from the company and to solidify and retain control over the balance of the company's valuable assets.''

<HEAD>C&amp;S Board Rejects NCNB Buyout Bid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Citizens and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is relying on a regulatory shield to fight an unwelcome $ 2.4 billion takeover attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a merger that, if completed, would create the nation's sixth-largest bank. The board of the parent company of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S Bank voted unanimously Monday to reject the <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> offer, calling it `` inadequate,'' and saying C & amp; S' management can better serve the bank's customers, shareholders and communities than can <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>. The surprise bid for <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S followed a push by <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> last year, in which it bought into the <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The move by the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, N.C.-based corporation drove its stock price up 50 percent, enabling <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> to mount other takeover drives with stock, not cash. `` We have managed this bank for service, growth, profitability and long-term service to shareholders _ not for a quick sale,'' C & amp; S Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The board of directors and the management have concluded that this offer is clearly inadequate and not in the best interests of C & amp; S shareholders, customers and employees,'' he said. In a statement Monday night, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> called its offer `` fair and generous'' and said its legal advisers felt there was no regulatory block to such an acquisition. `` We are determined to proceed, and request the C & amp; S board to reconsider our offer and promptly authorize negotiations,'' the release said. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer specializing in bank takeovers, said Monday there is `` some chance'' <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would respect the wishes of the board. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> is acting as special counsel to C & amp; S. He said C & amp; S is the stronger bank and that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has frowned upon a weaker bank taking over a stronger one. He also said the government is worried about banks that grow radically faster than their peers. Along with the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> acquisition, acquiring <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S would mean <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> would expand its size threefold in a year. Because of the structure of the <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S board of directors, he said, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> could not control it until two years after a takeover and noted that the government had rejected mergers with similar problems because of potential disruptions and discord between the board and the majority stockholders. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a tax specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Alston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Bird, the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> law firm representing <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S, said the acquisition might be blocked at the state level because by virtue of having more than 20 percent of its deposits in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> can not be considered a member of the Southeastern banking compact. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> banks can not be sold to banks outside the compact. He said <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> bank examiners might balk at the prospect of <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> moving <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> capital from <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to `` finance a speculative investment in a state outside the region.'' <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>, the Southeast's largest banking company, surprised <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S and financial observers Thursday with its $ 2.4 billion stock offer. C & amp; S management was cool to the idea from the start. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S it wanted to begin `` active merger discussions'' within five business days. Also Monday, the C & amp; S' board voted to adopt a new article in the corporation's bylaws, under <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s Business Combination Act, preventing any major shareholders from engaging in a business combination for five years, unless certain conditions are met. The move could make a takeover more difficult. A combined <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> and C & amp; S would create a formidable bank with $ 76 billion in assets. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> officials characterized their buyout offer as friendly and vowed to leave C & amp; S' managers _ and its name _ in place in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Under <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s plan, <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S shareholders would get 1.075 shares of <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> common stock for each of their C & amp; S shares. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> would have to issue about 66 million new shares to provide <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S stockholders with the $ 2.4 billion.

<HEAD>Minnesota Will Fight Northwest Takeover Attempt, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY R. SANDOK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> officials are pursuing a number of options aimed at thwarting a takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a move they see as a threat to the state's economy. `` They're in for one hell of a fight,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanasek </PERSON> said Monday of two groups that have proposed buying <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in suburban <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>. Investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has offered to buy <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.62 billion, or $ 90 a share. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> owns 3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s 29.1 million shares. A second, unidentified group of investors that owns 4.9 percent of the stock also is interested in buying the company, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> says. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock closed down 50 cents Monday at $ 84.37 -LCB- a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vanasek </PERSON> was among the legislative leaders and constitutional officers from both political parties, union officials and others who pledged at a news conference to back <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> in what he has described as an `` all-out war'' against a hostile takeover of the nation's fourth-largest carrier and one of the state's largest employers. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> has indicated its board will review the <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> offer, which he insists is friendly, but the company has said it intends to remain independent. The airline has not asked for state assistance, state officials have said. But unionized machinists, pilots, and flight attendants have asked the state to help ensure that <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> remains an independent company and that Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> International </PERSON> <PERSON> Airport </PERSON> remains a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> hub </ORGANIZATION>, state Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said The Democratic governor said the following actions are being taken: _ <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., who chairs a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee, assured state officials that he will conduct a hearing to investigate the financial background of any major investor involved in a potential <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> takeover Such an investigation, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said, would be aimed at ensuring the investor `` had the financial capability to operate <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in the professional manner on which the economy of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> depends.'' _ Members of the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> congressional delegation are being asked to develop an anti-takeover strategy at the federal level _ The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> departments will be asked to thoroughly review any proposed sale _ Legislation that would grant the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> commerce commissioner authority to approve a change of ownership of a corporation that occupies a controlling market share of any segment of the transportation industry is being researched for possible introduction in the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> _ The state attorney general's office is looking into the possible anti-competitive effects of a takeover of <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and legal remedies available to the state _ Legislative leaders are looking into possible legislative proposals aimed at protecting state workers and state public investment in the event of a buyout Asked which items on the list might thwart a takeover, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said, `` We do n't know, but we're going to explore every possible avenue.'' Industry analysts said it was unclear what, if anything, state officials could do to block a takeover. `` It makes total sense for them to do what they can, but how much of an impact can they have?'' asked <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> of Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> upholds his promise of expanding the airline and keeping its headquarters in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, the state would be worse off by blocking a takeover, said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` No management should be entrenched to the exclusion of a sale,'' <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said. The Legislature moved swiftly in June 1987 to block the threatened hostile takeover of Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by passing anti-takeover legislation. But the law does not affect <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, which is chartered in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. The anti-takeover legislation played a role in the defense of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, but the October 1987 stock market crash _ which slashed millions of dollars from the value of <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>'s holdings _ is largely credited with saving the company from takeover. Analysts have warned that a takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> would almost certainly result in the firing of some of the company's 35,000 employees. Northwest has about 17,000 employees in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said an additional 70,000 Minnesotans whose livelihood depends on the airline operation also would be affected by a takeover. Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> suggested that <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> could defend itself from takeover bids by issuing a special dividend to shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> could easily raise money for a special dividend, analysts told the newspaper, because it owns 73 percent of its aircraft fleet, the second highest percentage of the eight major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> could sell the planes and lease them back.

 <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that federal investigators are examining whether it engaged in illegal trading with the high-yield bond department at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The thrift has given `` cartons of documents'' to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heitz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president and general counsel. Some <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> employees have been subpoenaed to appear before a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> grand jury investigating criminal allegations against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, he said. However <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which already has agreed to plead guilty to six violations of securities fraud laws, said in a prepared statement that it was confident no wrongdoing involving <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> had occurred. `` <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has been one of the largest customers of the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> high-yield bond department, and we continue to have an important business relationship with that group,'' the company said. `` Like virtually every important customer of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield bond group, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> has produced to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney its entire trading records with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> for the past five - to seven-year period.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced the creation of a $ 500 million employee stock ownership plan today, one day after an investor group said it held a 5.3 percent stake in the aerospace company. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> said it would issue 10.5 million new shares for its employee stock ownership plan, known as an <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>, then buy back the same number of shares on the open market. The buyback was intended to offset the dilutive effects of the plan on the company's oustanding stock, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> said Many companies have used ESOPs as defensive moves against hostile takeover attempts. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> defeated an unwanted bid from <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, with an <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> as part of its defensive strategy. `` We do n't deny it has defensive characteristics, but that was not the primary purpose for the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slayman </PERSON> said today. `` The primary purpose is to create employee incentive tied to shareholder growth and value.'' On Monday, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> disclosed that his group, <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has a 5.3 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Slayman </PERSON> said today that the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> `` had been under consideration here for some time.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said his group's stake in <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> bodes no takeover attempt of the aerospace giant, a company he said is running just fine as it is. The company has taken defensive steps against <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> in the past. When <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> said last December it wanted to increase its holdings to more than $ 15 million, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> said it was implementing a `` poison pill'' shareholder rights plan. The plan would allow current shareholders to buy newly issued stock at a discount if an outsider buys 20 percent or more of the common stock. The effect would be to make it much more expensive for someone to take over the company. In December, <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> owned 0.63 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s 59.5 million outstanding shares. In midday trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> fell 87.5 cents to $ 48.87 -LCB- a share, after a delayed opening. The stock rose $ 3 a share on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> also announced steps today to help reduce its costs. The company said it would phase out its information systems group and sell the group's four units. No asking price was given. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> also said it would sell real estate in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> made available by the ongoing relocation of its aeronautical systems division to sites in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The company said its was accelerating the relocation to take advantage of what it called more efficient facilities. These steps and the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> `` will enhance our competitiveness in a rapidly changing environment where premiums are placed on innovation, efficientcy, quality and focused management,'' <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tellup </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday he did not intend to try to take over the aerospace giant, which produces the secret F-117A stealth fighter and is home to the famed `` Skunk Works'' _ the advanced development project area at <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> plant where such innovations as the P-80, the nation's first fighter jet, and the high-flying U-2 and SR-71 spy planes were developed. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said he might sell some of his stock if it rises another $ 3. He said he had not considered how many shares of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> he might buy. `` We view <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> as a well-managed company,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said in a Friday letter to <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> management, a copy of which he released Monday. `` We have no plans, or desire, to disrupt management. We expect to be a constructive, long-term shareholder.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said he is investing in <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> because he believes its stock was undervalued late last year due to anticipated cuts in the federal defense budget. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> share prices were at $ 39 and averaged into the low $ 40s when he began acquiring them, he said. In February, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> reported profit from continuing operations rose 3.5 percent in 1988, but profit rose 48 percent if proceeds of the sale of its Dialog computerized information services were included. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 624 million, or $ 10.37 a share, in 1988, up from $ 421 million, or $ 6.41 a share, the previous year. That profit was boosted $ 182 by the sale of Dialog. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> defense projects include the radar-evading stealth fighter, the Trident 11 nuclear missile, the C-5B transport plane and work on military communications, satellites, and the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars. The company is also a subcontractor for design work on <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s space station project.

 Stock prices were lower in early trading today but began regaining ground given up in a weak opening. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off by 1.46 at 2,303.34 after the first 90 minutes of trading. Declining shares held a lead over advances, outnumbering them by 629 to 520 and 571 shares were unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 50.07 million shares as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts had anticipated a possibly sluggish start to trading today after Monday's performance, which benefited from evidence of slower economic activity and a decline in interest rates.

 <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said today it has entered a joint venture to build a $ 50 million chemical plant in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and joined a group of companies studying a venture to expand a Soviet chemical plant. Dow said it entered a 50-50 joint venture with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Zhejiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION> to build a $ 50 million chemical plant in <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The new company, <ORGANIZATION> Zhejiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, will produce chemicals for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s growing polyurethane foam industry, reducing its dependence on imports, <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> said. The company's <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary was awarded a $ 15 million contract to aid in design, engineering, procurement of equipment and training of operating personnel for the plant, which will employ more than 200 people. The plant, in <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s east coast, is expected to be operating in 1993, producing 20,000 metric tons a year of polyether polyol, <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> said. Polyether polyol is used to make foam for furniture, seat cushions, mattresses, automobile parts, laminated fabrics and building and refrigerator insulation. The Chinese plant also will produce 5,000 metric tons a year of propylene glycol for use in pharmaceutical products, solvents and polyester resin. Dow also said it joined a consortium of Western firms, including <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Litwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, launching a four-month feasibility study of a joint venture with the Soviet petrochemical industry. The group is studying expansion of a petrochemical complex in <LOCATION> Shevchenko </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to add the manufacture of styrene plastics and ethylene derivatives. If the project proceeds, total capital is expected to amount to less than $ 1 billion, with <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Litwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> providing less than 50 percent of that, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Opperman </PERSON> said.

The economic restructuring, or perestroika, brings greater financial responsibility and the need `` to be a real businessman,'' said <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Konevskih </PERSON>, rector of the institute in <LOCATION> Khabarovsk </LOCATION>, about 30 miles north of the Chinese border and 350 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Khabarovsk </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>'s sister city in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. About 5,000 students attend classes at the institute. `` Our hope is that we'll be putting hundreds of students through this program,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Molander </PERSON>, program coordinator and chairman of the management department in <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. About 50 students specializing in industrial management are expected to start classes this fall to prepare them for the program. The full program, expected to cost the Soviets $ 250,000, will start in April 1990. `` It will be a great challenge, taking a business curriculum designed for a market economy and Western culture and to use that as a framework to educate a current generation in a centrally engineered economy that is becoming more market-oriented,'' <PERSON> Molander </PERSON> said. Soviet educational and business systems differ greatly from those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, so the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> State program will be adjusted to the Soviets' economic system, while retaining basic features like accounting, management, communication and marketing, <PERSON> Molander </PERSON> said. Some concepts, however, do n't translate easily, he said. The term `` marketing'' had to be adopted straight from English into the Russian vocabulary because there was no <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> equivalent, <PERSON> Molander </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed higher but below session peaks on Tuesday as a weak early trend on Wall Street curbed some of the optimism generated earlier in the day by the pound's recovery. Sterling's rise underpinned the market throughout the trading session, easing earlier fears that the British government would have to raise interest rates again to defend the currency. The recovery followed the pound's plunge in Far Eastern trading on Monday. But most of the market's gains were later erased by the weak trend on Wall Street. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 3.2 points, or 0.2 percent, higher at 2,082.8, near the day's low of 2,082.4 which came shortly before the market's close.

He was 52. <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON>, 57, is currently president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distribution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, part of the rival <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, Va.-based <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>British Mining Group Promises Big Dividend If It Doesn't Deliver</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday unveiled a novel defense against a hostile bid from <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, promisiBv to pay its shareholders $ 2.2 billion in dividends if it does n't meet its own profit forecast. South African-based <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, whose offer values all of the British mining group at about $ 5.4 billion, is trying to overturn a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court decision that threatens the bid. It would be <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest takeover ever A preliminary injunction arising from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> antitrust suit against <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> blocks it from buying more than 30 percent of Gold Fields' shares. The mining investment concern currently owns 29.6 percent of Gold Fields. Analysts generally expect Luxembourg-based <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> to raise its bid from its current cash and stock offer of $ 23.75 a share. Gold Fields shares rose 43 cents to finish at $ 22.92 on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Stock Exchange Tuesday <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s shares fell 19 cents to $ 12.63. Gold Fields guaranteed shareholders more than 20 percent average annual compound growth in earnings per share over the three years ending in June 1992. If its target of $ 6.80 in cumulative earnings per chare is n't met by the end of the 1992 fiscal year, then shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $ 10.20 per share, it said. Gold Fields has about 213 million shares outstanding. `` No British company has ever committed itself so firmly to value for its shareholders,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>. `` Gold Fields has both the assets and the management to see off <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> for good and our performance pledge is designed to ensure both value today'' and value tomorrow for all our shareholders.'' `` Quite a major scheme of -LRB- corporate -RRB- restructuring woUld be necessary'' to pay the special dividend, a company spokesman said. This could involve such moves as a stock offering of part of Gold Fields' highly profitable ARC construction aggregates business or of its <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the spokesman, who was n't identified, in accordance with British custom. The spokesman added there were n't any immediate plans for sales. The special dividend payment would require approval of a resolution by 51 percent of the shareholders authorizing the company to issue special preferred stock free to existing holders on a one-for-one basis. `` It's a phenomenal growth rate for any company to admit to,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's a very, very clever move'' by Gold Fields in its bid defense. The move could help determine the outcome of the takeover battle, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. Institutional shareholders in Gold Fields, many of whom are already flush with cash, might reject <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s offer in favor of a guaranteed realization of their gains over the next three years, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> said Gold Fields' latest defense was n't relevant to the takeover bid and `` will have no impact on our thinking.''

<HEAD>U.S. Farm Leader Calls For Protective Farm Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should write a 1990 farm bill on the assumption that the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> will block any chance of substantive progress for easing world agricultural trade restrictions, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm leader said Tuesday. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said the new legislation should continue the current Export Enhancement Program, which subsidizes the export sale of certain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural commodities, particularly those that must compete with subsidized <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> farm products. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to see the outcome of the current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of talks under the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade before there is a new farm bill. The current law, passed in 1985, will expire next year. Some want the 1985 law extended a year or two so that any <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> settlement can be considered as new legislation is drafted. `` I do n't think we should write a farm bill based on what we hope will happen in the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> talks,'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> told a news conference. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> are hung up mainly on long-term strategy and by what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators insist are distortions caused by certain subsidies and restrictive policies. But <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> officials claim there has been progress in overhauling the community's policies and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should compromise on some of its goals _ which at one time called for the gradual elimination of trade-distorting farm subsidies and rules. Negotiations resume Wednesday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> auspices. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> officials say they have agreed on `` progressive substantial reductions'' in agricultural subsidies, a phrase <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said he does n't understand at this point. Asked about <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> claims of already making progress in scaling back some of its agricultural programs, <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said he could n't see those actions have amounted to much `` In the total context of world trade, it really has n't been anything at all,'' he said. `` And it has n't done anything long-term.'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said the Europeans `` must make changes if we are to move toward more rational world agricultural trade'' but that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> `` refuses to entertain that notion.'' Although <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said he was not giving up yet on the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> of negotiations _ it has about two years still remaining _ he said there is some danger of agricultural issues taking a back seat to other trade matters. One of the reasons agriculture got attention when the current round began in <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> del Este, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, on Sept. 20, 1986, was the skyrocketing costs of government farm programs operated by many countries, including the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said. Food costs also were rising in some countries. But farm program costs have come down, partly as a result of higher commodity prices fueled by last year's <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> drought _ and lower support prices ordered by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the 1985 farm law. `` There's no question that last year's drought and the resulting higher commodity prices around the world took the pressure out of agricultural talks in this round,'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said. `` But droughts are temporary, they come and go. And so, the long-term problem is still out there.''

<HEAD>36 More Incidents Of Crossed Wiring, Plumbing Found On Boeing Planes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Crossed wiring or plumbing problems in fire warning and extinguishing systems have been found on 94 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said today. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said none of the problems directly affected the planes' airworthiness, and all were corrected before the aircraft returned to service On Jan. 31, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issued an airworthiness directive ordering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operators of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jets to inspect for possible wiring or plumbing problems in fire warning and suppression systems in aircraft engines and cargo holds. The directive was prompted by the discovery of 32 such problems in previous checks of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes. Only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operators were required to make the checks, but many foreign carriers followed suit voluntarily. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said that of the 63 problems found since the directive was issued, 36 were reported since the last update on March 10. Six were found on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft and 57 on foreign planes. Two problems were found on one aircraft, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said the names of the foreign carriers would not be released because they reported voluntarily and `` because we feel that would hinder the future flow of information.'' However, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> has said it found wiring problems on two of its 767s, <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> reported wrong connections on fire extinguisher bottles on four of its 737s and Japanese television network <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> reported last month that problems were found on 19 747s and 767s operated by <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. At the time of the March 10 <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> update, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had found an engineering solution to prevent wiring problems and were awaiting <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> approval for it. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said today the engineering changes were undergoing final review at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> before submission to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> for its approval. He said the changes involve the wiring and plumbing connectors, to `` physically differentiate the connectors so it will be much more difficult to connect them improperly.'' The initial cross-connection problems were reported about a year ago. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> `` has made a lot of progress looking at our assembly procedures in the factory and the functional tests in the factories,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> also is examining its maintenance manuals to see if instructions need to be clarified and whether there is a need to test the extinguisher and warning system functions when maintenance is carried out, he said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said `` in the vast majority'' of the problems reported, the fire suppression systems still worked. Both the cargo hold and engine fire extinguisher systems have backups. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said today that 19 of the 63 problems were found in the engine fire warning and supression systems. Of those, 10 were found on 737-300s and 737-400s, three on 767s, five on 757s and one on a 747. Forty-four problems were found in cargo compartment fire warning and extinguishing systems, including 30 on 747s, one on a 757 and 13 on 767s. The 32 problems found before the Jan. 31 directive was issued involved 12 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and 20 foreign aircraft. Eight of those involved engine systems, including four on 737-300s and 737-400s, three on 757s and one on a 747. The remaining 24 involved cargo hold systems: seven on 757s and 17 on 767s. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said that of the total 95 problems, 68 concerned wiring, with 24 such problems in engines and 44 in cargo compartments. The remaining 27 were fire extinguisher plumbing problems, with three in engines and 24 in cargo compartments. All the plumbing problems were on 767s.

<HEAD>Corning Reports $41.8 Million Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORNING, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Corning Glass Works reported Tuesday that profits were $ 41.8 million for the first quarter of 1989, a turnaround from a $ 46.8 million loss for the same period in 1988. Last year's first-quarter loss was a result of an accounting change in the way the company figured its retirees' medical benefits. The change resulted in a charge of $ 83.9 million against earnings in the first quarter of 1988. Excluding accounting changes and special credits from both years, <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>'s 1989 first-quarter earnings would have risen 12 percent to $ 41.8 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $ 36.8 million, or 41 cents a share.

<HEAD>New Budget Could Squeeze IRS Further, Congressional Auditors Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, already cutting activities, is likely to face another squeeze next year because President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> budget includes no money to enforce a new anti-drug law and the `` taxpayer bill of rights,'' government auditors said Tuesday. `` We question whether the administration has properly reflected what <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will need to assure adequate funding of its ongoing activities in fiscal year 1990,'' <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stathis </PERSON>, an associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` This budget is a real friend of the deadbeats,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, a member of the oversight subcommittee. `` The folks who do n't meet their tax obligations are going to experience a diminished threat'' with fewer <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> auditors and collectors, <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said. He noted that while the budget would require a reduction in the number of tax auditors, it anticipates fewer auditors will produce more revenue. There is nothing in the new budget to help the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> deal with the new drug law; the `` bill of rights,'' which is designed to help taxpayers involved in disputes with the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, or a new tax to finance catastrophic-illness protection for older Americans, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, acting commissioner of internal revenue. When the agency outlined its needs for the coming year, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> asked that its budget be increased by $ 1.3 billion, in part to reflect increased responsibilities under the new laws. That increase was scaled back by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, which, instead, approved a raise of $ 289 million, to $ 5.5 billion. `` I feel the 1990 budget does step us forward in tax administration'' despite some shortcomings, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told the subcommittee. But in the meantime, he added, `` We are dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and look forward to working with <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> to resolve those differences.'' Ms. <PERSON> Stathis </PERSON> said that although the budget for the current year is $ 360 million less than <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> needs, `` <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is functioning so far without any significant disruption to its basic operations. We are uncertain, however, what lies in store for the rest of 1989.'' In scaling back operations, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> vowed not to reduce assistance to taxpayers or slow processing of returns. The agency is reducing travel, training and purchases of computers and supplies. A hiring freeze was imposed for most occupations. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents most <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> workers, said <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> enforcement has suffered to the extent that in just six months the government has lost $ 1 billion in revenues that it otherwise would have collected. Another $ 1 billion will be lost by October unless the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is given more money, he added. This year's squeeze was caused, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, because of a mandated 4.1 percent increase in employee pay, higher postal rates and a rise in premiums for workers' health insurance and pensions. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> budget for next year is suspect because it fails to include some costs, including the anti-drug law and the taxpayer bill of rights, while anticipating savings that are questionable. The latter was a reference to <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> projections that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> can save a considerable amount of money by having private contractors, rather than federal workers, do certain jobs. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, which has been under intense criticism because its workers incorrectly answer taxpayers' telephoned questions about 30 percent of the time, was criticized by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> for spending $ 57 million this budget year trying to improve that record. `` Although the initiative is important ... <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' decision to fund it and other initiatives in 1989 added to the budgetary problems in other parts of the agency,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stathis </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices pulled back slightly today as the market relinguished some of the gains from Monday's moderate advance.

<HEAD>World Bank, IMF Endorse Bush Plan For Third World Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's Third World debt initiative won key endorsements Tuesday from the two international agencies expected to implement the strategy, with officials from both groups pledging quick action to get debt relief underway. Both <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, the managing director of the 151-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, president of the other global lending organization, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said they recognized the need for urgency in addressing the debt crisis. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said that any delay `` could be devastating in view of the expectancies which have been created'' about the prospect for a reduction in the $ 1.3 trillion level of Third World debt. In a speech to the final session of the spring meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said the bank had created a joint task force to work with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> to speed implementation of the new debt relief program. Earlier, the top policy board of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> issued a communique endorsing the general principles embodied in the debt program unveiled by Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> on March 10. The approval was seen as critical since the administration is counting on most of the financing for the debt relief scheme to come from the two lending agencies. The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan seeks to resolve the debt crisis by encouraging commercial banks to cancel voluntarily a portion of the loans they have made to Third World countries in return for assurances from the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> repayment </ORGANIZATION> on the remaining debt. The administration projects cutting the debt of 39 major debtor nations by 20 percent over the next three years with financing of about $ 12 billion each from the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials refused to discuss specific dollar amounts on Tuesday, saying that much will depend on how many countries adopt the economic reforms which will be necessary to qualify for the debt relief. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, said it was likely that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> would be the first country to qualify for debt relief. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> also have been mentioned as early candidates for assistance. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> told reporters at a briefing that the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> recognized the need to move quickly to spell out just how the debt relief will work in order to remove uncertainty in on-going negotiations between debtor countries and creditors. `` Nothing is worse than uncertainty,'' he said. `` The sooner we can assemble a program and provide answers, the better the chance for success.'' One reason for urgency is the growing political turmoil in many emerging democracies in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> stemming from the debt burden and the stagnation in living standards in the region. Riots left at least 270 dead in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> in February after the government imposed new debt austerity measures. The spring meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had been considered a critical launching pad for the new <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> laid the groundwork for approval by gaining the endorsement of the leading industrial countries for the debt relief strategy at a daylong negotiating session on Sunday. The statement by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> interim committee contained much of the same language as the Sunday communique issued by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. In another favorable development this week, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> pledged to loan up to $ 4.5 billion to developing nations over the next several years, a commitment that is viewed as critical since the flow of commercial bank lending has been drying up. The administration did not get everything it sought. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> steering group, because of objections from the British in particular, refused to endorse a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to use <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> funds to guarantee interest payments on the debt as well as the reduced amounts of principal. The British and some other countries had objected that the more costly interest-rate guarantees represented little more than a bailout to commercial banks who had made the loans. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> steering group promised to `` examine'' the question of interest rate subsidies. Dutch Finance Minister <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Onno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruding </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> steering committee, said that the language of the final statement did not mean the idea was dead, only that the finance ministers needed to know more details of how such guarantees would work. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, in a speech prepared for the closing session of the joint <ORGANIZATION> IMF-World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the administration would continue pushing for guarantees on both the reduced debt and the interest payments. `` We believe it is essential to establish both support mechanisms in order to provide adequate impetus'' for the banks to cancel a portion of the debt, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. French Finance Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON> told reporters that the Venezuelan riots had been an `` alarm signal'' showing more needed to be done to address the 7-year-old debt crisis. He predicted the debt issue would be a prime topic on the agenda when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attends his first economic summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in July.

 Oil prices headed higher in brisk trading Tuesday, with crude rising above the $ 20-a-barrel level and unleaded gasoline gaining more than a penny a gallon. Analysts attributed the rally to a variety of factors, including expectations of a bullish weekly trade report on oil supplies due to the Alaskan oil spill and bargaining hunting following Monday's partial selloff On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled 47 cents higher Tuesday at $ 20.42 a barrel. The contract had lost 24 cents on Monday. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Tuesday, the May contract for unleaded gasoline jumped 1.61 cents to close at 69.46 cents a gallon, after gaining 0.88 cent Monday. May wholesale home heating oil, which lost 0.62 cent at the start of the week, settled at 53.64 cents, up 0.89 cent. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, an energy analyst with E.D.F.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls While Gold Prices are Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar continued to decline Tuesday amid more signs that the major industrial nations want to bring the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency lower. Meanwhile, gold prices were narrowly mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported a bid of $ 385.90 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 385.80 late Monday. The dollar fell largely because of central bank intervention, which has squelched the currency's upward move for the time being, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The central banks, in response to requests from the big industrial countries, sold dollars over several sessions last week and again Monday and Tuesday to bring the dollar down. European dealers said the dollar fell Tuesday in response to comments by French Economic Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON> concerning the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement that the dollar should not rise or excessively decline. Officials from the seven countries _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ discussed the foreign exchange markets during a meeting last weekend in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Traders in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were also following foreign interest rate movements closely. Overseas interest rate hikes are bearish for the dollar because they make other currencies more attractive. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said the dollar might stabilize if <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> do not raise their interest rates. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.7043 late Tuesday, more expensive for buyers than Monday's late $ 1.6855. In later <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, the pound rose to $ 1.7085 from $ 1.6912 late Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.86835 West German marks, down from 1.87625; 1.63075 Swiss francs, down from 1.64125; 6.3060 French francs, down from 6.3300; 1,370.375 Italian lire, down from 1,376.625; and 1.18655 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18755 Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Monday's late rates, included: 1.8670 West German marks, down from 1.8835; 1.6358 Swiss francs, down from 1.6488; 6.3100 French francs, down from 6.3535; 2.1080 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1230; 1,372.75 Italian lire, down from 1,381.50; 1.1875 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1896 Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar dropped to 131.05 Japanese yen from 132.26. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Tuesday the dollar traded lower at 130.95 yen, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it fell to 130.85 yen from 131.775 late Monday. Gold dipped to $ 386.10 a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from late Monday's $ 386.20. Bullion was up more than $ 1 overseas. Gold traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the major market, at a bid $ 386.75 a troy ounce, up from $ 385.30 late Monday, while the <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> late bid price was $ 386.50, up from $ 385.25. Traders said that as anxiety about inflation was easing, the dollar's weakness would not help gold much. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 387.25 bid, up from $ 385.75. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 5.84 a troy ounce, up from $ 5.80.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday said it would not stand in the way of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.5 billion investment in <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest cellular phone company. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said the purchase of a 22.4 percent share of <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> did not involve a transfer of control of <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and it also was in line with federal restrictions on foreign involvement in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcasting or common carrier companies. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s common carrier bureau, said the 1934 Communications Act limits foreign stakes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communications companies to either 20 percent or 25 percent, depending on whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern has direct or indirect control of broadcast licenses. He said <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> does not hold licenses directly, but rather controls them through wholly owned subsidiaries. Thus he said the 25 percent limit applies. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> will gain control of four of the 19 seats on <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>'s board and acquire 22.4 percent of its stock. The deal is the largest yet for the fledgling cellular industry, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

 Stock prices pulled back in moderate trading Tuesday, relinguishing some of the market's recent gains. The market meandered in a narrow range in early trading before turning lower in the afternoon, partly weighed down by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 6.60 to 2,298.20. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 838 down, 643 up and 491 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 160.68 million shares, down from 164.66 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 187.21 million shares. A decline in the dollar against other foreign currencies depressed stocks. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said stocks and bonds had benefited from the dollar's recent strength on the theory that a higher dollar would bolster the confidence of foreign investors and attract capital from overseas into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets. Another negative influence on stocks was the announcement by several companies involved in takeovers that they were taking defensive measures. `` The market seems to be in somewhat of a holding pattern,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, adding that Wall Street may remain subdued this week, awaiting Friday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment statistics The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s employment report for March will furnish a fresh indication of how much the economy is responding to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to slow growth and diffuse inflationary pressures.

The estimate, which helped push <ORGANIZATION> Tandem </ORGANIZATION>'s stock to 14 ~, off 2 -LRB- in active trading, followed disappointing forecasts from other computer manufacturers, including <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> Elsewhere in the technology sector, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was down 1 -RRB- to 107 -LRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> lost 1 | to 96 <PERSON> Smithkline </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON> led the active list for much of the session and finished up \ at 65 ~ The stock was a strong performer Monday also amid speculation that a rival bid may emerge for the drug company following its disclosure that it is planning to merge some of its major operations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Beecham </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> shares fell 2 to 47 -RCB- on news the company estimated a 40 percent drop in its first-quarter net income and foresees an earnings decline in 1989. The company said it would issue 10.5 million new shares and buy back the same number of shares in the creation of a $ 500 million employee stock ownership plan. An investor group led by <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, which Monday said it had acquired a 5.3 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization plans are discouraging the group from increasing its stake for the time being. <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> skidded 3 -LCB- to 44 -LCB-.

<HEAD>SEC Charges Connecticut Broker With Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> investment broker allegedly bilked his clients out of more than $ 1.5 million by keeping their money for his personal use rather than investing it, federal authorities charged Tuesday. According to a complaint filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the broker, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, told relatives, friends and others that `` investments he would make on their behalf would be low risk, liquid and highly lucrative.'' However, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said, in a scheme that began in December 1986, <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON> made few investments, and instead deposited his clients' money into three accounts he kept at <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> At least 22 investors residing in four states invested about $ 1.8 million with <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> refused to name the states. According to court papers, `` after persistent requests or lawsuits'' <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON> returned about $ 250,000 to several investors. However, investors have been unable to get approximately $ 1,560,000 from <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON>. `` Investors found it difficult and sometimes impossible to get all or part of their investments back. <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON> evaded, deceived and made misrepresentations to investors regarding the return of their funds,'' the complaint said. <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutwin </PERSON>, said his client would have no comment on the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint. However, according to the court papers, <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON> told a meeting of his clients in November 1987 that he had not invested their money as promised. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griesa </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order on Tuesday freezing <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON>'s assets and ordering him to stop accepting money from investors. <PERSON> Griesa </PERSON> scheduled a hearing on the matter for April 14.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Tuesday it would oppose any move to close the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline but acknowledged it was unclear whether the federal government has legal authority to prevent it. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the authority issue was `` an open question.'' However, he said, `` I do n't honestly believe anybody wants to close the pipeline. Environmental Protection Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, meanwhile, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the massive Alaskan oil spill could put the brakes on petroleum exploration there and in other areas _ at least temporarily. `` We will take apart the environmental planning for every aspect of oil development in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and in other sensitive areas where the environment potentially could be threatened,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> has threatened to shut the pipeline unless <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and other oil companies produce a better plan to deal with oil spills such as the one that dumped 10-million gallons in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> on March 24. Democratic and Republican state legislators have backed up <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We've seen those comments -LRB- by <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> -RRB- but we simply do n't think it would be in the national interest to close the pipeline. `` We need to be aware of environmental precautions and safeguards that can and should be taken as a result of this incident but we remind people that the pipeline supplies 25 percent of our daily domestic oil production or one-eighth of our daily consumption,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` And while we share his environmental concerns we would not anticipate closing the pipeline.'' The press secretary said no consideration had been given to the idea of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> going to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for a firsthand look at the environmental damage from the spill. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> assured <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the administration will thoroughly review environmental safeguards in areas under consideration for oil exploration. `` We are doing that, as you know, off the coast of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> ... We'll do it in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and look very carefully at future contingency planning there and we'll do it on the north slope,'' he said. `` I think we owe that to the environment, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> added. `` We owe that to common sense.'' Asked if the administration would hold up exploration of the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> pending completion of the review, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said, `` There is a very clear understanding that we will not move forward if we have any significant concerns that have not been resolved.'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> was called to testify before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on independent agencies about the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget but the committee first grilled him about the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill. Acknowledging a lack of adequate precautions for such an accident, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said, `` The contingency plan itself was not adequate to anticipate, contemplate, prepare for and respond to a spill of this magnitude. It was not. `` There's no question about that but ... the response was not adequate, either,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said Tuesday he has asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to assign administration officials to gather scientific information from other countries that have experienced large oil spills so residents of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> know what to expect in the future. In another indication of the economic impact the spill will have on fisherman, <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> said Japanese buyers of Alaskan seafood have said they will not make purchases this year from the Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> area. Earlier, Alaskan officials announced that the herring fishing season in the sound would be canceled this year. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, meanwhile, criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for choosing to not impose a federal takeover on the cleanup. He also introduced legislation that would require the government to clean up oil spills unless the company involved was doing an effective job of dealing with the accident. `` Within a few days after the spill occurred, it was clear that the clean-up effort was inadequate,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` Valuable time _ the most valuable time _ was lost.'' In other legislative action, Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, introduced a bill that would give the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> access to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> so that it can check the driving records of prospective oil tanker pilots for drunk driving convictions. Exxon Valdez Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was fired and charged with being drunk at the time of the accident.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> crews Tuesday finished pumping the remaining crude oil out of the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> in preparation for refloating and removing the source of the nation's worst-ever oil spill. The fugitive captain of the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> sent signals he was ready to surrender to face criminal charges of operating the vessel while drunk. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said placing an oil-catching boom around the ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a giant explosion of gases from the oil, although that was not the reason it took 11 hours to set the first containment line. `` The worst thing we could have done early on was try to boom the vessel. We would have lost the vessel,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> A boom was n't placed around the vessel for 11 hours because it was n't available in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials have said. <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has changed its policy because of the spill and now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited, four hours before sailing. Authorities charged the captain had been drinking before the Valdez sailed. Thick oil has floated over more than 1,640 square miles and soiled 800 miles of beach. Thousands of animals are known dead, including 30 sea otters. Early Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it had finished transferring about 42 million gallons of crude to three other ships. Another 42 million gallons of oily waste water remained aboard the Valdez, which spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> when it struck a reef March 24. The company said crews would attempt to pump air into the hold and refloat the vessel off a reef at high tide Wednesday afternoon. If freed, the still-leaking ship, which has eight holes some 20 feet long in its hull, will be towed to a remote and already fouled cove for repairs. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> then planned to take the ship to a port in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, or to a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, dry dock. Port officials there said they were n't sure if they'd allow that, even though the $ 12 million repair bill would provide about 200 jobs. `` We're not willing to trade in the environment for jobs,'' <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> port spokesman <PERSON> Darrel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buttice </PERSON> said Monday. Oregon Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> said Tuesday there are `` a lot of questions that need to be answered'' before the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> is allowed in. Canadian authorities also asked <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> for assurances there will be no damage to the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> coast if the tanker is towed to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, and the mayor of <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said the ship was not welcome back in the port where it took on the load of crude. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said the spill could put the brakes on petroleum exploration there and in other areas. `` We will take apart the environmental planning for every aspect of oil development in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and in other sensitive areas where the environment potentially could be threatened,'' he told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee. The family of the fired <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> captain, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, said the skipper wants to surrender but is awaiting advice from his attorney, according to Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. But after <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> law enforcement authorities waited a second day for <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> to turn himself in, the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office announced there would be no surrender that day. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, is accused operating the ship while under the influence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. Bail was previously set in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> at $ 50,000. Of about three dozen oil-soaked otters rescued following the spill, about one-third have died, <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game spokesman <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> said. `` Dozens of otters are dying before rescuers can get to them,'' he said. Six otters were flown to Sea World in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> on Monday for rehabilitation. Fishermen counting on the sound's $ 12 million annual herring industry were told Monday by the state that it will not allow a season this year. Sablefish and shrimp fisheries in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> waters also have been closed. An effort at <LOCATION> Sawmill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, 11 miles west of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, to keep oil away from a hatchery where 2 million salmon are waiting to be released to the sea appeared to be failing. Tendrils of oil had floated past a boom streched across the bay, said officials. The spill has shifted public opinion in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> about the energy industry, which has been lobbying for new exploration. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, a champion of oil exploration in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, asked that plans for drilling in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the state's richest fishing grounds, be set aside until the industry can demonstrate that it can respond effectively to spills `` The Exxon Valdez accident has taught us that simply having a plan is not sufficient,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said. At the first <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting since the spill, two council members and Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Devens </PERSON> expressed concern that anger and frustration over the spill was surfacing as harrassment of pipeline company workers and their children. Meanwhile, a multimillion-dollar class-action lawsuit was filed Monday in federal court in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, charging that the spill has led to gas prices of 10 to 15 cents more a gallon for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> drivers.

<HEAD>Oil Flow Returning To Normal In Trans-Alaska Pipeline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline was increased again Tuesday and will return to its normal daily level of 2.1 million barrels Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said. Flow through the pipeline had been cut by 60 percent because of restrictions on tanker travel through <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> harbor after the Exxon Valdez accident. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> said tankers may now handle the normal load even though some <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> travel restrictions are still in effect. `` Inventory is very low, so we still have storage -LRB- in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> -RRB- to handle it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> said. `` And we are able to bring in enough tankers.'' The Coast Guard on Monday restricted traffic to daytime hours only, and required a two-tug escort for tankers. In addition, only one tanker at a time is allowed to pass through the area. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> is the only port from which North Slope oil is shipped. The reductions have caused <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> refinery shortages and higher oil prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> averages three tankers a day, and `` we're not too far away from that.''

 The federal judge overseeing the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy case ordered the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trustee in the case late Tuesday to show cause why he has postponed the appointment of a bankruptcy examiner. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trustee <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> to explain at a hearing Wednesday why <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> postponed the naming of an examiner Tuesday at the request of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and a committee representing its unsecured creditors. The order was highly unusual for a bankruptcy case, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>'s law clerk. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, who is overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Chapter 11 reorganization, recently ordered appointment of an examiner with unusually broad powers, including a mandate to mediate the bitter labor dispute at the carrier in an effort to get it flying again. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who is responsible for administration of the Eastern bankruptcy case, declined to say in a telephone interview earlier Tuesday why the company and creditors had asked for a deferral of the examiner appointment. However, union sources speculated that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the committee wished to postpone the appointment until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> rules on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request that he declare a walkout by its pilots an illegal strike and order them back to work. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' decision is expected sometime this week. The pilots' walkout in support of a Machinists strike that began March 4 has been crucial to the success of the strike and has forced the airline to sharply curtail its flight schedules. Eastern's flight attendants union also is honoring the strike. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> had said the naming of an examiner to be appointed by <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> could be made Wednesday or later. He was unavailable for comment late Tuesday after the judge issued his order. Miami-based Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court on March 9 due to a cash crisis created by the strike. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said `` substantial progress'' was made at a meeting Tuesday between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the 15-member unsecured creditors committee, which also includes representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> unions and its non-union workers, but he declined to elaborate. The creditors committee had requested potential buyers for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, including hotel executive <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> and a group led by ex-baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, to present their proposals at its Tuesday meeting. Little was immediately known of developments at the closed-door creditors committee meeting at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> law firm. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> had asked members of the committee not to discuss developments at the meeting with the news media, according to people familiar with the proceedings who asked not to be identified. The Ueberroth group made a $ 464 million bid to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> but withdrew it last week after the airline's parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> indicated it had received a higher offer. The group planned a revised, lower offer, that reflecting developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s new agreement to buy Eastern's prized Northeast shuttle for $ 365 million, sources close to <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, former head of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has offered around $ 500 million for the whole airline, according to sources close to the situation. <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which has expressed is interested in buying <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757s and the shuttle's landing slots in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said it still considers itself a potential buyer. The regional airline is not in discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> but it is watching developments closely, said <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicino </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Phoenix-based <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> who was visiting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> believes it still could bid for the shuttle because the sale to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has n't yet been approved by the bankruptcy court. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said Friday he expected the deal to be closed within 60 days. The creditors panel has the right to review any reorganization plan proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and can propose its own plan to the bankruptcy judge. In a separate development, Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> announced that it would not pay dividends for the first quarter on its four outstanding issues of preferred stock. The dividends would have been payable on March 31, April 15 and April 30, depending on the issue, the airline holding company said. Also Tuesday, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> approved <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sale of three <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-100s to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for a total of about $ 10.8 million, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The sale fulfills an accord signed last September in which <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell 10 of the planes to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the first seven were delivered between September and February. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> pulled off the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor legislation that would require President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint an emergency board to recommend a solution to the walkout. The Democratic lawmakers attributed their reversal to a desire to give potential buyers a chance to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and to allow the bankruptcy court to find a way to end the walkout. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional Republicans have opposed the measure, saying the carrier's management and unions should work out their dispute privately. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had threatened to veto the bill, which was slated for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor debate Tuesday.

<HEAD>Aerospace Company Says Restructuring Unrelated To Investor's Buy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday a reorganization that includes the creation of an employee stock plan was unrelated to investor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' purchase of 5.3 percent of the aerospace company's stock. The restructuring plan also includes the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s computer operations and acceleration of a previously announced program to move aircraft manufacturing operations from <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> and sell about 225 acres of land there That land includes the `` Skunk Works,'' where the F-117 stealth fighter is made. The plan was approved at a board of directors meeting that was scheduled before <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> revealed Monday he had accumulated 5.3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s 59.5 million shares, said company spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Slayman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> makes the Trident II missile, the C-5B military transport plane and works on <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s space station project and the `` Star Wars'' missile defense, in addition to other military and aerospace projects. `` There is no denying there are defensive characteristics to these things, but that is not the primary purpose,'' <PERSON> Slayman </PERSON> said of the employee-stock plan, or <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>, and the other moves. `` The primary purpose is to enhance our competitiveness. This gives -LRB- employees -RRB- a bigger stake in the success of our company.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> _ who also said he planned substantial investments in <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Paccar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> management last Friday that he did n't intend to try to buy the company. `` We have no plans, or desire, to disrupt management. We expect to be a constructive, long-term shareholder,'' the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> investor said in the letter, which he released to the press Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> would buy 10.5 million newly issued shares of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> stock for $ 500 million, and the company would offset the dilution of its stock by buying an equal number of shares held by the public. Establishment of the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> would result in employee ownership of 17 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> common stock, the company said. Such plans are sometimes used to defend against hostile takeovers because it places stock in friendly hands. For instance, an <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> was instrumental in <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s successful defense against a buyout by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> adopted a `` poison pill'' takeover defense in December after <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> disclosed he intended to buy up to $ 15 million worth of the company's stock. That plan would entitle current stockholders to buy additional, newly issued stock at a discount in the event of a hostile takeover attempt, thus making a buyout more expensive. On Monday, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> he intended to invest at least $ 15 million each in shares of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Paccar </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, truck maker. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring plan includes: _ The speedup of the previously announced move of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> from factories next to <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>, Ga The moves, part of a consolidation effort, are to be finished in 1991 instead of 1992 or 1993, as executives previously stated. The move will free 225 acres in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> for sale, the company said, revealing for the first time the acreage. _ The four companies or divisions that make up <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s information systems group will be The group, with 3,900 employees, accounted for $ 589 million of the company's $ 10.6 billion in 1988 sales. To be sold are <ORGANIZATION> CalComp </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CADAM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and DataPlan of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> directors decided Tuesday to buy up to 8 million shares of the company's stock, but the media conglomerate would not say the move was designed to thwart a potential takeover. The stock repurchase plan was authorized by the board of directors one day after reports of the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, acquiring 2 percent to 3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stock. Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> declined comment. <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> would not say whether the plan was designed to stop a possible takeover by <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it would issue $ 350 million worth of a new series of convertible preferred stock to its employee stock ownership plan. Money from the sale will be used to buy up to 8 million common shares on the open market. The company said it will make a loan to the employee stock plan to finance the purchase of the convertible stock. `` Expansion of the -LRB- employee stock plan -RRB- increases ownership by our employees and recognizes their significant economic stake in <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s continued success,'' said <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. More than two years ago the company said it would repurchase 10 million shares.
