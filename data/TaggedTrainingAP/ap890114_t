 <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> figures he proved he's an American by serving in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, so he refuses to document his citizenship to keep his job. That refusal got the 40-year-old machinist fired Friday, the deadline his boss set for filling out a government form employers have to keep to prove all their workers are citizens or legal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents. `` When I was 18 years old, they sent me a draft notice. They knew I was a citizen then,'' <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> said. His boss, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of S & amp; D Specialties, said he wishes he could keep <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> in the $ 12-an-hour job making parts for hydraulic cylinders. But if he did, the company would risk a $ 500 fine for failing to keep the new form required by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` They did n't give me a lot of options. It's a federal law,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said. The law is part of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which extended amnesty to illegal aliens who can prove they're longtime <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents The law also imposed the employer penalties in hopes of cutting the influx of new illegals. <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> acknowledged the government did n't want much: He was supposed to fill out the form and supply driver's license and Social Security numbers. `` It's a matter of principle, all right,'' he said. He ignored the form during the six months he's been working in this town 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> decided he had to set a deadline, and the men agreed Friday would be <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>'s last unless he did the paperwork. <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> enlisted man in 1969 and said the government should have taken military service into account. Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said the service ca n't make exemptions for veterans. `` Does he want to cooperate and help us control our border?'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> asked. `` He did serve his country, and this is another way of helping his country.'' <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> does n't have any firm plans for a job hunt. One thing's for sure: He wo n't take a job if they ask him to fill out the immigration form `` I do n't think I will,'' he said. `` I really do n't.''

<UNK>Italian Researcher Descends Into Cave for Isolation Experiment</UNK>
<DATELINE>CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 27-year-old Italian researcher has begun months of isolation in a Plexiglas enclosure inside Lost Cave as part of an experiment. `` Ciao!'' <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON> <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> called out Friday as she grinned, waved and descended a 20-foot ladder. Pioneer Frontier Researches and Explorations, an Italian team of speleologists and researchers under the direction of <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON>, hopes their experiment will yield knowledge about the effects of long-term space travel. Joining her underground for a brief farewell party were <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON>, team physician <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvagno </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodbar </PERSON>, and several friends. They shared wine, and Ms. <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> sang a few songs and played the guitar before her guests left her alone in the cave, and its entrance was sealed. Ms. <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> then began to make herself at home in the 100-square-foot enclosure she had not seen before Friday. The room in which she plans to study English and practice judo is sparsely furnished with a red metal chair and a table holding two computers. It has 400 books. The cave is adapted so that Ms. <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> will be isolated from sound, sunlight and human contact _ even the sound of a human voice _ for at least four and probably five months. She will be monitored by a video camera and brain electrode implants. <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> called her isolation `` a long and lonely circumnavigation, not of the world, but of a single mind _ your own.'' Supplies pack shelves from floor to ceiling. Her bed consists of several foam pads spread across the wooden floor. Her chemical toilet is secluded from the camera's view. A five-month food and water supply are stored in the cave. While electrode implants monitor her brain waves, Ms. <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> will place blood and urine samples in a container to be pulled to the surface. The samples will be tested for immunology, endocrinology and hormones at three U.S.-based medical centers. <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> said the tests would come at random intervals to keep Ms. <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> from knowing how much time elapses. Officials say an essential element of the experiment will be her time perception.

<HEAD>Greater Demand Pushing Up Prices, Planting Plans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rising demand and easier federal curbs are encouraging the nation's wheat farmers to boost production this year, beginning with nearly 6 million acres more of winter wheat for the 1989 harvest. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that winter wheat plantings last fall totaled 54.5 million acres, up 12 percent from 48.8 million acres seeded for last year's harvest. Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following year. It accounts for about three-fourths of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat output. Production was cut last year by drought, and brisk export demand has helped reduce stockpiles. With greater demand, prices have risen substantially the past year. Also, farmers are being required to idle only 10 percent of their wheat base acres for 1989 in order to qualify for government price supports, compared with 27.5 percent previously. `` All states increased acreage from 1988 except <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its report. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> are unchanged.'' In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, the largest producer, wheat plantings jumped 22 percent to 12.4 million acres. Nationally, the 54.5 million acres of winter wheat planted for 1989 is the largest acreage since 57.8 million acres were planted for the 1985 harvest, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> records. In a supply-and-demand analysis, officials said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> total wheat stockpile on June 1, the beginning of the 1989-90 wheat marketing year, could be whittled to around 534 million bushels, less than half the 1.26 billion bushels in the June 1, 1988, inventory. It was more than 1.82 billion bushels on June 1, 1987. Export subsidies and other government programs have helped boost wheat sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other foreign buyers. Total shipments in 1988-89 are expected to be around 1.5 billion bushels, more than double the 700 million bushels needed to cover <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic food requirements. Meanwhile, wheat prices at the farm have risen to a predicted range in the current marketing year of $ 3.60 to $ 3.75 per bushel, on the average, compared with $ 2.57 in 1987-88 and $ 2.42 in 1986-87. A comparable situation has developed for some other grains hit by last year's drought. Corn prices, for example, were forecast at an average of $ 2.30 to $ 2.70 per bushel in the 1988-89 marketing year that runs through August, compared with $ 1.94 last season and $ 1.50 in 1986-87. Another report showed the Dec. 1 inventory of corn at 7.07 billion bushels, down 28 percent from a year earlier. The wheat inventory, at 1.71 billion bushels, was down 32 percent from Dec. 1, 1987. Soybean stocks as of Dec. 1 were reported at 1.37 billion bushels, down 22 percent from a year earlier. A review of overall 1988 crop production showed relatively minor adjustments in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s previously announced harvest figures, with the exception of corn. Last year's corn harvest was reported at 4.92 billion bushels, up from 4.67 billion bushels estimated last November. Even so, the 1988 corn harvest was down 30 percent from 1987 production, with the drought-reduced yield averaging 84.6 bushels per acre, compared with the record level of 119.4 bushels per acre in 1987. The 1988 harvest of all wheat was a decade low of 1.81 billion bushels, down 14 percent from 1987, and soybeans last year totaled 1.54 billion bushels, 20 percent below 1987 production. Cotton output, at 15.4 million bales, was up 5 percent from 1987 and was the most in seven years.

<HEAD>DOT Reconsidering Cutback In Rural Air Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Transportion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is taking a second look at a plan it introduced last month that would force some small airlines to eliminate unprofitable routes in sparsely populated areas. <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> cited budget restraints when it proposed sharply curtailing its `` Essential Air Service'' program. Under the program, the federal government subsidizes flights to and from about 150 small cities that would probably not otherwise have air service because the routes are not moneymakers. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON> said an announcement could be made as early as the beginning of next week about changes in the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> plan. He would not elaborate, but another department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: `` There is something under consideration. There is movement to responding to a congressional request.'' He added, `` Nothing has been signed yet, and it's not a decision until somebody signs it.'' The original proposal was swiftly attacked by lawmakers from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and other states that would be especially hard hit. Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the reductions would be `` a fatal blow'' to the economic growth efforts of some communities, and Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., said the plan could mean the end of commuter air service in The original DOT action was in response to a $ 6.6 million shortfall in the air service program's appropriation for the 1989 fiscal year. The department proposed four likely plans for coping with the cuts. One of them, considered the harshest by some, would cut 53 cities entirely out of the program. One-third of those cities are more than 100 miles from the next nearest airport. In defending the cuts, the department has pointed to little-used flights that receive subsidies in remote areas. For example, the government spent $ 379,000 in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> last year to keep flights going between <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION> that averaged one passenger. The route would probably be eliminated if the subsidy ends. But <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> said ending subsidies to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> cities could do more than simply inconvenience passengers who would have to travel to another airport further away. `` For rural areas, there is a direct link between adequate air service and economic development,'' <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> said. `` One of the first questions business leaders ask when they come to look at rural areas is: ` What's the air service like?''' In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the cutbacks could mean the end of flights in and out of <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Clarksburg-Fairmont </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Elkins </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION>. In releasing the plan on Dec. 14, the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> said it hoped it could take effect on March 1, following a public comment period. <ORGANIZATION> Exec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which operates in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said in a letter to Rep. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>: `` From our standpoint, any cut in the <ORGANIZATION> Essential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> program would be devastating. Exec Express II has been rebuilding air service in communities which have not had adequate service in the past.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are challenging subpoenas from <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, while prosecutors say <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s continued demand to use classified information is an effort to torpedo his upcoming trial on charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair. The government filed a motion in federal court Friday to quash the subpoenas for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose testimony is being sought by <PERSON> North </PERSON> as part of the fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide's defense. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` has not made the requisite showing of relevance, materiality and need for specifically identified information that he seeks to obtain'' from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said that in accordance with an offer made last Sept. 28, the president will consider furnishing appropriate information with written answers to `` reasonable written questions'' from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` joins that offer.'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> served the subpoenas Dec. 22. `` The spectacle of a former or sitting President being subjected to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in the way they deal with the President now and in the future,'' the government said in the motion to quash the subpoenas for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appear at the trial. North's lawyers, meanwhile, served the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with subpoenas for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to turn over various personal papers for use by the defense, said department spokesman <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Earlier in the day, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> dismissed the two central charges alleging that <PERSON> North </PERSON> illegally diverted more than $ 14 million in U.S.-Iran arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> had filed a motion Jan. 5 seeking to have the two charges dropped, citing <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s `` insistence on introducing classified information in his defense'' and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's refusal to release material the judge ruled that <PERSON> North </PERSON> would need at trial. North's attorneys said proof of their client's innocence is contained in classified material. Twelve criminal charges remain against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, and the issue of dealing with classified information in open court remains a problem. Attorneys for both sides held closed-door morning and afternoon sessions with <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on classified information as it relates to the remaining counts. The attorneys will resume the closed-door discussions next Tuesday. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in a court filing Thursday that the remaining charges can be tried `` without opening the door for'' North `` to use reams of classified information'' and that <PERSON> North </PERSON> should be barred from seeking to prove `` a host of irrelevant matters for the sole purpose of scuttling the entire case'' by using national security grounds to do so. However, defense attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said last week, `` classified information pervades the remaining charges as well.'' Nine of the counts focus on charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON> concealed from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> his efforts on behalf of the Contras. Four of the nine deal with alleged concealment of a diversion of money to the Cntras from the administration's secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. North also is accused of illegally accepting a $ 13,800 security system at his home from co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, converting to his own use at least $ 4,300 in traveler's checks from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> of tax revenue in connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.

<TEXT>
 Outgoing Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> says many American products are below world standards of quality and the Japanese are two years ahead in developing salable products from American inventions. Blaming antitrust laws for a large part of the problem, <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> urged President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to prepare for `` economic warfare'' in the 1990s. `` What's going to be on the top burner of the 1990s for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is trading, and how is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> going to make sure it will be the number one player,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said Friday in a last speech for `` Export Now,'' a campaign he has pressed in his 18 months in office. As President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> retires next week, <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> will follow. An old friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil industry, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, has been named to succeed him. `` The reason that many American products are not selling abroad is very simple: because they do n't have sufficient quality to do it,'' he said. He told how his family company, <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had been a big supplier of sheet steel to the American auto industry, but had to work five years to produce steel that would meet the standards of <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese auto-maker. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> says antitrust laws discourage cooperation of American companies, creating a barrier to more effective competition. `` It -LRB- should -RRB- be possible for high technology companies or other companies to get together, not only just research together, but develop and produce together and market together and then compete,'' he said. `` That's what has to happen if we're going to stay in some very important markets including the semiconductor market ... or high definition television, or super-conductivity, and there's much more coming down the path.'' This country has some marvelous technology, but it is less expert at transforming theoretical discoveries into products that can sell, he complained. `` The Japanese can do this two years quicker than we can,'' he said. `` This is a serious problem if we develop a technology but if the Japanese take our technology and use it and we're two years delayed in getting into the marketplace ... That's going to be disastrous to this country.'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION>'s criticism of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry was not the first from a high figure in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who was deputy to former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, has criticized what he called a `` corpocracy'' in American business for what he saw as lack of initiative. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is to be secretary of State under President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> will head the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>.

 Singer-songwriter <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, brain-damaged from shooting, was ordered Friday to undergo psychiatric evaluation by a judge who may appoint a guardian for the `` Ballad of the Green Berets'' singer. Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> filed a restraining order preventing <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> from being moved against his will from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, and said <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> must be evaluated by Jan. 20 to determine if he is competent to make his own decisions. The judge said he will decide after the evaluation if the court has jurisdiction to make <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s mother his guardian. `` If he is competent, maybe we do n't need a guardian,'' said <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s 24-year-old son, <PERSON> Thor </PERSON>, would be allowed to visit his father Friday. The 48-year-old author and singer-songwriter, whose `` Ballad of the Green Berets'' was a No. 1 hit in 1966, is at the center of competing legal bids from his mother and son to become his guardian. A judge in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday named <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> as temporary guardian, but <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said that judge agreed Friday to the psychiatric evaluation. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, who was shot in the head in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in September, checked out of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> hospital Sunday against medical advice. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> left after he learned hospital officials planned to send him back to a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> hospital, said his attorney, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Meissner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> said, `` 30 percent of his brain was destroyed when the bullet went through it. ...

 Authorities have identified <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as a possible destination for a planned illegal shipment of nerve gas, but the final arrival point may never be known, a <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` We do n't have to know -LRB- it -RRB- to make a case'' against two men charged Thursday with trying to export the deadly gas, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON>, head customs investigator in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. Prosecutors must only prove that the Korean-American and British business men tried to circumvent licensing requirements in exporting restricted materials, he said Friday. The charge carries a maximum five-year prison term and a $ 250,000 fine. `` I'm hopeful that through investigation, or whatever else,'' the destination would be positively determined, <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> said. But he pointed out that the deal never went through. `` It's not as though there's a trail for us to follow,'' he said. Authorities said Friday they are trying to learn the identities of two other people accused of plotting with the suspects. <PERSON> Juwhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, 48, was arrested Thursday at what he thought would be a meeting with an arms supplier, who was actually a <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent. He has been ordered jailed pending a bail hearing Tuesday on charges of conspiring to illegally export sarin, a nerve gas. An arrest warrant was issued for <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> businessman who authorities said was seeking to obtain the gas _ $ 5 million worth in the form of 500 quarter-ton bombs _ from <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>. The possibility of his extradition is being studied, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors said. The complaint filed in federal court accusing <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> said the men met Jan. 9 about the gas deal with two other people in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` During the course of the meeting, <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> called the undercover agent twice and asked him for more detailed information about the sarin,'' the complaint said. The complaint also detailed discussions between <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> and K.Y. <PERSON> Joo </PERSON>, identified as a close business associate of <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> and the head of <ORGANIZATION> Kwang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Authorities said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joo </PERSON> discussed at least three missile and military radar equipment deals that apparently involved <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as a destination. Authorities also said that at one point during negotiations <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was to be the recipient of the sarin.

<HEAD>Death Toll Up 352 On Highways With 65 mph Limit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rural interstate highway accidents killed 352 more people than a year earlier in states where the speed limit was raised to 65 mph, while death tolls on other roads decreased slightly, according to a government report. The 19 percent increase in deaths occurred over a period that varied for each state, depending on when drivers were allowed to go faster, said the report Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Congress authorized the increased limit beginning April 2, 1987, and 38 states have adopted it for their rural interstates. Highway deaths in those states on urban interstates and other roads where the 55 mph limit remained totaled 21,366 for the same period in 1986 and 21,231 in 1987, the report said. Fatalities in states that raised the speed limit increased by an average nearly three times as high as in 10 states that kept the limit at 55 on all roads, the report showed. But the safety administration, in releasing the first of three planned annual reports, said there were `` substantial variations'' among the states and some such as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> actually showed fewer deaths on rural interstates after new speeds were posted. The report also said there was not enough evidence to determine the speed limit's long-term impact on highway safety. Critics of the higher speed limit said the increased death toll was enough reason to return to the 55 mph limit nationwide. `` This report can be summed up in two words: speed kills,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations transportation subcommittee, who has opposed the increase. Overall, 373 more people died on rural interstates in 1987 than in 1986, the report said. Of those, 352 were in states that raise the speed limit and 21 in states that did not. The highway safety agency, in its 67-page report, said rural interstate fatalities account for only 5 percent of Americans killed in road accidents, and the increase had only a small impact on overall traffic fatalities which total about 46,000 a year. The report noted that 24,000 people are killed each year in crashes where alcohol is involved and 8,000 are pedestrians hit by vehicles. `` <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> continues to believe that setting speed limits is a matter for state legislatures to decide based on their review of available fatality and injury data, actual experience and local conditions,'' the report said. It noted that <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> experienced large increases in fatalities after raising the limit to 65 but states that did not also had significant increases. They include <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. States that increased the speed limit to 65 and had overall decreases in traffic fatalities included <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Ruling Against US News Retirees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 200 retirees of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report have lost another round in their court claim that they were underpaid $ 100 million in profit-sharing benefits. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Friday upheld a lower court decision that said the retirees were paid a fair value for their company stock before 1982, even though employees who held stock when the news magazine was sold two years later received much more per share. The 230 plaintiffs, who retired between 1974 and 1982, were paid an average of $ 100 a share, said their attorney, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Raywid </PERSON>. The magazine's 1984 employees got $ 2,842 a share when <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> was sold, according to court papers. `` We think the opinion is wrong,'' said <PERSON> Raywid </PERSON>, who added there is a `` substantial likelihood'' it will be appealed. The three-member court effectively said companies `` can sacrifice the interests of past employees and retirees'' to benefit current and future employees and maintain employee ownership, he said. Under the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> profit-sharing plan, when an employee retired the company could exercise its option to buy the employee's stock shares. According to court papers, employees who retired in 1973 received $ 65 a share, while the value rose to $ 470 for those who retired in 1981. The magazine was sold for $ 176 million in 1984 to media and real estate magnate <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Raywid </PERSON> said the plaintiffs had received a total of $ 5.5 million for their stock but believed they would have gotten $ 100 million more if they had been given full value. The plaintiffs contended the company that appraised the magazine's value improperly classified retirees' stock as a minority interest rather than a majority interest, which would have carried a higher premium. In addition, the plaintiffs said the appraiser placed an unfairly low value on property <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> owned in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the decision to give the retirees' stock a minority status, saying it was `` entirely consistent'' with the profit-sharing plan's rules and with federal law. The court also affirmed the property valuation, saying much of the land was being used as a parking lot and development had not been expected at the time. A major objective of the profit-sharing plan was the perpetuation of employee ownership, the appellate court said, adding that the law does not set an exclusive goal of maximizing benefits. `` The plaintiffs were not the only beneficiaries of the plan,'' the judges said. `` Indeed, the worst that can be said of the plan is that it was administered to favor a rolling class of future beneficiaries over those present and past.'' Ruling in the case were Circuit Judges <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Bomb Threat Against White House Minutes Before Reagan Arrival</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s helicopter landed at the White House minutes after a bomb threat was received by a White House operator, an administration aide said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, returning late Friday from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on the last working trip of his presidency, landed on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> on schedule at 11:15 p.m. EST after the Secret Service went over the area with bomb-sniffing dogs. The president entered the executive mansion without incident, White House press aide <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Sowry </PERSON> said. About 15 reporters and television crew members, on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> to cover the usually-routine helicopter landing, were removed to the White House press office moments before the presidential helicopter arrived. Press officials on duty had no information about the exact nature of the threat or whether it was actually directed at the White House complex. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was returning from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he had spoken at the annual dinner of the Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, a Roman Catholic civic organization that helps the poor. It was his last official working trip out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as president. Aides at the White House did not know if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been informed of the threat. Secret Service officials could not immediately be reached for comment. `` Several minutes before the helicopter was supposed to land the White House operator received a bomb threat and passed that on to the Uniformed Division -LRB- of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Sowry </PERSON> said. `` When the president landed, the place had already been swept.'' Earlier, during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a man who said he had a package for the president was detained at the <LOCATION> Waldorf-Astoria </LOCATION> while police and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials inspected the package and others in his car.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fearing a loss of the nation's competitive edge, a group of college officials is seeking ways to double the number of students studying abroad and include more business and science majors. Members of the Council on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> met privately in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday to discuss ways to expand study-abroad opportunities for less-affluent youngsters and encourage students to attend programs in places other than just <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The meeting followed release of a council report in December which found fewer than 5 percent, or about 50,000, of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> college students studying abroad each year, while some 350,000 foreign students attend <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools. `` Citizens of other nations are learning more about us than we are about them and each year are doing so in increasing numbers,'' said the 28-page report, `` Educating for Global Competence.'' `` We have quite rightly welcomed these students to our own shores but have failed to encourage our own students to go abroad,'' it said. The report warned that failure to expand study-abroad opportunities would mean `` we will irreversibly diminish the world status of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodbury </PERSON>, chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> system, said in an interview that the council decided to establish a Committee on Unrepresented Groups to help schools develop study-abroad opportunities for such groups as business and law students, and poor and minority youngsters. `` We plan to get poor students better information on what the costs are,'' <PERSON> Woodbury </PERSON> said after the meeting. `` There's a common belief that study-abroad progams will cost more. In fact, many programs do not involve extra cost.'' According to the report, only 3 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high school graduates and 5 percent of college graduates have meaningful proficiency in a second language. Thirty-three states do n't require foreign language study in high school, and 34 states do n't require world history. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is one of the few industrialized countries where students can graduate from college without studying a foreign language. `` If you look at the attitude of colleges here, international study has never been a very big part of the curriculum. It's just a ` good thing to do,' rather than a part of the mainstream,'' said <PERSON> Woodbury </PERSON>. The majority of students studying abroad are white, affluent females from highly educated families, according to the report. Most are liberal arts majors and spend less than six months in foreign programs. Relatively few students majoring in business, public health, science or math take part in such programs, said the report. <PERSON> Woodbury </PERSON> said his own school started an exchange program with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1987 involving 15 Soviet and 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students each year. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> system is also trying to establish an exchange program in which business students could work as interns in Japanese companies, he said. The council, established in 1947, is a non-profit organization based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> which fosters student exchange programs. Former <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulbright </PERSON> serves as honorary chairman.

<HEAD>Cross-Wiring Check Ordered For Boeing 757s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cross-wiring found in cargo hold emergency systems of two <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 airliners prompted federal aviation authorities to order inspections of all the aircraft within the next three days. The order late Friday was similar to one issued for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s 48 hours earlier involving critical engine fire and vibration warning systems. The two `` airworthiness directives'' were unrelated, however. The earlier order was prompted by speculation the pilot of a British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> 737 that crashed Sunday, killing 44 people, might have been confused by false wiring into shutting down his only good engine. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> reported Friday, however, that investigators were certain there was no wiring problem, and neither <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nor British airline officials reported finding such a problem on any other aircraft. Tests of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 737s have to be completed by Sunday morning. The latest `` airworthiness directive'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> gives airlines 72 hours to check whether cross-wiring in cargo holds might cause sprinklers to go on in the wrong cargo area in the event of a fire. The problem had been discovered in two of the aircraft, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. He said no details were available on how the problem was found or on which airliners, but he said neither involved an actual fire or accident. The order involving 757s `` is not really relevant to the British crash except that the subject is also miswiring,'' <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said 205 of the 757s are in service worldwide, with 119 of them used by four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines: <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>. `` The miswiring means that if the flight crew got a warning indicating a fire in the forward cargo compartment and pushed the button to activate the fire extinguishing system for that compartment, it would activate the system in the aft cargo compartment,'' and vice-versa, said an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> statement. The checks were not expected to disrupt any scheduled flights.

The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, citing a congressional source, reported Thursday that Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the ethics committee, had written <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> asking him to explain his hiring of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, the son of Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill According to the source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> what duties <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> performed, and if <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> had regularly reported to work. A federal investigation into the case began last month after The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> was on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll at the same time he was running for the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> legislature. According to sworn affidavits submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said he had fulfilled state requirements by living continuously for two years in the legislative district he sought to represent. That period covered the time he was on FauntrAroll. House rules, meanwhile, require a congressional employee to report regularly to work. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, in a statement he issued to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, disputed the portion of the story that described <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s letter According to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> asserted that <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> had not written him about the Savage affair. But the congressional source, contacted again by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> iso denial, on Friday reconfirmed and amplified his original description of the letter. The source stated a letter from <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> was received by <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s office during the last week of December, and added that <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s staff director, had been preparing a response However, it could not be learned whether <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> completed his letter, whether <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> had seen it, or whether a response had been sent to the Ethics panel. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s staff refused repeated efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> _ which included several telephone calls to <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s office and a visit there by a reporter _ to obtain the statement, Repeated efforts to reach <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> Friday were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the staff director of <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office, said the congressman was traveling out of state and would not return to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> until Wednesday. She said he had not left a telephone number where he could be reached, and had not been calling in for messages. Savage earned $ 21,398 while on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll from September 1987 through June 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a preliminary investigation into the case, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official confirmed Thursday. In the prepared statement, <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> also said his staff had been told by members of <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s personal office staff and Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> officials that no such letter existed. Ethics committee officials were unavailable for comment Friday afternoon. Neither <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, legislative director in <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> office, nor <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> press secretary, could be reached for comment

 A poor man and his wife went to the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s human rights agency for help and were handed 400 pesos, the equivalent of $ 1.30.

 Hundreds of Nicaraguans and other Central Americans seeking a promised land are pouring into this haven for immigrants, but some who settled in the area after the 1979 Sandinista revolution are wary of the newcomers. `` Some of the Nicaraguans here have mixed feelings about those who stayed with the Sandinistas,'' said <PERSON> Maritza </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are people from the farm areas, with a different orientation,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallais </PERSON>, a Nicaraguan priest who runs the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. The Central Americans began arriving from southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by the busload Thursday and Friday following a federal judge's ruling that the government could not keep them there while their applications for political asylum were being processed. Since the judge's decision Monday, some 400 people have come here, bringing the two-month total to about 2,000, most of them Nicaraguans. Officials expect about 100,000 more over the next 18 months. <PERSON> Pallais </PERSON> said the new group is different from the first wave of Nicaraguans that settled in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguello </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, disagreed, saying the time has come to forget the differences that separate the first group from the second. `` The bottom line is we are all Nicaraguans,'' he said. `` Back in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, there was no in-between. Here we just have to forget it. ... The objective is to help all Nicaraguans.'' The latest group is coming to town with no guarantee of food, shelter or social services, and officials are warning there will be very little support once they arrive. <PERSON> Isidoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON>, the Cuban-born mayor of <LOCATION> Sweetwater </LOCATION>, a heavily Nicaraguan city in western <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said his city will have trouble absorbing the aliens. `` We've been trying to gather clothes and food to pass it on to them,'' he said. `` But there are many dwellings shared by more than one family already. People are sleeping on the front porches, sleeping on the couches.'' In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, about 250 immigrants have been staying in a sports stadium, but the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> baseball team arrives Jan. 25 for spring training, and the immigrants will have to be relocated, most likely to private shelters and churches. Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> sought an emergency meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and other officials urged President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is fishing in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> this weekend, to come to see the situation for himself. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he would examine immigration policy when he takes office. He said the newcomers are `` causing an overburdening of facilities like schools and hospitals, and this is a sorry commentary on what's happening in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has to be generous, but no one community can suffer an overload without some support in some way,'' he said. A delegation of community leaders visited southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Friday to warn those awaiting transportation to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` If people come down there -LRB- <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> -RRB-, they need to know that they're going to have to fend for themselves,'' <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Assistant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Manager <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He estimated the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area has 75,000 to 125,000 Nicaraguans, along with thousands of other recently arrived Central Americans. More than 30,000 Central Americans passed through south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in 1988 seeking political asylum, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The best way for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to deal with the influx would be to allow more of the immigrants to get work permits, <PERSON> Arguello </PERSON> said. `` With work permits for every Nicaraguan, the private sector can step in and help,'' he said. `` We do n't want to create a welfare society.''

 A Teamsters international vice president, convicted of embezzling union funds in an alleged `` ghost employee'' scheme, returns to court Tuesday to learn whether he must relinquish his many union positions. Indicted in May 1986 with the late Teamsters President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, 66, was convicted in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday of embezzlement, labor racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering and filing false statements with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He could be sentenced to up to 46 years in prison and fined up to $ 70,000. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 52, recording secretary of Local 507 in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s home local, was convicted of labor racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering and embezzlement. He faces a penalty of up to 45 years imprisonment and a fine of up to $ 60,000. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, who became president of the 1.6-million member union in 1983, died of brain cancer July 9 and was never tried. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> declined comment after the verdict. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s most powerful Teamster, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, leader of <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 41 in northeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and president of Teamsters Local 507 and Bakery Workers Local 19. The two locals share offices and have a combined membership of about 12,000 people. Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> dismissed the jury until Tuesday. At that time, attorneys say, the jurors will be asked to consider whether the two men have to forfeit their union posts. No sentencing was scheduled. Union officials convicted of any of several felonies, including embezzlement, are required to relinquish their union positions for 13 years, according to <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Crino </PERSON>, area administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cambria </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, said other things are considered and that the jury will deliberate those points Tuesday. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> had been accused of being involved in embezzling $ 700,000 from the union between 1972 and 1981 to pay so-called `` ghost employees'' who did n't work for the money. <PERSON> Cambria </PERSON> said the verdict is puzzling because under the racketeering counts, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> was convicted only of keeping two of four alleged `` ghost employees'' on the payroll for three pay periods. The racketeering counts that <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> was convicted of accused <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> of embezzling up to $ 43,500 to pay <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and up to $ 8,800 to pay <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Argie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> was accused of being a `` ghost employee,'' and <PERSON> Argie </PERSON> was an unindicted co-conspirator who testified he did little, if any, work. `` I ca n't really make sense of the verdict at this point,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cambria </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We're going to have to determine if it -LRB- the verdict -RRB- can be set aside because it was internally inconsistent.'' <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> were <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informants, court documents indicated. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s former attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON>, has said that <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s defense would have been that he was authorized by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to hire the `` ghost employees'' to enhance and protect his image as an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant. During the trial, <PERSON> White </PERSON> rejected <LOCATION> Cambria </LOCATION>'s motion asking that documents regarding <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant activities be released. `` We were deprived from putting in the entire <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> aspect of this because <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> took that with him and the agents who are still alive declined to testify,'' <PERSON> Cambria </PERSON> said. One of <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' attorneys, <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, said he thought there were `` several inconsistencies'' in the verdict and declined to elaborate.

 A West German company that <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> officials contend exported goods to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to help it build a suspected chemical weapons plant is being investigated by a <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> prosecutor. The new probe compounds official embarrassment over a scandal that has dominated West German politics for two weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s vice chairman, <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, called Friday for a federal criminal probe. Government officials conceded Friday they had received intelligence reports in October that indicated German companies may have helped build the plant in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, about 40 miles outside the Libyan capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON>, had said earlier <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> knew nothing of alleged West German complicity in the project until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> brought it up during <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in November. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends the plant is on the verge of full-scale production of poison gas. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> claims it is a pharmaceutical plant. At the same news conference at which <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> spoke, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Driesch </PERSON> said investigators had found no evidence against West German companies that would stand up in court. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Botz </PERSON>, chief prosecutor for the <LOCATION> Offenburg </LOCATION> region in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> area, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he opened the new investigation into Imhausen-Chemie of <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON> after reading a detailed report in this week's Stern magazine. The Hamburg-based magazine cited what it said were official documents and witnesses in its article, which accused Imhausen-Chemie, the now defunct I.B.I. Engineering of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsao </PERSON> medical supply of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> of being deeply involved in the <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> project. Stern alleged that Imhausen-Chemie provided `` everything that is needed to build a chemical plant'' to I.B.I., which the magazine said in turn shipped the materials to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> under forged bills. The article also mentioned involvement by the <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> firm of <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. The director of that company, <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Gedopt </PERSON>, was arrested in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Wednesday and charged with forging shipping documents on goods delivered to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. A woman who answered the telephone at <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen-Chemie </ORGANIZATION> on Friday said the company would have no comment on the new developments. Attempts to reach the company's owner, <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippenstiel-Imhausen </PERSON>, were unsuccessful. News reports have said <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> is on a foreign business trip. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Thursday said authorities had uncovered new documents implicating West German companies and said investigators were giving them a thorough look. West German law requires companies exporting hazardous materials, arms or their components to obtain licenses from the <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. However, officials from that ministry have said the legal situation regarding transfer of technology or consultation varies from case to case. A West German delegation was in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the past week to examine <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s evidence on the plant's purpose and alleged West German involvement. Nearly two weeks ago, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they suspected Imhausen-Chemie. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> audited the company and announced last week it had found no evidence of illegal exports. On Wednesday, government sources confirmed a criminal investigation of I.B.I.'s activities and said customs authorities had seized company documents.

 Triskaidekaphobiacs worried about Friday the 13th. Everybody should beware this weekend, a psychic says. Triskaidekaphobiacs are people who are afraid of the number 13.

She said the alignment of the sun and moon would cause fights between couples, especially if one of them was born on a `` bad'' day _ most of which fall between the 15th and 19th of December, January, February, April and June. `` Those people could be in a lot of trouble,'' she said. `` A person born on a bad day is going to have a really bad day when the planets and the stars are wrong. With this weekend looking the way it is, right after Friday the 13th, I'd say stay indoors and watch yourself.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiritualist </PERSON>, who bills herself as `` A True Psychic,'' was optimistic. She said Friday the 13th had no more likelihood of bestowing bad luck on people than July 7, 1977, or 7-7-77, had of bringing good luck. `` It's just another day,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Spiritualist </PERSON> said. `` People should n't worry about things like that.

A symposium was planned Sunday and Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> to honor King's work. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, speaker of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Assembly </LOCATION>, was to give the keynote address Sunday and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a close associate of King's, was scheduled to speak Monday. The end of King day will be marked by a candlelight peace march at <LOCATION> Roeper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, a wealthy northern suburb of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, 26 teen-agers moved into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> consulate Friday for a weekend anti-apartheid protest to mark King's birthday. The students, none of them black and ranging in age from 13 to 19, occupied a hallway outside the consulate's third-floor office, singing songs such as `` We Shall Overcome'' and other protest anthems. The crowd blocked at least one person from entering. They said they would camp in the hallway until Monday, when fellow protesters planned a march at the building to commemorate King's birthday and to denounce <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial segregation. The mural unveiled Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was inspired after a student at the school was killed in 1987. Ten students painted, kept journals and did research about non-violence for the 10-month project. `` This is a world they'd like to change and make more peaceful,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, the school principal. The mural depicts Indian peace leader <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a sign saying `` end segregation in public schools'' and two hands shaking, one black, one white. In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, federal and city offices will be closed Monday but all state offices will remain open. King's birthday was a state holiday in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> for a brief time. Former Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, a Democrat, created the holiday by executive order in 1986 after the Legislature refused to act. But, as one of his first official acts as governor, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> rescinded the order before the first holiday could be celebrated. The action touched off the first major controversy of his short-lived administration. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said he acted because Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, a fellow Republican, had said that <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s order was illegal because a holiday requires legislative approval as well. Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> following his impeachment and removal from office last year, is on record in favor of a King holiday, although she has not followed <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> in creating one by executive order.

 <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who was sentenced to one year in jail for shooting four black men in a subway with an unlicensed gun, says the violence resulted from `` the deterioration of society.'' The 41-year-old electronics engineer was also ordered Friday to pay a $ 5,000 fine by state Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> had shown no remorse for his actions. `` I do feel this case is really more about the deterioration of society than it is about me,'' said <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, whose 1984 shootings of the men he said were trying to rob him prompted debates on racism, self-defense and vigilantism. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Waples </PERSON> `` seemed, I'm sorry to say, to believe that society needs to be protected from me,'' <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> said. `` Well, I do n't believe that's the case,'' he said. `` I believe society needs to be protected from criminals.'' <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> after the shootings and later surrendered. He told police he fired the .38 - caliber revolver in self-defense because he felt he was about to be robbed; the men claimed they were Three of the four, all 19 at the time, recovered from the shooting. One, <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabey </PERSON>, was left brain-damaged and partially paralyzed. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was acquitted of attempted murder and other charges in his June 1987 trial. An appeals court upheld the gun possession conviction last year, but threw out the original six-month jail sentence, saying it did not meet the requirements under state law, which mandates a one-year sentence. Under the one-year jail sentence, <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> gets credit for the nine days he served immediately after his arrest, becoming eligible for parole in 51 days. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who faced a new sentence of up to seven years, decided to go ahead with the sentencing even though he has asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review the case because he wants to get the jail time over with, said his attorney, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. His other attorney, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Slotnick </PERSON>, had asked the judge to limit <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s sentence to the nine days he already served, pleading, `` Let him go home where he belongs. ... He has lived in a fish bowl and he should not go to jail.'' The prosecutor said <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> `` richly deserves to be punished'' and called him `` a potential danger to himself and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> society.'' <PERSON> Waples </PERSON> sought a one-year sentence with supervised parole so <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> would be forced to undergo psychiatric treatment. <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s failure to show remorse for the crime `` gave me concern he might recidivate in possessing a firearm'' and added that a jail term `` would not be unduly harsh.'' <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> left immediately for the <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> jail. The <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a defense request that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> be kept in protective custody there, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. Two jurors from <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s trial attended Friday's sentencing: <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>, a college librarian, and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Serpe </PERSON>, an airline reservations clerk. `` We felt we were so intensely involved and we had to follow it through,'' said <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>. `` The problem is, it is the law, and as it is the law, we feel it has to be followed or a signal is sent that the law does n't mean anything.'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>, a lawyer representing <PERSON> Cabey </PERSON> in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, called the sentence an outrage and said it `` gives license to bigots and lunatics all over the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to go out and blast people who they hate and fear.'' `` I have spoken to Mrs. <PERSON> Cabey </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON>'s mother -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> said. `` She expected this but she is disappointed. She was hoping a stiff sentence would prevent other people from going out and doing to black youth what <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> did to <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabey </PERSON>. Unfortunately, that's not going to happen.''

<HEAD>Chinese Artists Reunite 10 Years After Unprecedented Exhibit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten years after their avant-garde exhibition in a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> park shook up the Chinese art world, a group of pioneering artists has reunited in this British colony for their first retrospective. The youthful Chinese artists, known as `` The Stars,'' gained prominence in 1979 when they marched through <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to protest police interference in a show they had set up without official approval. The authorities gave in and permitted the exhibition, unprecedented in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which featured once-forbidden topics such as nudes, abstracts and works of aesthetic rather than political content. After a 1980 show, however, the 30-member group disbanded. While some remained active in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, others settled in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The retrospective, featuring the work of 12 group members, opened Friday and is scheduled to run five weeks before moving to <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Before `` The Stars,'' `` earlier art was all the same,'' said sculptor <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Keping </PERSON>, one of six members in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for the exhibition. `` The Stars'' showed artistic activity in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> need not be organized or approved by the ruling party, he said. Individuality was the driving force behind the group, said gallery owner <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsong-zung </PERSON>, who organized the retrospective. `` The only common aim of the artists when they first started was that they wanted to be different from each other.'' <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, a teacher at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and Design whose abstract scroll paintings are part of the retrospective, claims artistic freedom in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has advanced since the group's 1979 exhibition though limitations remain. There is no problem, he said, `` if you use a work of art to satirize an opponent of the government. But if you mock the government, I'm afraid that will pose a problem.'' `` The Stars'' also say <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> no longer allows them to exhibit as a group, thwarting attempts in 1983 and 1986. The reason, believes <PERSON> Bo </PERSON>, is that the group's name has become a symbol of the democracy movement. The retrospective includes works from the late 1970s, including <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s Buddha-like bust of Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> signifying the deification of the Communist leader during the ultraleftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. It is called `` The Idol.'' Other pieces adopt current themes, including the mixed-media work `` Safe Sex'' by Ai Weiwei that features a prophylactic attached to a rain coat. The works, which cost up to several thousand dollars, are as different as the paths the artists have taken since they disbanded. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, 39, a soft-spoken man with a small goatee, moved to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1984, convinced he could not develop further in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> largely because of political pressure. `` Art freedom is only possible in a democratic country with human rights,'' he said. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> recently wrote a play titled, `` The Retrial of <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>,'' who led a pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> before being sentenced to a 15-year prison term in 1979. <PERSON> Bo </PERSON>, 40, has remained in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, supplementing his $ 40 monthly salary by selling his paintings to foreigners and at overseas exhibits. Other `` Stars'' on display in the retrospective include <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Rui </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Desheng </PERSON>, the two leaders of the group, and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuang </PERSON>, who was arrested in 1981 and sentenced to two years of labor re-education for `` incitement to debauchery.'' When she was arrested, she was living with a French diplomat but had yet to marry him. Although `` The Stars'' have scattered across the globe they have stayed in touch with one another. From the heady days of 1979-80 was forged `` a feeling of brotherhood'' that has not diminished, <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Defense Rests In Trial Of Man Accused In Daughter's Beating Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The defense rested in the murder trial of <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, accused of beating to death his illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter, without introducing an insanity defense and without calling him to testify. During 11 weeks of testimony, the jury heard 39 prosecution witnesses and 13 defense witnesses. State Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> scheduled the defense summation for next Thursday. He told the jurors the government would sum up next Friday and they would get the case on Jan. 23 after receiving the judge's instructions. With the jury absent, <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> again asked <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyers, <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> DiLuzio </PERSON>, `` Am I correct you do not intend to introduce an insanity defense?'' `` You are 100 percent correct, your honor,'' DiLuzio replied. <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> had repeatedly pressed <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyers to tell him if they intended to argue that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was not responsible for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s death by reason of mental defect or disease. In case they did, the judge had ordered the defendant to be examined by a prosecution psychiatrist to determine his mental condition on Nov. 1, 1987, the night he is accused of fatally beating <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. The examination was completed Thursday night. The judge said if the defense made any reference in their summation next week to <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> being motivated by `` cults, staring, or that he heard electronic mousetraps in the walls of his apartment'' that would be tantamount to introducing an insanity defense. If that happened, the judge said, he would reopen the trial and let the prosecution psychiatrist testify. The decision by the defense not to use an insanity defense leaves the jury with a circumstantial case in which no one said they saw <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> killed. <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s former live-in companion, testified that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told her he struck <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> because the child was `` staring at him and trying to place him in a hypnotic trance.'' Both <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, were charged with second-degree murder for `` depraved indifference'' to <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s life. Charges against Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> were dismissed in October, at the request of the prosecution, which says she was too battered and emotionally crippled to harm <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, but the defense challenges that contention. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> told reporters outside the courtroom that the prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, a disbarred lawyer, inflicted the injuries that killed <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. He continued to suggest that the injuries could have been inflicted by Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>. `` We hope that issue has been squarely raised and will be considered'' by the jury, he said.

 A man who tipped federal agents to the whereabouts in 1981 of an escaped spy has been charged with murder in the death of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officer during a shootout near this northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> town. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, 27, and his brother <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 29, surrendered to authorities shortly after Thursday's gun battle in which <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> was killed. Authorities had tracked the men in rugged, snowy terrain for nearly a day after a botched house robbery Wednesday night. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> received a reward for turning in <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, who had escaped from a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison in 1980 and had been living in a remote area of northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> near the Canadian border for 19 months. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> had been serving a 40-year sentence for his conviction in 1977 of selling <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> satellite information to the Soviets. He was recaptured Aug. 21, 1981, in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> has been chronicled in two books by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, `` The Falcon and the Snowman,'' which was made into a motion picture, and its sequel, `` The Flight of the Falcon. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> and a third brother, <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, received immunity from prosecution for their testimony against <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> at his 1982 trial on conspiracy and bank robbery charges. The Pratts testified they had taken part in a series of robberies that <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> masterminded in 1980 and 1981 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> pleaded guilty to 10 counts of conspiracy, bank robbery and firearms violations a week into the trial. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> was charged Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Bonner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> with first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first-degree murder, first-degree burglary, robbery, two counts of second-degree kidnapping, and two counts of aggravated assault. He was being held without bond in the <LOCATION> Bonner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> was under guard at <ORGANIZATION> Bonner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> following surgery for a gunshot wound to his leg. Arraignment was scheduled Monday on the same charges as his brother, said Prosecutor <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. Police said Wednesday's botched home robbery netted $ 12. As officers arrived, the men sped away, firing several times at a pursuing vehicle. The gunmen abandoned their car after it ran into a snowbank, then fled on foot into the woods. Officers from several agencies tracked the men Wednesday night, resuming the search at daybreak Thursday in knee-deep snow drifts, police said. <ORGANIZATION> Bonner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roos </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> was killed just as tracking teams were being recalled because of darkness. The gunmen apparently fled to a home about a mile away. There, about 1 -LCB- hours later, a call was placed to the sheriff's office, and one of the men said they were ready to surrender, <PERSON> Roos </PERSON> said.

 Forty-eight policemen will have to settle for a job well done instead of the expensive watches they received from the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> in gratitude for guarding him. `` It was not deemed correct that officials receive extra compensation for fulfillment of their normal duties,'' said an <LOCATION> Aachen </LOCATION> police spokesman.

The new police chief, <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Boenninghausen </PERSON>, has decided the watches should be auctioned off with the money to go to charity, the spokesman said. Two of the policemen have filed a court complaint asking that they be allowed to keep their watches, he said. The administrative court has issued a restraining order on the auctioning off the watches to study the case, the spokesman said.

 Doctors at the nation's leading transplant center have stopped doing multiple-organ abdominal transplants until they can find a better way of keeping the body from rejecting the organs. `` We're in no sense foreclosing the thing,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, who pioneered the surgery. `` We have an operation that's fundamentally sound But we do n't quite yet have the capability of bringing it off in a predictable and reliable way.'' <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>'s recommendation Friday to Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> not to perform any more of the experimental operations until anti-rejection drug therapy is improved came a week after the death of 3-year-old <PERSON> Rolandrea </PERSON> `` Rolly'' Dodge of <LOCATION> Fruitland </LOCATION>, N.M. The toddler died Jan. 6 in <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, six weeks after receiving a liver, pancreas, stomach, small intestine and part of a large intestine. Preliminary laboratory tests revealed similarities between the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> child's death and that of <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, the only other person to receive five transplanted organs in a single operation. The <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, girl survived six months before dying last May of a blood infection. `` We probably need better tools,'' <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said. `` We're looking ahead to getting better methods of controlling -LRB- organ -RRB- rejection.'' <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said doctors deliberately waited a year before proceeding with a second transplant involving multiple abdominal organs. They decided on <PERSON> Rolly </PERSON>, who was born with a disorder that prevented her intestines from absorbing food and liquids. Based on their experience with <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>, surgeons gave <PERSON> Rolly </PERSON> less cyclosporine, a potent anti-rejection medication. But her name was placed back on the transplant waiting list Jan. 4 when tests showed her small intestine was being rejected by her body's immune system. A suitable donor was never found and she died of multiple-organ failure. Tissue analyses on <PERSON> Rolly </PERSON> are incomplete, but doctors believe she and <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> suffered from a dangerous proliferation of white blood cells. The same problem also plagued <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Steward </PERSON>, 10 months, of <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who died last May following a four-organ transplant at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> `` This really troubles us a lot that this has popped up now in three of three cases,'' <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>'s concerns were not unanimous. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, director of transplantation at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hospital, said last week that he intended to procede with his multiple organ transplant program. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has performed two. Similarly, surgeons at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and Clinics in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> have shown no inclination of stopping their intestinal transplant program. The first person to undergo a multiple-abdominal organ transplant, a 6-year-old girl, lived only a few hours after <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>'s 1983 operation The second patient, a 17-month-old boy, survived three days in 1986 at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hospital. The string of failures is reminiscent of the early days of liver transplantation, said <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967. The one-year survival rate for liver transplant patients has since climbed to about 70 percent, according to <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Broznick </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The only surviving multiple organ recipient, 14-month-old <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliveira </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, received a small intestine and liver Dec. 31 at the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> hospital. He was in critical but stable condition Friday at the Madison hospital. Organ transplants are the only option for children like <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> with short gut syndrome, a potentially fatal intestinal deformity, according to <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> also had short gut syndrome.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> may postpone a visit by 60 Chinese `` war orphans'' from World War II who are scheduled to arrive the same day as Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral, officials said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is concerned that their arrival on Feb. 24 would focus attention on World War II tragedies while more than 100 foreign dignitaries take part in a state funeral for <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, news reports quoted ministry officials as saying. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died of cancer one week ago at age 87. The war orphans, the offspring of Japanese nationals who resided in northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manchuria </LOCATION> during <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, were left behind as infants in the turmoil following <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defeat in 1945 Since 1981, about 18 groups of orphans from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have come to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to search for their Japanese relatives. Officials at the National Olympics Memorial Youth Center, where the orphans would stay, said the government ministry had asked them if the facility would be available at a later date if the visit, originally scheduled for Feb. 24-March 10, is postponed. Under a 1988 agreement between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, about 100 orphans are scheduled to visit this year.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said solidarity among the cartel's 13 member nations was the main reason for a recent rise in oil prices, a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> newspaper reported today. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Nadwa </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> as saying in an interview that cooperation from non-OPEC oil producers along with dwindling stockpiles as demand rises, partly because of winter, also contributed to the increase. `` Solidarity of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member states after the last <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> conference is the most important reason -LRB- for the hike -RRB-, but this strength hinges primarily on the extent of adherence to the terms of the last agreement,'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> oil prices have risen more than $ 3 a barrel from a range of $ 11 - $ 15 a barrel since the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> introduced a Jan. 1 production quota of 18.5 million barrels a day Because of a glut on the world market, oil prices plunged as low as $ 10 a barrel in price swings over the past two years that rarely reached <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s target of an $ 18 benchmark price. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> told Al-Nadwa the price fluctuations were caused for reasons `` within and outside'' <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, in a reference to over-production by some cartel members in defiance of the quota system. `` It is when <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is hit by weakness and confusion that the stockpiles are used -LRB- to aggravate the glut -RRB- and this affects the price, but that rises the minute solidarity returns,'' he was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> admitted it was hard for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to determine the quantities stockpiled in order to balance the market with its output, but said all member nations were hopeful the $ 18 a barrel benchmark would prevail. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> left the Sultanate of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> today after holding talks with Oil Minister <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Shanfari </PERSON> in advance of a Jan. 26 meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC producers will try to coordinate policy on stabilizing prices. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> earlier had visited <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, which along with <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> is a non-OPEC producer that cooperates with the cartel.

He said the wheel was one of four on the right main landing gear. The cause of the mishap is under investigation. `` Everybody pretty much knew there was something wrong,'' said <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` Surprisingly, the landing was very smooth. Everyone was very calm. I was just very, very happy to hit ground, have the plane stop and get off the plane.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 was carrying 143 passengers and six crew members. There were no injuries, although the fallen wheel severely damaged a private plane parked at National Airport.

 The powerful <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> has been left with a leadership vacuum after the jailing of its longtime leaders on homicide and weapons charges. Leading analysts called the arrests a political move. Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have indicated more arrests are expected. The arrests this week of union boss <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> and 50 others, including its secretary-general, carried a message from new President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotari </PERSON> for other unions, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Excelsior </ORGANIZATION> said in a front-page column Friday. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was inaugurated last month. `` The dramatic arrest of -LRB- <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> -RRB- and his closest associates should be seen not as a normal legal action, as the attorney general is uselessly depicting it, but as a presidential decision, 100 percent political, which is covered by a thin veil of legality,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Colegio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, a graduate school and think tank. `` With the fall of -LRB- <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> -RRB-, all the labor and union leaders who emerged and prospered in the shadow of the state are placed at the disposition of the government and in quite a vulnerable position.'' <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantu </PERSON>, a government supporter, wrote in a column in <LOCATION> Excelsior </LOCATION>, `` It's not a legal but a political problem; not between the judicial power and the delinquents but between the old and new society in our country.'' Most of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s unions have been closely tied to the government. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> have been at odds since <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, as budget secretary, began cutting into the 200,000-member union's control of contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, the state oil monopoly The union long has been known to have weapons, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said.

 A Canadian Jewish group has asked the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to set up an international commission to trace a Swedish diplomat who disappeared in Soviet custody after saving thousands of Jews from the Holocaust. Many believe <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>, credited with saving 103,000 Jews in World War II, is still alive in a Soviet prison. If so, he would be 77. `` We're not confident we know everything that could be known,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Matas </PERSON>, vice president of B'nai B'rith <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, told reporters Friday. `` This would be a true test of the new Soviet policy of glasnost.'' When Soviet troops liberated <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in January 1945, <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON> was arrested for espionage and sent to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Soviets say he died of a heart attack in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> jail in 1947, but various Soviet dissident sources have reported seeing him this decade. <PERSON> Matas </PERSON> discussed the issue Friday with <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON>, minister-counselor of the Soviet Embassy. <PERSON> Matas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> called <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON> a hero and said he regrets what happened to him. B'nai B'rith asked the Soviets to appoint a commission of historians from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The commission members would interview surviving witnesses, review Soviet archives and make a public report. In 1944, <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON> volunteered for a mission to save Jews in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps, and is credited with saving the Jews from <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps by giving some Swedish passports, putting others in safe houses and pleading with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> officials to spare their lives.

 Gay and lesbian groups say they will seek other ways to oust a judge who said he gave a lighter sentence to a killer partly because the victims were `` queers'' if a state comission does n't take action. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> began its inquiry into state District Court Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Friday. The 11-member commission of judges and private citizens meets behind closed doors and does not discuss pending cases. `` We, at this point are going to let the commission do its job,'' said <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxey </PERSON>, executive director of the Lesbian Gay Rights Lobby of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But he said the commission's secret deliberations were a `` hideous situation.'' About two dozen protesters gathered outside the building where the commission met and called for <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s removal from the bench, but said should that fail, they could always find other ways. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, a Republican, is up for re-election in 1990. Last month, <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> said he sentenced 18-year-old <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bednarski </PERSON> to 30 years in prison instead of a maximum life sentence because the two men he killed were homosexuals. `` These two guys that got killed would n't have been killed if they had n't been cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bednarski </PERSON> was convicted of the murders of <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Trimble </PERSON>, 34, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, 27, who were found shot to death in a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> park. `` I do n't care much for queers cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys. I've got a teen-age boy,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> told the newspaper. His remarks sparked continuing protests from homosexual and civil liberties groups. `` It's absolutely intolerable to have a bigot use that kind of language when he's supposed to be in the business of dispensing equal justice,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyal </PERSON>, who heads one of several groups that have filed complaints against <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> with the commission. `` How can you preside and be fair to everyone if you do not have the same respect for all individuals?'' said <PERSON> Pellegrino </PERSON>, one of the protesters. The commission could dismiss the case, or it could impose sanctions ranging from a private warning to appointment of a special master by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to conduct a removal hearing. Commission Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Junell </PERSON>, a judge on the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> appeals court, said, `` We're here to do the job that the law calls on us to do.'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, who was not called to appear at the meeting, did not return telephone calls to The Associated Press.

 A probate judge has ordered a psychiatric evaluation of author, singer and songwriter <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, who suffered brain damage following a shooting in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, 48, whose `` Ballad of the Green Berets'' was a No. 1 hit in 1966, is at the center of a battle between his mother and his son, who both want to become his legal guardian. Cuyahoga County Probate Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> on Friday filed a temporary restraining order preventing <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> from being moved against his will from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said psychiatrist <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertschinger </PERSON> will evaluate <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> by Jan. 20 to determine whether he is competent to make his own decisions. `` He will remain at <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> until he wants to leave,'' <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said. The judge said he will decide after the evaluation whether the court has jurisdiction to appoint <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s mother as guardian. `` If he is competent, maybe we do n't need a guardian,'' said <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s 24-year-old son, <PERSON> Thor </PERSON>, would be allowed to visit his father. <LOCATION> Davidson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Probate Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday appointed the younger <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> as temporary guardian, but <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> agreed Friday to the psychiatric evaluation. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, who was shot in the head in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in September, checked out of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> hospital Sunday against medical advice. He left after learning that hospital officials planned to send him back to a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> hospital, said his attorney, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Meissner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> said 30 percent of his father's brain was damaged by the bullet. <PERSON> Meissner </PERSON> said Friday that <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> is mentally competent and wants his mother, <PERSON> Blanche </PERSON> <PERSON> Bebe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, appointed guardian to help him conduct his affairs. A hearing is set in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> on Wednesday on a petition filed Jan. 10 by <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Lavona </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, and children, <PERSON> Thor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>, asking the court to appoint one of them guardian and return <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police reports indicate <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> was shot by accident when a gun fell out of his pocket and went off while he was riding in a taxi, his son said. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> also is the author of more than 20 books, featuring <LOCATION> Casca </LOCATION>, a mercenary condemned to everlasting life until the Second Coming of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Government Appeals Court Ban On Falcon Crest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court overstepped its jurisdiction in finding the American television series Falcon Crest too degenerate for Egyptian viewers, said a government lawyer who was appealing the case today. `` If ... the plaintiff did n't like the series, all he needed to do was to switch off his television set,'' said <PERSON> Ragaee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Issa </PERSON>, the technical department chief of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. Usually shown weekly, the series about a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wine-making estate is highly popular in this Moslem country. The series stars <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamas </PERSON>. A court in the Nile Delta town of <LOCATION> Shibin </LOCATION> el-Kom banned the series last month after lawyer <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> argued that scenes in <LOCATION> Falcon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> are `` against morality and the constitution and incite debauchery.'' The court ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, to stop screening the series. Television ignored the ruling. On Sunday, it rebroadcast the last two episodes of the series' seventh season, and a day later showed the first episode of the new season. <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Litigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the government in civil court cases, appealed to a higher court at <LOCATION> Shibin </LOCATION> el-Kom. `` We expect to win,'' <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> said. `` We expect the -LRB- appeal -RRB- court to rule that the ban order was outside the jurisdiction of the court.'' Disputes with the government must be litigated only in the Cairo-based <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> also objected to the ruling because the judge accepted the plaintiff's allegations without making an independent court assessment. Falcon Crest began appearing several years ago and quickly gained popularity. Television censors routinely cut kissing scenes they consider too passionate.

The spokesman, <PERSON> Ruy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogueira </PERSON>, said the American commission made its proposals Friday to <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> during a private session at his official residence in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>.

But in a meeting Friday at the foreign ministry, one government representative told reporters it was `` unreasonable to insist that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> pull back its development programs in the name of protecting the environment. `` A developing country that has to create 1.7 million new jobs per year and service debt can not forgo the occupation of its territory,'' said the sub-secretary of foreign relations, <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tarso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flecha </ORGANIZATION> de <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is studying how best to commercially develop the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> without causing widespread ecological damage. But without debt relief from industrialized countries, occupying the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> in a `` rational manner'' would be difficult. `` The international community must assist us with debt relief, technical assistance and financial support,'' said Flecha de <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The issue of how to develop the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, an expanse of tropical forest about two-thirds the size of continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has taken on international significance.

Conservationists are worried about the `` greenhouse effect'' on global climate from uncontrolled burning in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> basin. The removal of oxygen-producing trees and release of noxious gases into the atmosphere, some experts say, raises the earth's temperature and could have been a factor in the summer 1988 drought in the Midwest

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> charged that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> troops today fired automatic weapons at one of its guardposts in the demilitarized zone separating the two countries. The North's official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> called the incident `` a grave armed provocation'' and said military officials had lodged a protest with the South. The news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said the weapons were deliberately fired by South Korean troops, `` gravely menacing the safety of civil policemen of our side.'' The protest `` denounced this armed provocation as a wanton violation of the armistice agreement and a premeditated provocation rendering the situation strained'' in the demilitarized zone, it said. The news agency did not provide any other details of the alleged incident. The two Koreas have remained enemies since the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended with an armistice but no formal peace treaty. Shooting incidents are reported several times each year along the highly militarized `` demilitarized zone'' that separates the two countries.

<TEXT>
 A high-ranking Vietnamese official arrived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> tonight for talks apparently aimed at settling the conflict in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The arrival of the man believed to be Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nho </PERSON> <PERSON> Liem </PERSON> marked the first time in more than nine years that high-ranking Chinese and Vietnamese officials will meet to discuss peace in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> arms guerrillas opposing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The official was greeted by Vietnamese and Chinese officials at the old <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, an airstrip reserved for senior government officials from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and abroad. The man then ducked into a <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> car which sped away. Vietnamese Ambassador <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON> <PERSON> Phuong </PERSON> followed in another car. Vietnamese Embassy officials and Chinese officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> refused to comment on the arrival. But <PERSON> Liem </PERSON>'s name was on the flight log of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> Flight No. 974 which flew out of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today. And Japanese journalists reported seeing him at the <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> airport. A top <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance official said this week that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, at the request of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, agreed to its first high-level talks with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> since late 1979. The deal also involved the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> opening direct talks with <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s son and representative in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> made the disclosures in a broadcast over the resistance radio Wednesday. He said either the Vietnamese minister of foreign affairs or a vice minister would travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in early February. It was not clear why <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had decided to hold the meeting earlier than scheduled. Thai officials said they knew about the meeting but would give no details. On Thursday, a <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would consider direct talks with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> `` at an appropriate time.'' He refused to elaborate. The direct talks between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> follow the initiation of talks in August between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on the Cambodian question, a major stumbling block for improving long-strained ties between the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> governments. In the 1960s and mid-70s, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> provided major assistance for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s war against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> have been cold since late 1978 when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> toppled the pro-Chinese <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The ultra-radical <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> had ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since 1975 in a bloody reign that left at least 1 million people dead. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> fought a border war in early 1979. Vice ministerial talks were held in May 1979 in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and December in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and then cut off. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> now arms guerrillas opposing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. One of the guerrilla groups is the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has long said that the first step to a solution to the conflict in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to withdraw its troops, and had refused to open direct talks with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> moves to end its decade-long occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. In recent months, signs have pointed to improved relations. On Jan. 7, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said a Vietnamese proposal to withdraw all of its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by September was a `` step forward.'' Earlier, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, facing serious economic problems at home, set a target of 1990 for leaving <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. In a speech Jan. 6, <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> <PERSON> Samrin </PERSON>, the Vietnamese-installed president of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would be out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by September if a political settlement to the conflict can be reached. In his proposal, <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> said his government still wanted measures to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from returning to power. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has refused to exclude the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from a future <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government but has said it is willing to reduce its assistance to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and other guerrillas forces as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> pulls out. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> claims it has made partial troop withdrawals each year since 1982. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> actually has only rotated forces in and out. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> claims it has about 50,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> say the actual number is far larger.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed back out on the waters of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> today on the last weekend before his Inauguration, intent on capturing what he called `` pound for pound'' the world's most formidable fighting fish. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reeled in a 13-lb. bonefish on Friday in his first foray this trip out on the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> side of the Keys, and regaled reporters with details of the exploit today as he pulled away from a private dock in a police boat. `` It really is excellent, just wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is on his third fishing or hunting trip since his election. The bonefish stripped off 150 yards of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s line before he reeled it in, took a picture and threw it back from the 17-foot skiff `` The Backlash'' that he fished from in the shallow waters. `` These are, pound for pound, I'd say, as fighting a fish as there is in the world,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Spotting tourists sitting on a narrow dock where reporters and photographers were recording his departure, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked where they were from. `` <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>,'' replied <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, a 52-year-old hairdresser from <LOCATION> Bournemouth </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>! Are you?'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Think <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> would like a little of this bonefishing action?'' The British visitor called the next president `` fantastic.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would leave work on his inaugural speech until he returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Sunday night. `` Not here,'' he said. `` When I get back we'll get to more seriousness on that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 13-pounder was just three pounds off the world record for bonefish, said spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. The vice president, an avid sportsman, told reporters at an impromptu news conference after <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two landed Friday at the airport in <LOCATION> Marathon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, that he hoped to enjoy 48 hours in `` splendid isolation'' to `` clear the mind for the decisions that lie ahead.'' He blamed a flood of refugees from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on `` tyranny'' in that Marxist state, and he promised `` a hard new look at immigration policy'' to help communities in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> overburdened with the refugees. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he is determined `` to focus all through my presidency on my determination to help get rid of chemical and biological weapons.'' He said the furor over the Libyan plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> has enhanced worldwide understanding of the problem. West German officials are now investigating a German company the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build a plant capable of making poison gas. `` I think the Germans had a chance to analyze this evidence, but I have never doubted Chancellor -LRB- <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s commitment to the control and the elimination of chemical weapons,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fishing buddies including Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>; Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeder </PERSON>, a transition adviser; Dr. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cancer doctor; and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> businessman and raconteur <PERSON> Alphonse </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. A local guide, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hommel </PERSON>, was leading the hunt from 17-foot, shallow-water skiffs. The three-day vacation is his third hunting or fishing trip since the election, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has no plans for a winter White House here. In fact, he said, `` There will be no winter or summer White Houses anyplace.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he envisions getting to his to his ocean home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, `` sometime, but the president is so beautifully taken care of with Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> and other arrangements that I have no intention of building something else.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he probably wo n't get back to the Keys this winter, but intends to fish often over the next eight years, proving `` I'm one of the classic fishing conservationists ... and demonstrating my keen personal interests in going after the wily bonefish, or the elusive tarpon or the redfish or the snook that may be lying up under that branch in the river up the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>.'' Asked if he favors a ban on oil leasing in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former oilman, said, `` What does that have to do with fishing?''

 Two Palestinian girls died today from bullet wounds suffered during clashes with Israeli troops, the army said, bringing to four the number of Palestinians killed by army gunfire in two days. Palestinian residents of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the largest city in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, staged a mourning strike, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> students left schools for marches to protest one of the killings, said an Arab reporter there. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports identified one of the victims as <PERSON> Hanadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Sultan </PERSON>. The military command said the 12-year-old died at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after being shot Jan. 10 in a clash at <LOCATION> Shati </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In an apparent effort to prevent disturbances, the army clamped a curfew on Shati, a beachside shantytown in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> housing 42,000 Palestinians. <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> merchants continued a commercial strike begun Friday to protest <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> raids to collect taxes. The strike was called by PLO-linked leaders of the 13-month uprising. Non-payment of taxes is a major tactic of the revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. In east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, 14-year-old <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Masri </PERSON> died of wounds from a Jan. 7 clash in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the army said. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said she was shot in the head with a plastic bullet. At least seven other <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers, aged 13 to 18, were wounded today in stone-throwing clashes with troops, doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Nasser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said. They included one teen shot in the chest and another transferred to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> in serious condition with a bullet wound to the head. On Friday, a 15-year-old Palestinian died in <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> of wounds from a Thursday clash with troops in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Nuseirat refugee camp. Another 15-year-old Arab boy was killed Friday at Dheishe refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, where dozens of youths hurled stones at troops who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and, finally, live ammunition. Today's deaths raise to at least 355 the number of Arabs killed in the uprising which started in December 1987. Fifteen Israelis have died.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Promises Afghan Government Continued Soviet Aid</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Najib, one word, is correct.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> promised that his nation will give <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s beleaguered government continued `` all-around assistance,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today. The official Soviet news agency's report on talks between <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> appeared to indicate <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will keep getting Soviet military aid, even after all Red Army troops leave the country. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> flew Friday to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s capital, as Soviet officials continued working for a political solution permitting them to withdraw their remaining 50,000 soldiers by Feb. 15. Soviet diplomats have hinted the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> may not complete with withdrawal by the deadline, which was set at U.N.-brokered negotiations in April 1988. Western diplomats, however, say the departure of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which was halted during the fall, has resumed. On Friday, reporters said 500 <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldiers laden with military equipment lined up before transport planes at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport, waiting to fly home. The Soviets tried but failed to involve rebels fighting <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government in peace talks with government representatives Rebel leaders say the Soviets only wanted to secure a place for Afghan Marxists in a new Afghan government. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> renewed the call for peace talks during his discussions with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, but also clearly aligned himself with the Afghan government, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report indicated. `` The Soviet side confirmed its intention to continue playing an intermediary role in launching a general dialogue in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The Soviet side confirmed its full support for the Afghan leadership's policies and said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will continue extending the Republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> all-round assistance under treaties and agreements concluded by the two countries,'' the news agency said. Since the Soviets committed themselves to an Afghan withdrawal, they have transferred millions of dollars worth of armaments and military supplies to their <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> allies, Western observers say. The Afghan government and the Soviets blame the guerrillas for continuing hostilities because they have refused to join a cease-fire proclaimed by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> on Jan. 1. Soviet troops marched into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to preside over the replacement of one Marxist leader by another, and the 100,000 soldiers stayed on to prop up the government against a nationwide insurgency.

 Laser surgery on an 8-foot boa constrictor's throat cancer turned a small university clinic into a media zoo. The 12-minute operation Thursday drew cameras and reporters from four television stations, an independent network and assorted newspapers to the <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>.

Just before the surgery, Dr. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldy </PERSON>, a veterinarian, held up the sleepy-looking boa and said: `` He's beginning to look a little stupid now.'' The photo opportunity set lights flashing and cameras whirring. The specialists took <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> into the operating room and stretched him out on the table. A TV reporter's crew failed to capture the scene on videotape. `` Why are n't we getting this?'' yelled the reporter, demanding that the entry scene be repeated. <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> was taken off the operating table, hauled back out, then made another entrance. Camera flashes continued as a red laser beam shot into <PERSON> Sid </PERSON>'s mouth `` I think the camera flashes are bothering his eyes,'' <PERSON> Weldy </PERSON> said. Cotton was taped over the snake's eyes and the laser therapy continued, ultimately to be declared a success.

 When <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>'s comedy routine on the `` seven dirty words'' was broadcast by a radio station in 1978, it prompted a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on indecency. A decade later, a character on the hit network sitcom `` Designing Women'' used a derivative of one of those words in describing another character who was obsessed with enlarging her bosom. No, it is n't just imagination. Network standards are loosening up. `` The networks are being more lenient, and I think the reason is a five-letter word _ C-A-B-L-E,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON>, executive producer of `` Designing Women.'' Sexually explicit language and situations on network television have produced occasional complaints, but audiences are apparently rather blase after being presented a variety of R-rated cable fare, not to mention videocassettes. <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 62.2 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes with televisions also have a VCR. The networks, faced with remote-control `` grazing,'' cable options and videocassettes, are having to loosen up or lose viewers. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 1 network, broadcast `` Favorite Son,'' a political potboiler spiced up with scenes of sexual bondage. In an episode of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` thirtysomething,'' a wife crawled around on the floor in search of a fumbled diaphragm. Last season, `` Saturday Night Live'' executive producer <PERSON> Lorne </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> complained about his battle with network censors over a sketch whose purpose was to see how often actors could say the word for the male sex organ on network TV. This season, the sketch got on the air. `` The average family in a major urban center can have access to 30-plus different television signals, not to mention home video, -LRB- where -RRB- they can see explicit language, full nudity and simulated sex in far more graphic and strong ways than you've ever seen on network television,'' says <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> vice president for program marketing and administration. He says networks are loosening standards, but carefully keeping back from the `` cutting edge'' of change. `` We're not changing first,'' <PERSON> Gerson </PERSON> said. Do viewers mind? `` I get a lot of discussion on it, but really when you sit down and look at it and hear what's said, I do n't really hear anybody complaining,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fact is,'' he said, `` whether you like it or not, it does produce ratings, which means that people are watching it.'' `` There are three groups of viewers out there,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, head of Virginia-based Viewers for Quality Television. `` There's your group that would really like to see more -LRB- explicit material -RRB-. They enjoy that. It's interesting, and it's entertaining, and it's fun. ... `` Then there's another group that are your prudes who really feel that there should n't be a single dirty word, no open-mouthed kissing, no bedroom scenes. Those people are going to always object, and they must be just screaming right about now. `` And then there's the group that just accepts it and keeps their eye on it and turns the dial if they do n't like it.'' When the radio station broadcast <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>'s `` seven dirty words'' routine _ <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> was explaining that there are seven words not allowed to be broadcast _ a complaint to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> prompted a lawsuit that led to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. The FCC does not get involved in network standards, but investigates complaints against the stations that it licenses. A complaint about a network show would have to meet the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s definition of indecency before action would be taken Indecency is described as `` patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium.'' For network censors, `` community standards'' apply to a global village, where a `` community'' can be a time period or a demographic group. The changing expectations of television audiences have changed the stereotypical scissor-wielding censor into something of ad hoc sociologist. `` TV is a dynamic medium. It has to stay in touch with society. It has to grow as society grows and deal with subjects that are relevant to people's lives,'' said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Margo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> vice president for program practices. `` I think the objective here is not to go too far. It's to be willing to grow, to be willing to take prudent risks, but never to do anything that's going to offend a significant portion of our viewing audience or advertisers or affiliates.'' All three networks have cut back their standards and practices departments to save money, but insist nothing has gotten on the air that would not have before. The cutbacks have, however, `` increased the possibility of risk,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> vice president for broadcast standards and practices, `` because you do n't have an overview and backup system that existed.'' CBS and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> have eliminated one level of censors and put a bigger workload on supervisors. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> eliminated its standards and practices department completely, re-assigning most of its functions to the entertainment division, which may be akin to the fox guarding the henhouse. But <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was no doubt chastened by its experience with <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s two-hour special `` Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's Underground. Though the sensationalistic special ranked No. 5 in the Nielsen ratings for the week, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said it lost money because so many advertisers pulled out. <PERSON> Gerson </PERSON> says the show was actually `` a triumph'' for the remnants of the standards department, in view of how much gruesome material was eliminated. During a recent presentation to television critics meeting in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> was accosted by an actor dressed as a priest and forced to swear on a stack of Bibles that he would not air another <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> special. `` Devil Worship'' was attacked by television critics in part because of its early time period, 8 p.m. EST, when presumably children could be watching. In fact, much of the shift in standards has taken place after 9 p.m. when networks assume mostly adults are watching. An episode of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s 10 o'clock program `` L.A. Law'' opened in the setting of a fertility clinic where a patient providing a sperm sample moaned loudly from behind a bathroom door. It turned out he was having trouble getting the lid off the specimen jar. In an episode of the 9 p.m. `` Cheers'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> the bartender was stranded behind a table because of his state of sexual excitement. `` The standards really relate to the kind of program you're dealing in,'' said <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> `` What may work in a 10 o'clock program, like ` thirtysomething,' ... would be totally inappropriate to an 8 o'clock program.'' One way standards departments have cut their workload is by paying less attention to such G-rated shows as `` Murder, She Wrote.'' But even `` Designing Women,'' which often tackles sexual subjects, has found the going easier of late, said <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON>, whose wife, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON> writes most of the scripts. <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON> said the show has had a good relationship with the censors, but he nevertheless was surprised that the questionable breast word was approved. The censor, after seeing the script, wanted to `` reserve judgment.'' `` A lot of times, if we disagree with them, we'll say, ` Look, why do n't you let us shoot it and we'll shoot an alternative, and see how it's used and how it looks in the context of the show,''' <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON> said. `` Fortunately, I do n't remember a time when we've done that they did n't come back later and say, ` OK, we see what you were going for, and it's OK.'

<HEAD>Los Angeles County Gang Killings Set Record</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than one person died in a gang-related killing for every day of 1988 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said authorities who blamed the record number of deaths on turf and drug battles fought by well-armed street hoods. Altogether, there were 452 gang-related slayings in the county, according to statistics compiled by all area law enforcement agencies and released by the sheriff's department on Friday. `` It's staggering,'' sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> said. `` We're in a crisis. They're still killing as fast as ever. I do n't see any indication it'll go down.'' `` There's more than one a day,'' said V.G. Guinses, a gang counselor. `` That does n't include kids on life support, or people handicapped or paralyzed'' by bullet wounds. The slayings surpassed the previous record of 387 gang-related murders reported the year before, <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> said. Earlier in the week, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police department reported that gang slayings in its jurisdiction reached a record 257 in 1988 compared with 205 the year before. Some authorities blamed the increased carnage on the more sophisticated weapons that gang members are purchasing with profits from illegal drug sales. More semiautomatic, military-style assault weapons are being confiscated from gang members, authorities say. `` I think the major factor is the weapons,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police Deputy Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathburn </PERSON>. `` These are dangerous weapons. They're good for one thing _ killing people. There are a lot of them out there. An enormous number.''

 Six former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines landed in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Saturday in peace, 24 years after the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> combat troops hit the beaches of <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nang </PERSON> in war. `` Man, it brought so many memories, looking out at them rice paddies,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Noe </PERSON>, a 40-year-old firefighter from <LOCATION> Stoughton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` Just seeing the children ... to me when I was real young here _ 18, 19 years old _ I always felt for the children and I think that's what brought me back here, too I had a real warm feeling for all those people. It's an honest-to-God feeling.'' Gazing at the mountains in the distance, <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Genna </PERSON>, a 41-year-old maintenance man from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, thought of his days as a 19-year-old Marine under fire from North Vietnamese gunners hidden in similar mountains in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` They look awfully familiar,'' he said. `` They're not the same ones, but they look the same.'' The former Marines are self-styled unofficial ambassadors of good will, hoping their 10-day visit will bring other veterans back and better relations between the two countries. `` As long as we can get veterans back over here to see what's going on here and to let the world know that these are fantastic, wonderful people, and they need help _ if we can get that across to the American people I'd be happy,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, a 41-year-old farmer from <LOCATION> Langdon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> The other former Marines include <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>, 39, a <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, police lieutenant; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, a maker of electric signs; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, a 54-year-old free-lance writer from <LOCATION> Davidsonville </LOCATION>, Md. Their patrol into the past, a journey to heal their own pain as much as to look their former foes in the eyes, will take them to what is no more _ the demilitarized zone along the 17th parallel that once divided <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> into North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The 11th Marine Battalion, 3rd Marine Division, in which all of the men except <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> served, planted about 100,000 land mines to protect a string of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> outposts along the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON> Cam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Thien </PERSON> <PERSON> Gio </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> and Dong Ha. After North <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> defeated the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> in 1975, it reunified the country. Vietnamese officials say thousands of civilians were killed clearing the land mines for farming and housing in postwar <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, but they say all the mines are gone. The Marines are not so sure. Concerned that the mines are still causing civilian casualties, they want to attempt to verify the Vietnamese claims. `` It's a sense of accomplishment, given a chance to come back to a country where we fought,'' said <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>. `` We're looking forward to meeting the Vietnamese soldiers.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he was unsure of himself when he arrived at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s international airport `` As I remember <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, you had to be looking over your shoulder, and that's history now but still you're very unsure when you're going through customs Everybody's in uniform.'' His anxiety soon vanished, wiped away by the charm and friendliness of the Vietnamese children. `` I'm glad I came,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` None of us can describe what the emotion we feel is,'' said <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>. `` It's different now,'' said <PERSON> Noe </PERSON>. `` Nothing wrong is happening.''

 Machine guns jut from the walls of Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s compound, the army is building roadblocks, and anti-aircraft batteries point north toward the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> in case the Americans come again. Officials and ordinary Libyans in the streets express fear of attack. The bomb-shattered former <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in the heart of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> is a daily reminder of American ability to strike. Some diplomats say the mood reminds them of the days before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air raids on <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> in April 1986, intended as punishment for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s alleged support of international terrorism. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> speaks defiantly about the possibility of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack, but the diplomats believe he has genuine fear of one. They said <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> believes the decision has been made to attack a plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, 60 miles outside <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, and other targets. The Americans say the plant is to manufacture chemical weapons. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says it will make pharmaceuticals. A Western diplomat said his first impression had been that Libyan officials were `` not really worried, that their talk about the American menace was for domestic consumption. Later, after talking with them day after day, I became convinced they are really scared.'' He and the others spoke on condition their names not be revealed. In downtown <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, heavy machine guns manned by soldiers in olive fatigues rested on the white walls, 25 feet high, around the leader's fortified compound. Diplomats said the number of guns had been increased. Camouflaged tanks and anti-aircraft batteries were positioned in a line of trees behind a high brown wall a few blocks from the compound. Reporters taken by bus to the desert southwest of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant, saw surface-to-air missiles aimed northward, toward the sea. Radar scanned from a barren ridge and troops manned roadblocks on the highways. One diplomat said the army might be keeping tabs on dissident Moslem fundamentalists returning from <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, but another said roadblocks were common in tense times and these could be linked to the fear of attack. `` They seem to be afraid the Americans could pop up in a jeep somewhere along the highway,'' said an envoy from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know why they think a roadblock could catch a convoy of American troops.'' European and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> diplomats say <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has asked their governments repeatedly in the past few weeks to use their influence with the Americans. Some feel the momentum of accusation and tension between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> will be difficult to stop. A European said, for example, that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had `` maneuvered itself into a difficult position by talking so loudly.'' Several Europeans expressed the belief President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was obsessed with <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. `` Every American president has his own favorite top enemy,'' one said. `` For <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> it is <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, although I ca n't imagine anybody really takes <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> seriously as a No. 1 enemy.'' They agreed the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader could be counted on to play into <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s hands with bluster and threats of terrorist reprisal. As one put it: `` <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> is the worst spokesman for his country.'' Despite all this, the Europeans said they felt <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was serious in requesting direct negotiations with the incoming administration of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. They also said more moderate members of his government were encouraging such proposals. `` People in the government ... believed that the policy of confrontation in the mind of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> would lead to disaster,'' one said. In the past year, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has tried to improve relations with <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and its North African neighbors, according to the diplomats. Most shops and cafes in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> were closed a year ago. Now they are open, although poorly supplied. A few blue-and-white sack dresses from <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> hung in a clothing store. The next window held a sparse display of faucets and other plumbing supplies. Cans of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> rested on nearly empty cafe shelves. Libyans now can talk and travel more freely, but diplomats and others said the slight liberalization has created problems for <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. They said a growing, more organized opposition worries him and there are signs of greater activism among Moslem fundamentalists. The Moslem Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group the government says tried to overthrow <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> in 1984, has held demonstrations at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fateh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. Anti-Gadhafi slogans appeared on campus walls recently but were painted over quickly, said a source associated with professors at <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fateh </PERSON>. European diplomats say <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> remains the only powerful man in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and will allow only so much openness and dissent before cracking down. `` The reforms can only go so far, only what he can control,'' one said. `` Then he will put a stop to it.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> agreed today to hold new talks to reduce conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, diplomats said. The agreement came after <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> settled a territorial dispute. Negotiators from the world's two most powerful military alliances initialed the agreement calling for the new arms talks, said a Western diplomat who attended the closed-door session. He spoke on condition of anonymity. Diplomats also prepared to sign a landmark human rights accord later today that was informally accepted Friday by the East and West blocs and 12 neutral nations. Resolution of the Greece-Turkey dispute paved the way for the signing. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will join 33 other foreign ministers at a three-day meeting, starting Tuesday, to wind up the 35-nation <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> review conference. One Western diplomat said the Greek-Turkish dispute was resolved after last-minute telephone calls between <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and the Turkish capital, <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>. Another Western envoy, also speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated the dispute was settled after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and three unidentified <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries submitted letters to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Their content was not disclosed. The arms talks, dubbed the Negotations on Conventional Armed Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, could start as early as March, diplomats say. The call for the talks will be included in a 35-nation agreement designed to ensure freedom of religion and travel by citizens of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nations and to boost East-West contacts at all levels. The Greek-Turkish dispute over a strategic corner of Turkish territory close to the border with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had threatened to unravel both the call for new East-West arms talks and the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> conference accord. The Balkan nations deadlocked over the possible inclusion of a strategic region of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Mersin </LOCATION>, in the new arms talks on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> insisted that the port be included in those talks. <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> had insisted that <LOCATION> Mersin </LOCATION> is a key port for shipping supplies to northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, which is controlled by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. It was not immediately clear how the two nations had reached a compromise on their dispute, but the compromise reportedly put off the question of whether <LOCATION> Mersin </LOCATION> would be included in the new talks. Western diplomats have praised the human rights accord, which contains landmark provisions on human rights, including enhanced religious freedoms, clearer regulations on travel and emigration from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, more freedom of information and an end to the abuse of psychiatry. Western diplomats also hailed as a triumph the achievement for the first time of a mechanism allowing <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> signatory states to raise human rights affairs with one another. The 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act was signed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and all European nations except <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. Many of its human rights provisions have been violated in the past by the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. Western diplomats noted the new <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> accords had been made possible by the recent reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but stressed the test would come in whether the East's Communist nations adhere to it Human rights are to be discussed at annual follow-up conferences, in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> this summer, in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> next year and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1991. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference was disputed into the last weeks of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> review forum. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> eventually agreed to go, but only if Soviet reforms continue and are institutionalized.

<HEAD>The Marks Of Smoot May Soon Be Moot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Smoot marks are vanishing from the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, and the 30-year legacy of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and his fraternity brothers may soon be just another <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> legend. `` There's no item in our contract concerning the replacement of Smoots,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McInnis </PERSON>, superintendent for <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the general contractor on the bridge repair job. Late one night in October 1958, members of <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> used <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON> to blaze a new trail in distance measurement and fraternity prankdom. <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>'s 5-feet-7 frame was manhandled, length by length, to measure the distance of the span crossing the <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which is also known as the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION>. The idea was to let strollers know how far they had to go. The fraternity brothers painted Smootmarks on the bridge walkway: `` 10 Smoots,'' `` 20 Smoots,'' and so on, reporting that the distance they measured was `` 364.4 Smoots, plus one ear.'' Successive fraternity members have repainted the <ORGANIZATION> Smoots </ORGANIZATION> twice a year. But the work to replace the cracked and corroded bridge has already destroyed the <ORGANIZATION> Smoots </ORGANIZATION> on the bridge's west sidewalk. If the repair timetable goes as expected, the east <ORGANIZATION> Smoots </ORGANIZATION> will be gone by fall. The construction crew says the remaining Smoots could be saved if someone foots the bill. Labor Steward <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Troville </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Smoots </ORGANIZATION> could be cut out of the old concrete and implanted in the new. But he did n't think much of that idea, saying the 60 or so coats of paint make the Smoot lines very slippery. `` I've seen many bicyclists brought down by the Smoots,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>, now 48, an executive vice president of a Washington-based computer and business equipment association, said he is optimistic about the ultimate fate of the Smoot. He said there may be a future for a microSmoot or a kiloSmoot. `` I understand that the yard got its start as the length of the king's arm and the inch was the width of a knuckle,'' he said. But there is a move among students to `` reSmoot'' the rebuilt bridge using the original's son, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>, 21, an MIT junior. He has not yet committed himself to the project. The junior <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON> also cautioned that his height, 5-feet-11, would result in a different calibration. But reSmooting the bridge would correct an error. The original group overlooked a bridge section that spans Storrow Drive on the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> side of the river. `` So they were off by approximately 26.87 Smoots, give or take an ear,'' <PERSON> McInnis </PERSON> said.

 The flag-draped casket of an American pilot killed in the 1986 bombing raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was put aboard a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> transport plane that left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today, a day after <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> released the body. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillen </PERSON> said the body was identified Friday night as that of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribas-Dominicci </PERSON> who died during the raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in the early hours of April 15, 1986. <PERSON> Dillen </PERSON> said the plane was headed for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base at <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION>. The hometown of the pilot, who was 33 at his death, is <LOCATION> Utuado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. During a brief ceremony at the military airport, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON> and Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Creagan </PERSON> placed hand over heart as six Marines carried the casket past them to a C-141 aircraft. <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON> is ambassador to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Creagan </PERSON> is assigned to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dillen </PERSON> said he did not know why the Libyans said the body they flew to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Friday was that of Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the other airman aboard the F-111. <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>, the Italian news agency, today quoted an Italian forensic expert who helped identify the body as saying, `` The identification was made possible on the basis of the comparision of teeth'' with documents provided by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. Three Italian and three American medical experts conducted the examination, said <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>. The bomber was the only plane lost in the raids on <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s capital, and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>, another coastal city. Libyan authorities, in what they called part of `` humanitarian initiatives,'' presented the body to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> on Friday in the rubble of the former headquarters of <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, a target in the raid, according to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> site never was rebuilt. <PERSON> Ribas-Dominicci </PERSON>'s body was flown by military aircraft to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where Italian authorities took possession of the gold-trimmed, white coffin in a simple ceremony at <LOCATION> Ciampino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. A Libyan soldier in green fatigues gently laid a wreath of red flowers atop the casket before <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> air force officers carried it to a mortuary van. The gesture came during a period of international debate over a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> plant that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says can produce chemical weapons, and nine days after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighters shot down two Libyan jets over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the Libyan fighters acted in a threatening manner. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> claimed the planes were unarmed and were downed in a premeditated attack. <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter planes buzzed a <ORGANIZATION> Libyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane flying to <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The Pentagon said it had no information about the incident. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> welcomed the return of the remains and said the action was part of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s humanitarian obligations <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was quoted as saying in a Dec. 24 dispatch that he was returning the body `` especially since this occasion coincides with the end of the rule of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the 1986 attack in retaliation for what he called <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s support for terrorists.

 <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> returns to private life next week after 3 -LCB- tumultuous years as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s top aide for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and much of the city's foreign policy establishment is abuzz over the question of who will succeed him. Outside the cabinet itself, few presidential appointments have generated more interest and curiosity about who President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will select for what is widely regarded as one of the toughest jobs in government. The job carries an imposing title, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs; a spacious paneled office on the sixth floor of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and enough headaches to keep a medium-sized pharmaceutical company in business. The task involves dealing with issues ranging from drugs to debt in 33 hemispheric countries. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team is said by several sources to have reduced the list of candidates to replace <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> to five, four of whom are foreign service officers. The only non-diplomat is <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Helander </PERSON>, 67, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer who has had a long-time association with <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> family business interests in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Helander </PERSON>'s prospects seemed to fade when he left an unfavorable impression on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> staffers during get-acquainted sessions earlier this month. The other candidates said to be on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s short list for <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' job are: _ <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>, ambassador to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and a former ambassador to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> One of his strengths is knowledge of economic issues facing the hemisphere. _ <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> who dealt with Central American issues at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> during the early <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years He also was ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> who serves as deputy to National Security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> Some conservatives oppose his appointment, contending his support for the Nicaraguan Contras is only lukewarm. _ <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> who was the top adviser on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' predecessor, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> has been actively pursuing the assistant secretary post and has told friends he will leave the foreign service if the job goes to someone else. He also has detractors in the conservative camp. Much of the interest in the identity of <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' successor stems from the uncertainty about the course <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will follow on the two dominant hemispheric issues: <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s $ 420 billion foreign debt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to pursue a policy of continuity in most areas of the world but he is considered by most experts as likely to try new directions on Latin policy. The air of uncertainty has been fueled by the almost total absence of discussion about <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, particularly <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, since well before the fall presidential election campaign. Once an issue of highest priority for the administration, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made no mention of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in his summation this past week of his eight years in office. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, in a speech Thursday about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> legacy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, gave only a passing reference to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and did not mention the Contras at all. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will take office with the bulk of the Contra force stationed at camps inside the Honduran border, surviving on U.S.-donated food and other humanitarian supplies. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid last February and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has left unclear what plans he has for the Contras. Some transition team members have indicated privately that the new administration may open talks with the Sandinista government, a clear break with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policy of giving <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> the diplomatic cold shoulder. One possible option for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be to abandon the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> goal of seeking a democratic outcome in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and instead seek an accommodation with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in return for promises of a reduced Soviet-bloc role there. On the debt question, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has left the impression he will seek new approaches that will have the effect of easing Latin repayment obligations.

 Twenty-eight Burmese students returned home Saturday under a controversial program in which <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> repatriates people who fled last year's bloody military crackdown in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. The flight brought to 320 the number of students and other Burmese who have returned under the program, which was established last month by the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> and Burmese military. Only one Burmese remained at the repatriation center at <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s northern city of Tak, a 20-year-old student hospitalized with malaria, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials said. The Burmese had fled to Thai border areas controlled by anti-government guerrillas, seeking refuge after the September military coup in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and the ruthless suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations. Under the Thai-Burmese program, they are brought to the Tak center, then flown to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> aboard Burmese military planes. Interviewed upon arrival in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, chemistry student <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> said many students from the border areas were expected to reach the Tak camp in a few days. Asked about allegations they were being forced back to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, another student, <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Nay </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, said: `` We were looked after very well by the <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, like their children.

 An airline apologized to a double amputee passenger after employees put him on a baggage dolly `` like a sack of potatoes,'' verbally abused him in front of other passengers and treated him so roughly that at one point they pulled off his pants. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hankin </PERSON>, 66, had a first-class ticket aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight on Jan. 9 from his former home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Hankin </PERSON> was so mistreated by airline personnel that his nostalgic trip home became a memory of bitter humiliation, said his daughter, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION>. `` It's hard to believe that people could be so insensitive and we will take whatever measures are needed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, who acknowledged that <PERSON> Hankin </PERSON> was mistreated by employees. <PERSON> Hankin </PERSON> had both his legs amputated at the groin because of a circulation problem he developed in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. He has no tailbone and no hips so balancing in a chair without help is difficult for him, his daughter said. But despite special arrangements made prior to the trip, <PERSON> Hankin </PERSON> ran into trouble, <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> said. After transferring to an alternate flight because of a six-hour delay, <PERSON> Hankin </PERSON> was placed on a baggage cart `` like a sack of potatoes'' and wheeled onto the plane where he waited 45 minutes as other passengers stared at him, <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> protested the lack of first-class seating, she said she was told by the gate agent: `` If he's that sick, he should n't be on a plane; he should be in a hospital.'' After a passenger offered <PERSON> Hankin </PERSON> his seat near the more roomy bulkhead, an airline employee transferred him in such a way that his pants fell off, <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> said. And when <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> explained that she needed a seat next to her father to help him use a hand-held urinal, she said the agent ordered the rest of the crew: `` If she opens her mouth again I want her kicked off the plane.'' <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> would offer <PERSON> Hankin </PERSON> compensation, but he did not elaborate.

 Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters today rescued 32 people from a Cypriot freighter battered by gale-force winds and heavy waves in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. `` Everyone is off,'' a duty officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION> reported, about an hour and 15 minutes after the two MH53-J helicopters had reached the 42,000-ton Yarrowanga. There was no report of any injuries to the crew members, who were lifted by winches into the helicopters, the officer said. The listing ship, which was bound from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> to the St. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaway </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to take on iron ore, suffered one large gash below the waterline on the right side of the hull and a larger hole higher up on the left side. The ship's boiler had failed for a time on Friday, but it was restarted and the ship had been moving under its own power. Fifteen people were taken aboard one helicopter and the other 17 were on the second rescue craft, which were returning to <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Those aboard included the German master, his wife and 30 Filipino seamen. An earlier report said only 31 people had been aboard. The rescue, about 200 miles west of the Irish coast, was completed quickly despite winds in excess of 40 mph and 30-foot seas. The helicopters, based at Woodridge-Bentwaters 70 miles east of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, were refueled en route by two long-range HC-130 Hercules tanker aircraft, which are specially designed for long-range rescue work. A spokesman for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Minister of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had no helicopters capable of in-flight refueling. The rescue center said a Dutch tug, the Typhoon, was expected to reach the <LOCATION> Yarrowanga </LOCATION> on Sunday and attempt to salvage it. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> said the ship had lost 120 square yards of plating below the waterline on the right side and about 200 meters of plating above the water on the left. Two British <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Nimrod reconnaissance planes from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mawgan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION>, southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, reached the bulk carrier before dark on Friday and took pictures, showing a gaping hole in its left side and three hatches open. Relays of Nimrods, designed for long searching at sea, circled the ship overnight.

 A month after his kidnappers said they would kill him, the fate of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who turns 44 on Sunday, remains a mystery. The last word on the American, kidnapped in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> 11 months ago, came Dec. 12 when his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors said they had sentenced him to death for spying for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> No body has been found. The Organization for the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, which claimed responsibility for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction, has also claimed responsibility for kidnapping 12 Lebanese Jews since 1984 and has said it killed eight of them. Four bodies have been found. However, a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> source, familiar with the thinking of pro-Iranian factions, said he did not believe <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> has been slain. `` He's too valuable a card to be wasted,'' said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` He's an American officer who had held sensitive posts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He also served with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. This makes him an American national security interest and an international interest,'' the source said. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is one of 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hostage held longest is <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, led a 76-man <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observer group monitoring the <LOCATION> Lebanon-Israel </LOCATION> border when he was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988. Two days later, the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> issued a statement claiming the abduction and charging that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> spied for the `` satanic <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, to which <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' observer group was attached, denied he was a spy. The kidnappers originally said they would release <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew from territory it occupies in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>; if all Lebanese and Palestinians held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its militia allies were freed; and if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> halted alleged involvement in efforts to crush a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in Israeli-occupied territories. Five days after the kidnapping, the group released a 70-second videotape of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in which he repeated his captors' demands. On Feb. 25, about 10,000 people demonstrated in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> chanting `` death to <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. The pro-Iranian group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be the parent organization for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions holding most of hostages, declared its support for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' kidnapping April 11. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Amin </PERSON>, told a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> news conference that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was `` not kidnapped, but detained.'' `` We have n't been involved in his detention, but we support it,'' he said. In a statement April 21, the kidnappers dropped their offer to free <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and said he would be stand trial `` for the crimes he has committed.'' It accused him of taking part in `` American conspiracies'' against Moslems and supervising `` a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> team to combat Lebanese and Palestinian Islamic organizations.'' The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said in a statement issued in December, `` We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this American spy.''

 More than 200 protesters were arrested today as an anti-abortion group continued to defy a federal judge's order to stop blocking entrances to clinics. About 100 people from Operation Rescue were arrested this morning in front of Planned Parenthood's <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> <PERSON> Center </PERSON>, said a police spokeswoman, Sgt. <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohrmann </PERSON>. They were among about 600 demonstrators at the site. The remainder were arrested at other locations throughout <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, police said. An Operation Rescue spokesman, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuvala </PERSON>, said people were linked together by chain in three locations. The people chained themselves together to `` slow things down'' as long `` as we possibly can to save as many babies as we can,'' <PERSON> Chuvala </PERSON> said. On Friday, about 1,000 members of the anti-abortion group defied a federal judge's order and twice blocked the entrance to the <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> <PERSON> Center </PERSON>. Police arrived and those Operation Rescue protesters not arrested Friday morning left, only to return en masse several hours later and lay down in front of the clinic. One hundred seventy-six people were arrested, and all were charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. They refused to give their names and were held for arraignment, said Officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> issued a permanent injunction against the Binghamton-based group on Tuesday, forbidding members to obstruct access to abortion clinics in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today the story it ran about six men rescued from a collapsed building 35 days after the Armenian earthquake may have been a hoax. On Thursday, the official news agency quoted <PERSON> Aikaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>, 50, as saying he and five other men were rescued Wednesday after surviving on canned goods in a building that collapsed in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> during the Dec. 7 earthquake. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported it could not confirm <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>'s story, and today the news agency said <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>'s sister indicated the story was made up to get <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> into a good hospital in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> was sticking to his story, that doctors could not rule it out, and that reporters were still checking details of the case. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> had threatened to jump out the window of his hospital room if journalists continued to question him about his story and that doctors were taking the threat seriously. Reporters of the Armenian news agency <ORGANIZATION> Armenpress </ORGANIZATION> found <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Julietta </PERSON>, who allegedly had met him as he was rescued Wednesday but then disappeared, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said `` At first the sister denied being related to <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> but then admitted that she took <PERSON> Aikaz </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> hospital and that he indeed is her brother. It follows from her words that <PERSON> Aikaz </PERSON> turned to her on Jan. 6 with a request to take him to a good <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> hospital,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Along the road to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> the legend of being saved after 35 days was supposedly thought up,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. None of the other five people who allegedly were trapped in the basement of a nine-story apartment building with <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> have been found. Officials gave up hope weeks ago of finding more survivors in the Dec. 7 quake, which killed 25,000 people. They began bulldozing the ruins in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and other cities to prevent decaying bodies from spreading disease. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today that Professor <PERSON> Gurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Badanyan </PERSON>, a leading Soviet internal medicine specialist, believed <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> had been suffering from chronic lung and heart deficiencies for at least several years. <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> was initially reported to be suffering from pneumonia. A psychiatric exam indicated that <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> is not mentally ill, but doctors observed that he mixed up some facts including the names of children and the number of people who were trapped with him. `` Doctors think this is possible as a result of strong psychological stress. We decided to ask him a direct question: is he really telling the truth. <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> said, ` Yes,' and in a rather mixed-up way repeated his first version,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> correspondents <PERSON> Kirill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dibrova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchglenko </PERSON> wrote. They said doctors `` do not reject the theoretical possibility'' that <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> had spent a month trapped in the basement. It added that `` today <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> told doctors that if journalists do not leave him in peace, he will throw himself out the window.'' It said doctors `` consider this threat fully possible.''

<HEAD>Bush Inaugural: A Better View, $25 Million Housewarming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a man who has uprooted wife and children 28 times in his career, moves this week into yet another house, one with a better view. And a $ 25 million party will welcome him to the neighborhood. It is the most glorified ritual of the Republic, this quadrennial festival, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is celebrating, as usual, as if Friday's inauguration were for the first president, and not the 41st Well, maybe not the first. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, after all, took the oath in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and did so without pageantry. The founding fathers wanted to avoid any semblance of <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> monarchy, and kept the ceremony as spartan as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s, 200 years later, will be elaborate. Even <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who intends to wear a regular business suit for his oath-taking on the Capitol's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portico </LOCATION> on Friday, confessed he is `` not entirely'' comfortable with the costly, four-day panoply of social events surrounding that simple act. But he added `` I have no apologies for the way we're doing it,'' because the country deserves a celebration every four years. The show officially begins Wednesday, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> leading the public in an outdoor cavalcade at the Lincoln Memorial. The audience will be given flashlights to beam a `` thousand points of light,'' the phrase <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> often uses to symbolize <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s private volunteers. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fly-by, an Army parachute demonstration, music by the <PERSON> Gatlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> and the Beach Boys, and a fireworks finale also are on the program. The opening spectacle is one of at least nine free events sponsored by the inaugural committee, an unprecedented number, even as other, invitation-only affairs boast hefty prices. Three black-tie dinners Wednesday night, for example, cost $ 1,500 per person. A box for eight at the entertainment gala at the capital's Convention Center Thursday goes for $ 25,000 You can see the two-hour show, featuring <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON>, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, live and for free on CBS. Overall, the estimated cost of more than a score of major, official events, including 11 inaugural balls Friday night, is a record $ 25 million, with most of that raised privately via ticket prices and the sale of commemorative items ranging to $ 1,200 for a bald eagle in <LOCATION> Steuben </LOCATION> glass. By contrast, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s two inaugurals cost $ 20 million in 1985 and $ 15.5 million in 1981; <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s cost $ 3.5 million in 1977. The public pays a share. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated $ 750,000 to cover part of the cost of the Friday ceremony on the Capitol grounds, and also to foot its own luncheon with the new president. And $ 2.5 million in tax money is earmarked for the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inaugural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is organizing various military contributions, including marching bands, chauffeurs for dignitaries, and security and traffic control. About 8,500 members of the armed forces will be involved. Given tolerable weather, an estimated 150,000 people are expected to flock to the Capitol in winter's chill for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oath-taking and inaugural address Friday. Tickets, dispensed free of charge by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, will be required for all but the most-distant spots. Planners have their fingers crossed; <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second swearing-in, in 1985, had to be moved inside and his parade was canceled when temperatures plummeted below 10 degrees. Already, with smaller events still being added on a daily basis, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration schedule is nearly as long as the list of arrivals at National Airport. More than 70 events, ranging from state receptions to a prayer service at National Cathedral on Sunday, have been coordinated with the inaugural committee, and scores of other, independent shindigs are planned, including the usual array of counter-inaugural parties for critics of the new president. There are big parties, little parties. Parties expensive, parties moderate. Parties hard-to-get-in, parties impossible-to-get-in. The hottest ticket is one of cheapest, $ 50, for the `` Black Tie and Boots Ball'' hosted by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. It sold out all 5,500 spots within 24 hours and has returned thousands of checks with regrets. The bash, incidentally, will feature <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s favorite Tex-Mex food, two-step tunes by <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Nix </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cowboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>, and offers a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> pickup with a gun rack as the door prize The 11 official balls a night earlier are expected to draw 60,000 invited guests, including 12,000 youngsters at two casual-dress youth balls, jostling for a brief glimpse of the new president. The nine adult versions cost $ 175 per ticket. For their $ 1,500, guests at the candlelight dinners Wednesday night will be served <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> crab pate loaf made with clotted cream, roast baby veal `` forced with oysters and sage,'' asparagus spears, corn souffle and a salad made of Belgian Endive, spinach and watercress. Desert will be an apple and cranberry brown betty with cinnamon ice cream covered with bourbon custard sauce, followed by a demitasse of coffee. All over town, chefs are adding an early Federal touch to their menus _ the brown betty, for example _ in keeping with one of the inaugural's themes, `` From <PERSON> George </PERSON> to <PERSON> George </PERSON>.'' Even more were offering chili, gumbo, tacos and pork rinds, in keeping with the tastes of a <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> turned Texan. The week's activities include a Salute to The First Lady, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at each of three halls in the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, where a $ 50 ticket buys a choice of <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> or <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> for entertainment. Several events are aimed at teen-agers and children, including a forum with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> on Thursday and a history-and-entertainment pageant at Constitution Hall on Saturday. Friday is the biggest day, of course, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural speech will be followed with the traditional parade west on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> to the White House. The 10,000 marchers will include 34 military units, high school and college bands from every state, tootling calliopes, clopping Clydesdales, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Raisins and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The `` Yellow Rose of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' the `` Eyes of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' and `` Deep In The Heart Of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'' may be heard a time or two. After dancing the night away, the President and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will open the doors of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to the public on Saturday from 8-11 a.m., personally greeting thousands of people likely to wait in line for hours. Guests will be allowed to stroll the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION>, too.

 Blue is back. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is down. And the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> look, come Jan. 20, will be passe. The inauguration of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brings much more than a change in government. It's the launch of a whole new look _ a look that is prompting sighs of relief among graying women larger than size 4 and men's clothing retailers who never met a brown suit they liked. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is keeping her inaugural outfits a secret, at least until the last minute. But a few things are certain. Her favorite color is blue _ so farewell to scarlet, the color so identified with <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that reporters wore it to press conferences in an effort to attract her husband's attention. Farewell, too, to designer <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON>, another favorite of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, an unabashed size 12, prefers <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Blass </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Scassi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adele </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. She's having several designers put together her inaugural wardrobe. `` There's no doubt in my mind that she'll look spectacular from head to toe, but it will be a different style -LRB- from <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB-,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>. `` She'll have her own style.'' When he takes his oath of office on the Capitol steps, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be wearing a business suit _ possibly a dark <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> gray number he purchased within the last two weeks from <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, a men's store a few blocks from the White House. Size 42 long, alterations on the sleeves and cuffs. Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also bought a couple of suits from <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> last week _ one navy blue, the other a navy stripe. `` If I were to guess, I would say the solid navy for the swearing-in,'' said store manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheftell </PERSON>. `` No browns, no tans. These gentlemen know what colors do the most for them and that's why they're sticking with the blues and grays,'' <PERSON> Sheftell </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s penchant for brown did n't do much for <PERSON> Sheftell </PERSON> `` Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never got away from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> look,'' <PERSON> Sheftell </PERSON> said gingerly. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a traditional dresser, which stems back from his time at <LOCATION> Yale </LOCATION>. We used to call it <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>.'' He smiled, anticipating a resurgence in sales. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wore traditional tails to the swearing-in in 1981, but they shifted to business suits in 1985. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is more comfortable in a business suit,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>. `` Also, all of the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are going to be dressed in suits as well. He did n't want to feel overdressed.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s tony boutiques and department stores are in an inaugural merchandising frenzy, their bunting-draped windows filled with crisp tuxedos, bright full-skirted gowns and sparkling rhinestone evening bags. `` People are buying long dresses, very elaborate, a lot of full skirts, bright colors as well as black. It's been pretty hectic,'' said <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizik </PERSON>, part owner of <PERSON> Rizik </PERSON>'s, a downtown specialty store in the heart of the power shopping district. Any changes from 1985? `` There's more of a range this time,'' she said, referring to purchase prices. Last time, they were mainly very expensive. Gowns were on sale for half-price at the <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> salon across the street from <PERSON> Rizik </PERSON>'s. Black sequins, emerald taffeta, red velvet, white satin. Full skirts, tight bodices, spaghetti straps, no straps. Some of them $ 1,500 _ after reduction. `` The sales are in timing with the balls, which makes it easier on everybody,'' said saleswoman <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. `` They're buying bright colors because it's a happy time _ reds and blues.'' For those who do n't have $ 1,500 to blow on a ball gown, <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> has opened a temporary branch of her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> establishment, One Night Stand, at a suburban Holiday Inn. The room is lined with gowns; she brought 250 to rent for one night only at prices ranging from $ 175 to $ 350. Necklaces go for $ 20, earrings for $ 10. `` People are dressing up much more than they were 10 years ago, but who wants to go out and spend a couple of thousand dollars for a dress?'' <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> asked airily between appointments. `` We probably see about 20 people a day. We can always fit people in as long as we know they are coming.'' One Night Stand may be a godsend for society tyros, but the more traditional couture customers are frequenting their usual haunts _ places like <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION>. A week before the balls, the uptown branch of the fancy department store had sold 100 gowns and was anticipating an additional five or 10 sales to last-minute shoppers. `` We're selling a very full ball type of gown,'' said public relations manager <PERSON> Juana </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON>. `` A lot of people thought it -LRB- the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inauguration -RRB- would be more understated, but we have n't really seen a change.'' <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> has developed a $ 1,200 pair of shoes called `` the stars and stripes shoe,'' a white satin silk pump covered with pave rhinestones in red, white and blue, configured in stars and stripes. <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> said only one pair had been sold, by a branch in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Another inaugural special, also going begging, was a $ 47,000 eagle brooch encrusted with gems. `` This would be perfect for <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON>. `` It really would, because of the eagle, and although it's all precious jewels, it's an understated piece. She likes the understated type of jewelry and it's really elegant.'' Are you listening, Mr. President-elect?

<HEAD>Univeristy to Decide if Heir Can Use 133-year-old Scholarship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Even back when a loaf of bread cost a couple of cents, it must have seemed like a bargain: Contribute $ 100, and your sons, your grandsons, your great-grandsons, and so on in perpetuity would get free tuition at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Sixty-eight people took the school up on its offer back in 1856, and a descendant of one of them is trying to get the school to make good on the deal. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Raper </PERSON> is the first descendant of state Rep. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, one of the purchasers, to try to benefit from his great-great-great-great-grandfather's investment. However, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> residents now pay about $ 1,100 a semester, not $ 8 as in 1856, and the university is studying how it will handle the family's claim. University counsel <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> says he will review the request when he gets copies of wills and documents that establish a line of succession for the scholarship. <PERSON> Raper </PERSON>, a 1988 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Owen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Spencer </LOCATION>, is majoring in business at <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, a state university that was founded in 1820. His mother, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raper </PERSON>, said last week she has the documents <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> says he needs, and threatened to sue the university if the scholarship is not honored. Mrs. <PERSON> Raper </PERSON> said she has known about the scholarship since she was a little girl, but considered the piece of paper as just a curiosity until a year ago. Previous generations of <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>'s descendants either did n't go to school or included no sons. The scholarship specifies male descendants because women were not admitted to the school back when it was created. Mrs. <PERSON> Raper </PERSON> said when her mother died a year ago and her son was making plans to attend <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the significance of the scholarship hit her. She consulted a lawyer, and decided to follow up on it. `` It's something that my great-great-great grandfather purchased in the belief that his heirs would be taken care of,'' she said. `` He was a supporter of the university, and I'm sure $ 100 helped tremendously at that time.'' If the validity of the scholarship has to be decided in court, <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> says, it would be the first time. He said similar requests have come up a few times over the decades. But for at least 40 years they have been rejected for in-state residents on the basis of a university ruling that technically, nobody from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> pays tuition, only `` fees.'' Out-of-state residents are eligible for partial scholarships _ the difference between in-state `` fees'' and whatever the total charged to out-of-state residents is, the ruling stated. Whether that definition will be applied in <PERSON> Raper </PERSON>'s case, in order to disqualify him, is what university officials are trying to decide. But Mrs. <PERSON> Raper </PERSON> said her great-great-great grandfather would not have purchased a perpetual scholarship if it were only intended to pay out-of-state tuition. `` I just ca n't understand why he'd purchase something that would be no good to him,'' she said.

 Thirty-five years after a young <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> stepped up to the pulpit at <ORGANIZATION> Dexter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, aging members of his congregation carry on the activist spirit he fostered. The red-brick building situated a block from the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> looks much as it did the day he arrived. The worn, dark pews are the same ones members sat in to hear <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s sermons. Only cushions have been added. The Rev. <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION>, the current pastor, said physical appearances are not the only things that remain unchanged at the church, now known as the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church and recognized in 1974 as a national historic landmark. King, who would have turned 60 Sunday, came to Dexter Avenue in the fall of 1954 at age 25. On Dec. 2, 1955, blacks went to his church to organize the <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> bus boycott, often regarded as a starting point for the civil rights movement. Branch said that kind of activist spirit _ which dates back to the church's founding in 1877 _ still exists in the congregation. The church is a meeting place for social activists, and its work extends into <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where the congregation supports missionary work. King `` would be pleased to some extent because we have increased substantially in our benevolent work,'' <PERSON> Branch </PERSON> said in an interview last week. He said `` a constant stream'' of people comes to the church in need of help. `` Hardly a week passes that we do not get appeals, and many are white,'' said Branch, who taught at <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> while King was a student. But <PERSON> Zelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who remembers King's first sermons, said he would not be satisfied. `` He would think we were not doing enough,'' she said. On Monday, the national holiday marking King's birthday, a noon service featuring speakers and singing is expected to attract scores of visitors. On Sunday, congregants will remember their former pastor with a quieter service. Branch said <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Avenue </PERSON> <PERSON> Baptist </PERSON> had about 460 members in King's day, but that number has dwindled to about 250 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON>, a member of the church committee looking for a new pastor, had heard about King from a friend while in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. King had planned to go to <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, to preach, but <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> persuaded him to come to <LOCATION> Dexter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` He was young and energetic. In fact, one of the members said, ` Why did Mr. <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> bring us that boy to preach here?' But we found out he was much more than a boy,'' she said. Members knew they had a good preacher in King, `` but we did n't know how special he was,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said King remained at <LOCATION> Dexter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> through 1960, when the demands of the civil rights movement required his full attention. Some of the programs King instituted at Dexter Avenue Baptist still are in place, such as his Month Clubs, in which members sharing birthdates in the same month get together for service projects. Branch disagreed with assessments that King built <LOCATION> Dexter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION>, or vice versa. King's personality dictated his destiny, <PERSON> Branch </PERSON> said, adding, `` He was headed this direction growing up at <LOCATION> Ebenezer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' And Branch said the church exhibited a keen social conscience long before King, as early as the late 1800s, when news accounts indicate it provided assistance for disaster victims in Central America.

He will leave office three days later, to be succeeded by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, assuming <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, and fly home to <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The trip had been on hold until <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> settled a dispute over how much Turkish territory would be included in arms control negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. In 6 -LCB- years, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, 68, has flown more than 1 million miles on diplomatic missions. On this one he will spend about 18 hours in the air and about 32 hours on the ground. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> conference has run for 27 months. Its windup first was delayed until the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was satisfied with the reforms the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had made in human rights. The release of more than 600 political prisoners, reunification of more than 100 divided families and a nine-year high in Jewish emigration met the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> test. As a result, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> recommended and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved the holding of another human rights review in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1991 and the closing down of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> conference. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, both instrumental in the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, will discuss preparations for the arms control talks and probably the scheduled Feb. 15 completion of a Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not directly involved in the dispute between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, but worked behind the scenes for a resolution. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, called on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> late Thursday to discuss the situation.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address Saturday: My fellow Americans, over the years I've greatly enjoyed this opportunity to get together with you and report on the week's events here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But next week, after witnessing the inauguration of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I will head back to the ranch. And we go with full hearts, with best wishes for <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, and with gratitude to all of you. It's been a privilege to serve the people and the nation we've always loved and love so much today. It's difficult, of course, to put all of the events of eight busy tumultuous years in perspective. In fact, that's best left to the impartial judgment of history. But as I look back over these Saturday talks, I ca n't help but think about how often, at moments of accomplishment and triumph as well as crisis and heartbreak, we came together in this way. A president giving his accounting to those under our system of government to whom he is accountable. We shared a great deal together. For me, it's been a special relationship. Believe me, Saturdays will never seem the same. I'll miss you But you know, somehow, messages of farewell, leave-taking, and nostalgia, do n't quite capture my mood today. Do n't get me wrong, we've had great years and done much together. The economy is booming; long-festering social problems like drugs, crime, have declined; and our educational standards are being dealt with; and for the first time in the postwar era, the Soviet menace shows some signs of relenting. This last development is, of course, so heartening to those of us who've lived through all the brooding terrors of the postwar era. We're prayerful and hopeful _ hopeful that the next generation of Americans will not have to contend, as we did, with the nightmares of nuclear terror and totalitarian expansionism. You know, shortly after World War II and the struggle against <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> looked with grave concern and sadness at a world that evolved so quickly, as he put it, `` from triumph and tragedy.'' But then, as he began to detect the vigor and resolve of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> against the Soviet menace, and for freedom in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and everywhere in the world, a vigor and resolve shared equally by an American president and an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of different political parties, he grew hopeful and grateful for this unselfish, bipartisan unity. There's a story I want to tell you today about a meeting <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> had with a group of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalists in 1952, at a time when all the troubles of the Cold War, including the hardship of morally and militarily rearming the West, were keenly felt. His friend and physician, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, recorded <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s appraisal of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leadership. `` What other nation in history,'' <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> asked, `` when it became supremely powerful has had no thought of territorial aggrandizement, no ambition but to use its resources for the good of the world? I marvel at <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s altruism, her sublime disinterestedness.'' `` All at once I realized,'' Lord <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> wrote, `` Winston was in tears. His eyes were red. His voice faltered. He was deeply moved.'' Well, generous words, honest emotion from a great world leader; and now, more than a quarter century later, as the decade of the'80s comes to a close, there is hope that the generosity and resolve that <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> saw in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people is at last paying an historic dividend. The possibility of a new time in human history, when all the problems that so haunted the postwar world give way to peace and expansion and freedom. So, you can see why, to me, the story of these last eight years and this presidency goes far beyond any personal concerns. It is a continuation, really, of a far larger story, a story of a people and a cause. A cause that, from our earliest beginnings, has defined us as a nation and given purpose to our national existence. The hope of human freedom, the quest for it, the achievement of it, is the American saga. And I've often recalled one group of early settlers making a treacherous crossing of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> on a small ship, when their leader, a minister, noted that perhaps their venture would fail and they would become a byword, a footnote, to history. But perhaps, too, with God's help, they might also found a new world, a city upon a hill, a light unto the nations. Those words and that destiny beckon to us still, whether we seek it or not, whether we like it or not, we Americans are keepers of the miracle. We are asked to be guardians of a place to come to, a place to start again, a place to live in the dignity God meant for his children. May it ever be so. Thanks for listening, and God bless you.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address Saturday, as given by Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>.: Good afternoon I'm Sen. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. As a newly elected senator, I am especially honored to be asked by Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> to follow this final weekly radio address of President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Over the last several years, we Democrats have used this time to provide constructive alternatives to the policies of the president and his party. But today, we join with all Americans in honoring and appreciating his stewardship of the highest office in our land. Mr. President, we salute you. Your love of this country and your fervent devotion to freedom inspired us all. You raised the spirit of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and upheld the values of faith, flag and family that we hold so dear. I believe that is why, after eight years, Mr. President, you are even more popular with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people than on the day you were sworn in. Some politicians might find that fact frustrating, but we all should be grateful for it. For without the respect of the people, the president would be powerless, and our country would be left at risk. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is freedom,'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his farewell address this week. As a person whose grandparents came to this country to escape persecution abroad and just last week was sworn in as a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator, I know how real the American promise of freedom and opportunity still is. But I also know that along with opportunity comes challenge, and that is what confronts us now at the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era and the beginning of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, the challenge and opportunity of our future. We are challenged to protect our nation's security while we pursue the opportunity for peace with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. We are challenged to end the plague of drugs and crime, while we endeavor to provide opportunity for our young people to become educated, and trained to join our workforce. We are challenged to reduce the federal deficit while opening opportunities for those afflicted with disease or burdened by poverty. But perhaps our greatest new challenge in the years ahead will come from the natural environment that delimits our world and defines the quality of our lives. When the pilgrim <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Winthrop </PERSON> envisioned the shining city upon the hill, of which the president speaks so eloquently, he looked out upon a continent untouched by smog, hazardous waste and acid rain. In the centuries since that pristine age, we have conquered the continent, but we have also made it dirty and unsafe. The industrial revolution has swept the world, but we have n't swept up behind it Now the decades of neglect have come back to haunt us, and threaten to engulf our children's future, and endanger their health and safety. If we do not meet this challenge, we may face disaster. Holes in the ozone layer and acid in the rain will cause skin cancer and lung disease. Gases in the air will warm the planet and lead to drought in our heartland and flooding along our coast. Waste in our water will make our beaches forbidding places to visit on a summer's day. But there is hope, and it lies, as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would say, with `` we the people.'' The protection of the environment will be high on the agenda of the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the new president not because it makes political sense, but because the people know it makes common sense. People like <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> and <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Gattilia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who built a grass roots environmental movement from the living room of their modest home. A movement that does battle with the large chemical company that pollutes the air in their own backyard and dirties the river where once they would fish and swim. Government ca n't do everything; it must have limits, as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said. But one of the things it can and must do is protect the health and safety of our people. Elimination of pollution in our water, on our land and in the air is a responsibility we in government can not shirk. The people will not allow us to. As President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s time in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> comes to an end and my service in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> here just begins, I must say that I am encouraged and inspired by his sense of patriotism and hope. It moves and binds us all across generations and ideologies, because it is born of shared pride in country, belief in God, and a sense of duty to the people. So let us now set out to work on the unfinished business of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with the spirit of purpose and confidence that is the legacy of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. It is, after all, the same spirit that built this country and will if we protect it, continue to make us a truly great nation.

<TEXT>
 Standing stoically in line for heating fuel, <PERSON> Sadrahmah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bikhar </PERSON> mused on the pullout of Soviet troops, saying simply, `` It's good; I do n't like them.'' It's hard to find anyone who does on the streets of this bleak capital ringed by snowy hills. In random interviews with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, most people were openly hostile toward the Soviets. But asked about the survival prospects of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s Marxist government, many glanced uneasily at the interpreter and bystanders and make noncommittal replies. Instead, they expressed hope _ but little belief _ that the fighting will end when the Soviets leave. Their reluctance to answer certain questions is understandable. In this divided land, official rhetoric remains upbeat, although it contrasts sharply with reality. On Saturday, anti-government guerrillas, known as <ORGANIZATION> Mujahadeen </ORGANIZATION>, attacked a 400-vehicle government supply and ammunition convoy four miles from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Western reporters saw Afghan units dig in on both sides of the Solang highway, a key northern route, and heard rocket fire before government troops opened fire into the hills and the convoy raced past. The same day, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published new triumphant exhortations from the Soviet-backed Marxist administration. In a report on celebrations for the ninth anniversary of the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, it said Gen. <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Farouq </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqubi </PERSON> welcomed <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, declaring, `` We feel ourselves more powerful than ever against the thievish attacks of the intransigent extremists.'' On the streets, <PERSON> Bikhar </PERSON>'s several-hour wait reflected the increasing harassment of the convoys running three times a week on the Solang, now the sole highway supplying the city. As the Soviets have moved out their forces to meet a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> deadline for pulling out all their troops by Feb. 15, guerrillas have approached the capital and stepped up convoy attacks. <PERSON> Bikhar </PERSON> said all he knew was that things were getting worse. Asked what he thought would happen when all the Soviets were gone, he shrugged and said through an interpreter, `` I do n't know. I hope the fighting will stop.'' But there was no doubt in the mind of <LOCATION> Eshaqza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anargul </LOCATION>, a mechanic with the state-owned Afghan Airline, <PERSON> Ariana </PERSON>. `` There will be fighting for another 10 years, maybe longer,'' he said. `` Economically, it will get worse too,'' he added. Armed opposition to the government began soon after it invited the Soviet troops in 1979 in the wake of a Soviet-backed coup. Since then, the war has killed an estimated 1 million people, driven a third of the 15 million Afghans to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and scarred millions more. Amputees are a common sight on the streets of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Tales abound of family members _ troops, guerrillas, and civilians _ killed or missing. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Salom </PERSON>, a turbaned 60-year-old, said he fled his village of <LOCATION> Saraikhoga </LOCATION>, 50 miles from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, after it was damaged in bombing attacks against rebels. He has squeezed into a mud house with relatives in the <LOCATION> Kharkhana </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The area is a mixture of bleak, concrete six-story apartments and slums of mud houses without heat, electricity or water. <PERSON> Salom </PERSON> squats under a blanket in a friend's shop _ a cargo container turned into a makeshift store selling soap, nails, and other items. He is one of about 1 million refugees who have doubled the prewar population of the capital. `` We just want peace,'' he said. `` No Russians, no <ORGANIZATION> Mujahadeen </ORGANIZATION>, no government, just peace.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> agreed Saturday after two years of negotiations to hold new talks on reducing conventional weapons and troops across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The agreement was the final element of an accord designed to enhance freedom in the Soviet bloc and boost East-West contacts. It was initialed after a last-minute compromise solved a dispute between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Diplomats who have spent more than two years haggling over that accord informally accepted it _ minus the mandate for the new arms talks _ Friday. Negotiators at the 35-nation conference said they would formally adopt the final statement Sunday. The conference, to review the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords on economic cooperation and human rights, convened in November 1986 and involved the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and all European nations except <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the talks, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON>, said the arms negotiations could start the week of March 6. They were dubbed CAFE, or talks on Conventional Armed Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> told reporters the mandate for the arms talks was signed by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> negotiators after last-minute telephone calls between <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and the Turkish capital, <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, resulted in a compromise on a Greek-Turkish dispute that stymied diplomats for the past week. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> had objected to the exclusion of a triangle of Turkish territory close to the Syrian border from the arms talks. The territory includes the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Mersin </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> says is used to ship arms to northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, controlled by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> had agreed with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to exclude the territory and feared that reopening the issue might prompt <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to reiterate earlier demands to include the nearby <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base of <LOCATION> Incirlinck </LOCATION> in the talks. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> said the territory was not strategically important in East-West terms. The text of the new mandate left open whether the zone for the new talks would include or exclude <LOCATION> Mersin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> indicated this was deliberately left ambiguous but said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other unidentified states gave undisclosed bilateral assurances to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> over the zone. The new talks will aim to reduce troops, tanks, heavy artillery and other weapons across the continent, from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains deep inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Negotiations on setting up the talks, which do not include naval forces, chemical or nuclear weapons, started in February 1987. Both the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> have said they are eager to begin the negotiations, which will replace the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks going on in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> since 1973. Those talks aimed only to reduce conventional troops and weapons in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Negotiators from both blocs say they are hopeful the new talks will progress much faster, although they are complicated by the difficulties of defining weaponry involved and by verification. The mandate for the new talks now goes into the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> final document, which contains the most detailed human rights agreements ever reached between East and West. Western diplomats hailed the accord but said the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc frequently violated commitments it made on human rights in the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act. The new accord foresees greater freedom for religious believers in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, much more precise regulations on emigration and travel from the East, an end to abuse of psychiatry and to the jamming of Western radio stations, and increased East-West tourism and business deals. It also for the first time creates a mechanism to raise human rights issues at any time on a bilateral level with any other <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> signatory. One of the most disputed issues at the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> conference was a 1991 human rights conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> announced last week they would go, but only on condition that Soviet reforms continue and are institutionalized by then. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> held out on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> until the last minute, seeking exit visas for a Jewish couple in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> refused emigration for 10 years on grounds of national security. Canadian Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said Saturday the Soviets had promised to review the case. Delegates had said they would formally adopt the accord on Saturday, but on Saturday that was pushed back to Sunday. A Western diplomat said the delay was due to East German objections to a word in the German translation of a provision that minimum currency exchange requirements could be abolished in the future. The objection was resolved, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> earns millions of West German marks each year from visitors required to change certain amounts of hard currency and only last week agreed to consider abolishing them in future.

The long-range HH 53C helicopters, based in <LOCATION> Woodbridge-Bentwaters </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, had flown to <ORGANIZATION> Shannon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> on Friday night and took off early Saturday for the flight of more than 200 miles to the vessel. They were refueled en route by two long-range HC-130 Hercules tanker aircraft and reached the Yarrowanga in the early afternoon. In little more than an hour, the first helicopter lifted up 15 people with a winch and the second aircraft hauled up 17 more. The helicopters then headed back to <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> had been monitoring their progress. `` This was a textbook rescue operation,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rescue squad. `` Everything went according to plan. All taken off the stricken ship are in good health, and none of them will need to be hospitalized.'' As the skipper, identified only as Capt. <PERSON> Pietersen </PERSON>, and his wife stepped out of the rescue helicopter, he shook hands with <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> and told him, `` We are all very happy everything went well. It is great to be back on land.'' The rest of the crew was driven to hotels after they were given strict orders not to speak publicly until all reports are made, said an airport official who spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said, `` It is the most dangerous mission I've ever been on. But everything went well.'' Royal Air Force Nimrod reconnaissance planes, designed for long searches at sea, circled the ship Friday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, said a Dutch tug, the Typhoon, was expected to reach the <LOCATION> Yarrowanga </LOCATION> on Sunday and attempt to salvage it. Its Irish agent, shipping broker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dundon </PERSON>, said the ship's owners had sent instructions through him that the crew should abandon ship, even if salvage rights were to be claimed by another party

 The sister of a man who claimed he and five companions survived 35 days in the rubble of the Armenian earthquake says the story was made up so her brother could get into a good hospital, Soviet media reported Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said reporters had tracked down <PERSON> Aikaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Julietta </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> said witnessed his rescue Jan. 11 from the ruins of his nine-story apartment building in the city of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>. Neither officials nor local journalists had been able to find his sister or the five other people reportedly rescued with <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>. They could find no witnesses to the reported rescue. `` At first the sister denied her kinship with <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> but later on acknowledged that it was she who had brought <PERSON> Aikaz </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> hospital and that he really was her brother,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` According to her words, it appears that on Jan. 6 Aikaz requested her to drive him to a good <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> hospital and it was on the way to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that a story of rescue after 35 days was ostensibly invented,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>'s sister made up the rescue story `` because she wanted to put her brother in a good hospital.'' It based its report on an interview with an unidentified <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> resident, who it said was present when <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> spoke to the woman. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted Lt. Col. <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlov </PERSON> of the Armenian civil defense medical service as saying that according to data he had available, <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> was rescued five days after the Dec. 7 earthquake, and that on Jan. 6 he had sought drugs from <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> hospital for an allergy. But he added that there are many people with the last name <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>. However, the news agency said <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>, now in a hospital in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, was sticking to his story and that doctors could not rule out the possibility it was true. It said reporters still had been unable to clarify all details of the case and that <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> had threatened to jump out of the window in his hospital room if reporters did n't leave him alone. Doctors `` regard the threat as quite realisitic,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday the rescue from the ruins of the quake that killed about 25,000 people. That night, the 50-year-old electrician was shown in his hospital bed on Soviet television. But the news agency cast doubt on the story the following day, saying that no witnesses had been found. `` Everyone wanted to believe in the <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> miracle,'' it said. <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> said he and the five others had gone to the basement of the apartment building to haul out two large kegs when the earthquake struck. They were stuck unhurt in a food cellar and survived on canned vegetables, smoked ham, stewed fruit and pickles, he said. He said he sang songs and told stories to the other five to keep their spirits up. <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> was reported to be suffering from pneumonia as a result of the confinement when he was admitted to the hospital. But <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that <PERSON> Gurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Badanyan </PERSON>, whom it identified as the leading Soviet internal medicine specialist, believed <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> had been suffering chronic lung and heart deficiencies for least several years. A psychiatric examination indicated <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> is not mentally ill, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Doctors observed that he mixed up some facts, including the names of children and the number of people who he said were trapped with him. `` Doctors think this is possible as a result of heavy psychological stress. We decided to ask straight whether he was telling the truth. <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> said ` yes' and in a rather confused way repeated his first version,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> correspondents <PERSON> Kirill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dibrova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchglenko </PERSON> wrote. `` Medical specialists do not deny the theoretical possibility that <PERSON> Aikaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> did spend about a month in a basement under the rubble,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s joint celebration Monday of the birthdays of two Confederate generals and a black civil rights leader on Lee-Jackson-King Day is `` the perfect combination of diversity,'' says the man responsible for the merger. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who as a state senator five years ago pushed through the bill making <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Day a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> holiday, says he does n't find it ironic that King shares the holiday with <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> natives <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Stonewall'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` I find no irony in it at all,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, a grandson of slaves and the first black elected to statewide office in the South since Reconstruction, said Friday. `` It shows we are prepared to recognize good men. Men of principle have differed on principle and I think all three were men of principle.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, a civil rights leader who worked with <PERSON> King </PERSON>, said Saturday that <PERSON> King </PERSON> deserves a day all his own because `` <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> stood alone as a giant.'' But he said King would have been amused at being linked with heroes of the Confederacy. `` Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> was very tolerant of things like that,'' <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said. `` If he is looking down from heaven now I can hear him laughing.'' The bill passed the state legislature in 1984 after seven years of effort by <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and often acrimonious debate in public hearings. Opponents objected to honoring a non-Virginian with a holiday when favorite sons such as <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> did not have their own days. Celebrating King's birthday on the third Monday in January, already designated as Lee-Jackson Day, also drew protest. King's birthday is Jan. 15, 1929. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was born Jan. 19, 1807 and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was born Jan. 21, 1824. `` The memory of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is sacred to the hearts of all true Virginians. To replace our heroes with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> or any other non-Virginian is to betray the greatness of our heritage as a commonwealth,'' <PERSON> Forest </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION>, said in 1984. But <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> persisted. `` I have never taken to the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to say one word against <PERSON> Stonewall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' he told his fellow legislators five years ago. `` I have never failed to stand in honor of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. But that cause which is sacred to many Virginians is not sacred to all Virginians.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who is expected to announce his candidacy for governor this month, now minimizes the controversy over the bill, pointing instead to ceremonies around the state honoring King. In <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, for example, a week of activities is being devoted in memory of the slain civil rights leader, including forums, worship services and a touring stage show performing works by black writers. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Day is a state holiday in all states except <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Mississippians honor both <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s and King's birthdays on the same day. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said his group does n't mind how King's birthday is celebrated, as long as it is. A joint holiday is `` better than nothing,'' he said.

 An animal rights activist whose dog mauled a young antelope had to be restrained by a game warden while a state biologist tried to kill the wounded animal by hitting it over the head with heavy pliers. Game Warden <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said she stopped <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauden </PERSON> from interfering with <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Game and Fish Department biologist <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenzel </PERSON>'s attempts to kill the fawn. `` I was giving the fencing pliers to <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> to go ahead and dispatch it while I was starting to walk way with her. She kind of shoved me and grabbed me and we ended up on the ground and I sat on her,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gauden </PERSON>, of Casper, had been walking with her dog in snow-covered Crossroads Park Thursday when the dog attacked the antelope. She called the Game and Fish Department for assistance. When <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guenzel </PERSON> arrived they told her the animal was near death and would have to be killed, <PERSON> Gauden </PERSON> said. She offered to pay for the animal's care and let it graze on her 20 acres of land while it recovered. But the officers said the antelope would n't survive well in care, <PERSON> Gauden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Guenzel </PERSON> tried to kill the antelope with the pliers. The animal did n't die after the first few blows so <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> slit its throat. `` It's the first animal I've seen destroyed that way that did n't immediately die,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said The antelope was badly injured, showing signs of heavy internal bleeding, and had no chance of survival, she said. It had bite marks from the ears to the shoulder blades, punctured intestinal walls and a hide-torn rump.

 The motel where <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was slain has been a focal point for past celebrations, but will not be part of the city's major tributes to the civil rights leader Monday. The <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON>, where King was killed by an assassin's bullet in 1968, is to become the centerpiece of an $ 8.8 million civil rights museum. The crumbling motel has been surrounded for most of the past year by a chain-link fence. King was born Jan. 15, 1929, and the national holiday honoring him is Monday. Promoters of the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> museum had planned to stage a groundbreaking ceremony for the project on the holiday, but it has been delayed until Jan. 27. `` The state needed more time to line up the worker crews that are to begin work that day,'' said <PERSON> D'Army </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, president of a non-profit foundation that took up donations to buy The <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> at a foreclosure auction in 1982. As the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> museum project prepares to go forward, another King institution is undergoing a transition. <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the civil rights leader's widow, will step down as president of The King Center on April 4, to be replaced by her son, <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, directors of the Atlanta-based memorial and policy center announced Saturday. Mrs. King will stay on as chief executive officer and spokesperson for the center, which is devoted to spreading the activist's non-violent policies worldwide. In <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, speeches and memorial services are planned at various locations, including <ORGANIZATION> Clayborn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, where King helped organize a sanitation workers' strike. He was killed while in town to help lead that protest. In past years members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> have gathered at The Lorraine to lay a wreath in King's honor. `` They've got so much stuff going on down here now, I do n't think we need to go down -LRB- to the <LOCATION> Lorraine </LOCATION> -RRB-. In fact, we ca n't even get on the premises,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, president of the federation's Local 1733. The museum project, with funding from the city, county and state, should be finished in 1991, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Lorraine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> plans to turn over title to the motel to the state so it can maintain and run the museum. However, <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON>, leader of an organization called <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, filed a lawsuit last week to keep the state from taking over the building. He said in the <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit that people who gave money to save the motel should be polled to see what they think about the project. While the major King day events will be held elsewhere, a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> group called the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> On </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racism </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a march to the motel. The march is dedicated to <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who has camped out on a sidewalk beside the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> since being evicted from the motel in March to make way for the museum project. <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> employee, contends the project is part of an effort to gentrify the neighborhood, which is dominated by warehouses and rundown rental property. She also has said the memorial would focus on the violence of King's death rather than the peacefulness of his message.

<TEXT>
 Police guarded Wenceslas Square on Saturday to block a memorial service and activists threatened to copy the suicide of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, who burned himself to death in 1969 to protest the Soviet-led invasion. Opposition groups vowed to go ahead with a memorial rally Sunday marking the 20th anniversary of <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s suicide in the square, despite a ban by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> authorities. At least three anonymous letters were received in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> during the past week from an unknown `` Committee for Collective Suicide,'' threatening to emulate <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s act 20 years ago. In an extremely unusual move by authorities, the party daily Rude Pravo published a front-page letter from a professor who taught <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> and later signed the Charter 77 human rights document. He warned against further self-immolation attempts. <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> set himself alight in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s Wenceslas Square on Jan. 16, 1969, to protest the presence of Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> after they invaded to crush the 1968 <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring reforms. <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Machovec </PERSON>, a philosophy professor who taught <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, appealed in his letter to anyone considering a repeat of <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s act. `` I consider it my duty to reiterate ... that dying <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> himself urged young people not to follow him,'' the letter said. It was unprecedented for the Communist daily to print a letter from a Charter 77 signatory. <PERSON> Machovec </PERSON> is also a member of the recently formed <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and of the <ORGANIZATION> Masaryk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, but his dissident affiliations were not mentioned in Rude Pravo. <PERSON> Machovec </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, founder of the Czechoslovak state in 1918, as saying suicide `` and similar extreme acts are rather cheap and that real bravery is patient work and life.'' <PERSON> Zdenek </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON>, the head of an official human rights commitee founded last month, also received one of the self-immolation threats. The commitee warned that a demonstrative suicide `` is a very inhuman and immoral act'' and called for dialogue with the unknown authors of the letter. Communist authorities in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> banned the rally last week. The independent groups said they would hold the protest anyway. Police began guarding the square early Saturday morning. Similar tight security was in force August and October, when thousands of people took part in banned rallies later broken up by police. A comment by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> carried by several official newspapers Saturday charged that <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s death was not his own choice. `` The adventurers who have deceitfully made him commit suicide counted only on explosion of passions and emotions inside the country,'' it said. `` It seems that the present handful of organizers of anti-Socialist actions in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> tries to reach similar objectives at any cost.'' Earlier this week, police confiscated a death mask sculpted by <PERSON> Olbram </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoubek </PERSON>, who made a tombstone for <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s grave 20 years ago, activists in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> said. Activists have said Sunday afternoon's meeting was planned as a brief commemorative act, with leading dissidents laying flowers and lighting candles at the King Wenceslas statue where <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> set himself on fire. Charter 77, one of five groups which called Sunday's rally, also plans a vigil at <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s grave on Jan. 21 in the village of <LOCATION> Vsetaty </LOCATION>, about 18 miles north of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. His body was exhumed from the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> cemetery and reburied at <LOCATION> Vsetaty </LOCATION> in 1973. His Prague grave had often been heaped with flowers and burning candles until the body was removed.

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> has won his first battle in a war with the bosses of the <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful but reportedly the most corrupt union in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In a bold move Tuesday, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> had union leader <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> and 50 of his associates arrested on charges ranging from illegal possession of guns to tax evasion and homicide. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of 40 years. More arrests are expected soon, a source in the attorney general's office told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> planned to `` clean up the situation.'' `` We do not want to make it look like a witch hunt,'' a government source said on condition of anonymity, `` but this is not the end.'' A likely additional charge is `` unexplained wealth.'' The government has ordered banks to freeze accounts of the top leaders. It was the new president's first confrontation with the powerful Mexican unions, and he picked a foe past presidents, fearful of his power, had left alone. Critics in and outside the government claim union chiefs led by <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quina </ORGANIZATION> _ the diminutive by which <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> is known _ amassed fortunes, controlled lives and sold jobs in a paternalistic system that built loyalities and gave bosses political leverage in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> To appease the union, the party gives it an unofficial power quota by nominating as legislators union members who then are almost assured of victory. Despite losses in July 6 elections, the union has one senator and seven representatives. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> also had his men as chiefs of police, judges and city councilors in oil regions. Officials say <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> is a volatile leader who blackmailed government administrations through his union power and control over the state oil monopoly, <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, which at one time was forced to grant the union 40 percent of its contract work. Much of the work was done by companies set up by the union boss and his associates. He frequently has been called repressive and authoritarian and is accused of fraud, nepotism, even murder. Unexplained deaths and beatings of those opposed to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quina </LOCATION> publicly have been blamed on him and his men, though none of them ever has been charged in the incidents. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> always dismisses such allegations as attempts by jealous foes trying to turn the president against him and the union. Two bodyguards arrested with him last week have signed statements saying they killed another labor leader on <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>'s orders, according to the attorney general's office On Jan. 3, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> threatened to call a general strike if the government `` yielded as much as one millimeter of the oil industry to private business.'' The statement did not endear him to a president who has said the state will retain control of the oil industry but seek private domestic investment in related secondary industries. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> opposed the nomination of <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, the man responsible for eliminating many union privileges when he was budget and planning secretary. The 66-year-old union chief, a welder who took over the union in 1964 and saw his power expand as the oil industry became <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s top source of foreign income, was a revered figure who dispensed favors to the rank and file, had children named after him and was generous to schools and churches But he also traveled with a personal escort of 35 armed men, said a federal investigator. `` He was ruthless,'' said <PERSON> Maximo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, leader of a small group in the union that opposes <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>. `` He would crush opposition, post armed men at union meetings and hold three-minute sessions to ram through what he wanted.'' His arrest Tuesday caused a one-day walkout by union members at most oil installations, but soon other labor unions offered their support to <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>. Some leftist parties accused the government of repression and joined a few thousand oil workers in a march Thursday. Press reaction favors the president, as does private business. `` We must remember the oil leaders' arrogance, how they have challenged presidents with insolence ... We must remember their excessive salaries, their avarice, how the union thought itself the owner of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s petroleum,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper that often criticizes the government. `` He was a monster created by the governmment and the government in the end cut off his head,'' said <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>. `` But the body is still twitching.''

<HEAD>``Saturday's Will Never Seem The Same,'' President Says In Last Radio
Talk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> delivered his 331st, and last, radio address as president on Saturday, telling his listeners he was grateful to have played a part in `` the story of a people and a cause ... the American saga.'' `` Believe me, Saturdays will never seem the same. I'll miss you,'' the president said as he read his five-minute address from the Oval Office. `` Over the years I've greatly enjoyed this opportunity to get together with you, and report on the week's events here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said the one-time radio sportscaster and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> actor. He started the Saturday series on April 3, 1982. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted that he and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> planned to return home to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> after the inauguration of President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday. `` We go with full hearts, with best wishes for <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and with gratitude to all of you. It's been a privilege to serve the people and the nation we've always loved, and loved so much today,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We shared a great deal together. For me, it's been a special relationship.'' Several hours after delivering his address, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> departed for an overnight stay at the presidential retreat in Camp David. In a first, the president and his wife traveled aboard a new, $ 14 million <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> helicopter that has been designed for presidential use. The sleek new craft is to be used for shorter distances and on international trips because it is small enough to be transported overseas in cargo aircraft. In his radio address, the president said he was n't leaving with a downcast spirit, asserting that the economy was booming, the nation's social problems were being dealt with and `` the Soviet menace shows some sign of relenting.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his eight-year presidency was only part of `` a far larger story, the story of a people and a cause ... the hope of human freedom, the quest for it, the achievement of it, is the American saga.'' `` Whether we seek it or not, whether we like it or not, we Americans are keepers of the miracle. We are asked to be guardians of a place to come to, a place to start again, a place to live in the dignity God meant for his children. May it ever be so,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. The president began his script with the traditional greeting, `` My fellow Americans,'' and ended it as he always has: `` Thanks for listening. And God bless you.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first job was as a sports broadcaster in <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and radio gave him the exposure that helped him launch a career in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. As an actor-turned-politician, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> honed his radio style for use as a political tool during his days as the governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Over the years, it has been difficult to calculate how many people hear the president's live, noontime address, since many of the radio networks that have carried it only `` feed'' it to their subscribers, who either replay it at their leisure or do not air it at all. The only time the president was assured his voice would be carried came during the 1984 campaign, when his campaign purchased the air time. The president personally chose themes for his addresses. Occasionally, he dominated the news, as on the Saturday he used the folksy-style addresses to announce the reappointment of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, or the time he announced suspension of a preferential trading status for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the wake of the communist government's suppression of the Solidarity labor union. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s most infamous remarks came outside the formal radio address, when he announced prior to one speech from his ranch in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that he had `` just signed legislation that will outlaw <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> forever. The bombing begins in five minutes.'' The president has a habit of joking with his aides prior to the talk, and the remarks were made during a voice check when the microphone was turned on but he was not yet on the air. The remarks were heard by the radio `` pool'' that was transmitting it to the other networks.

<HEAD>Navy Reduces Persian Gulf Force Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval force in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> is being trimmed again, leaving the fleet with six surface fighting ships, the lowest number since the mid-1987 buildup that began as the Iraq-Iran war escalated. As the missile cruiser USS <PERSON> Josephus </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> and three missile frigates departed the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in recent days, three newly arriving vessels entered the waterway to begin their three-month duty tours. The three-for-four swap effectively reduced the Gulf-based fleet from 15 to 14 ships and pared the number of surface combatants _ cruisers, destroyers and frigates _ from seven to six. The total of 14 is the lowest number of American warships in the Gulf since July 1987. It also includes six minesweepers, an amphibious landing ship that serves as their `` mother ship'' and the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salle </LOCATION>, flagship of the Joint Task Force Middle East. Another ten ships, a battle group built around the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION>, remains on station in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. It is to be replaced by another carrier group, headed by the USS Constellation, at the end of the month. The force inside the Gulf is slowly being reduced in strength following the Iraq-Iran cease-fire that went into effect last August. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources say a carrier group will be operating in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> for the foreseeable future. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Friday that the <PERSON> Josephus </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> was being withdrawn because it was `` no longer required to meet the threat to our forces and shipping in the region.'' In fact, the departure of the <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> did not reflect a sudden decision to reduce the force. The 8,200-ton cruiser, based at <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was scheduled to leave the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Jan. 8, along with three other East Coast-based ships, the frigates <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. As those four ships sailed out of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in recent days, their patrol responsibilities were taken over by the destroyer <PERSON> O'Bannon </PERSON> and the frigates <PERSON> Hawes </PERSON> and <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Wert </PERSON>, all based at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, S.C. The frigate Klakring, originally slated for deployment along with those three, had its orders canceled in December. Officials said at the time that the resulting force reduction of one ship was seen as a `` prudent move ... considering the situation'' since the cease-fire. With the arrival of the newcomers, the mix in the Gulf includes the <LOCATION> Hawes </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Wert </PERSON> and another missile frigate, the Reid, as well as the <PERSON> O'Bannon </PERSON> and another destroyer, the <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, plus the missile cruiser <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier scaled back its operations in the Gulf from direct escorting of U.S.-flagged tankers to a system of `` monitoring'' their movements from a distance. It also has curtailed air patrols and, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, recently withdrew one of the four AWACs, or airborne surveillance aircraft, based in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> during the last year of the Iraq-Iran war. There have been no armed incidents in the Gulf since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-brokered </LOCATION> truce went into effect Aug. 20, and other foreign navies have been pulling out their forces. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> disclosed earlier in the week that it planned to withdraw its last three minesweepers by March, leaving it with a three-ship patrol unit. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> are withdrawing entirely, and the French have cut their regional force to reflect the reduced tensions in the waterway since the 8-year war ended. Although the cease-fire has worked, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said during a visit to the Gulf on Dec. 5 that there was `` no plan for major changes in our force structure'' as long as <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> failed to make any progress toward a negotiated peace. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have made it clear that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to maintain a permanent force in the Gulf, at least at the level of four to six warships that were assigned there before the 1987 buildup. The continued presence of a Soviet fleet, some seven to ten warships, is seen as an important factor affecting the rate at which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will reduce its <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> force, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources say. In any case, those sources say, any cutbacks would not include the six minesweepers sent to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in late 1987 to deal with a growing threat of mines planted by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in shipping lanes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials insist that a mine threat still exists, mainly in the northern Gulf, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is still debating what to do with the wooden-hulled, Korean War vintage minesweepers.

 Relatives of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilot killed in the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> said Saturday they do n't trust <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and want an autopsy performed on the body to be certain it is the flier's. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> telephoned the <PERSON> Ribas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominicci </PERSON> family in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> on Friday night to inform them the body released by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had been identified in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> as that of <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominicci </PERSON>. The 33-year-old airman was killed during the April 15, 1986 raids on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` After getting over this shock, we have asked the Pentagon for a complete autopsy to know the cause of his death,'' `` said the slain pilot's brother, <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He said he also wants a family doctor to certify whether it is <PERSON> Ribas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominicci </PERSON>'s body. Libyan authorities turned over the body Friday to the papal representative in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. They said it belonged to Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ribas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominicci </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Utuado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, piloted the F-111 bomber that was the only plane lost in the raids on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The other body was never found, the Libyans said. `` They were only four inches apart in the cabin,'' said the brother, a 38-year-old attorney who spoke by telephone from the western city of <LOCATION> Mayaguez </LOCATION>, 80 miles west of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. The pilot was the youngest of six brothers. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominicci </PERSON> also left a wife, <PERSON> Blanca </PERSON>, and a son, also named <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON>, who is now 7 years old. They live in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> quoted an Italian forensic expert among three Italians and three Americans who helped identify the body as saying, `` The identification was made possible on the basis of the comparision of teeth'' with documents provided by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said the body was well preserved. <PERSON> Ribas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominicci </PERSON> said the family has doubts because of a Libyan television report and pictures of the body when it was found, three months after the raid. The broadcast said the body had been washed ashore and identified it as <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON>'s. `` No body is in good condition after floating in the water for three months,'' said <PERSON> Ribas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominicci </PERSON>. He said the family also is skeptical of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s motives, saying it could be a publicity stunt. `` With Ghadhafi, I do n't discard any possibility,'' he said. <PERSON> Ribas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominicci </PERSON> said his 87-year-old father had not been told of the development because he is ill. `` This is like reliving a sad episode,'' he said

 As <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> prepares to leave the pomp and pageantry of eight years in the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, she wants to be remembered for her work against drug abuse rather than her penchant for borrowing high-priced, designer gowns. `` I'm very happy that I was able to help the -LRB- fashion -RRB- industry, but I hope that's not the thing I'm remembered for. I hope I'm remembered for the drug program and the help to children,'' the first lady said Her voice reduced to a mere whisper by a severe bout of laryngitis, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reviewed the ups and downs of her years in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a 45-minute farewell interview on Thursday with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Sipping coffee from a delicate white and gold china cup in the Yellow Oval Room of the mansion's private quarters, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> discussed the disclosure that she had ignored the pledge she made in 1982 to abstain from borrowing high-priced designer clothes and gowns. `` I was just trying to help an industry that I could help and I was in the position to help. I did n't see anything wrong with that,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s top designers have given her their `` Lifetime Achievement Award'' for her contribution to the fashion industry. `` Whenever anybody talked about fashion, they would think French, Dior, whatever. They never thought about American. Well, now American designers are taken seriously abroad. There is a competition that is just wonderful,'' the first lady said. Attempting to counter critics who have said her actions amounted to free advertising for several of her favorite designers, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> insisted: `` I was n't advertising for these people. I was trying to promote and help one of the biggest industries in our country. ... They are all very grateful, and nobody saw anything wrong with it.'' Turning to the work she wants to be identified with, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she has had some silent victories in her battle against drug abuse, receiving `` a lot of letters from kids ... or parents that I've been able to help'' in instances that few people know about. She said she regretted that `` there's always those kids that you have n't been able to get to, and you have n't been able to reach.'' She added that she intended to keep working through the anti-drug abuse center named after her that is to be built near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I do n't believe in retirement,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she was saddened to learn that <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a 16-year-old suffering from cancer who had visited her a week before Christmas through the `` Make-A-Wish'' foundation, had died. `` He said he wanted to come here ... he said, ` I've seen you on television, and I want to tell you that I admire you, and I know that you've been a great support to your husband,''' she said, her voice softening. `` He died on Christmas Day.'' Queried about criticism from consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> that she and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have not included warnings against tobacco in their lectures against drug abuse, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held up a finger for emphasis. `` I agree with him,'' she said. `` It's as addictive as any of the other drugs, -LRB- including -RRB- alcohol.'' The first lady went on to say she hoped one of her aides, a smoker who was present in the room, `` is listening.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been known to rigorously keep after White House personnel who smoke, insisting they get help to kick their habit. Looking back over her eight years in the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she had not anticipated that life in the executive mansion `` would be as confining'' as it turned out to be. `` Certainly after <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s shooting, -LRB- in March 1981 -RRB- everything tightened up,'' she said. `` It always bothered <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> that he created such a to-do when we went to a restaurant. And this entourage of cars _ that always bothered him,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of the 20-plus vehicles that the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> organizes for a presidential motorcade. President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> are expected to keep up their active social life, and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she hoped `` they'll find their own way'' to get out and about, despite security concerns Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she and her husband `` are happy'' they will continue to receive <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection after they leave the White House. One subject Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> refused to discuss was former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s revelation that she had used an astrologer to help formulate the president's schedule. `` Read my book,'' she quipped, promising to deal with the subject in her memoirs, which she said are due out in the fall. Of <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who blamed the first lady for organizing his ouster in the wake of allegations he had mismanaged the White House during the Iran-Contra affair, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was curt. Asked if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was happy with his former aide, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said simply, `` He's not.'' Asked if she'd changed her mind about <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who was harshly critical of her involvement in White House affairs in his book, `` For the Record,'' she whispered, `` No.'' Of the `` kiss-and-tell'' books that many <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aides have written, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she finds them to be `` reckless kinds of books.'' `` I think they're terrible. ... there's an implied trust, and when you leave and write these books, you're breaking that trust,'' she said. The first lady said she has a formula for dealing with such books, including any that come out in the future. `` I wo n't read them,'' she said, with stern look. `` I have n't read any of the others. The first lady said the barrage of criticism she'd encountered upon entering the White House _ spurred by stories about her privately-funded purchases of $ 209,000 of new china and a $ 730,000 redecoration of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ had been `` a big surprise.'' `` I had one disadvantage that <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> did n't have. I came in with terrible press,'' she said. `` I never had that before. ... It made me pull back. ... There was a hurdle on both sides.. you all getting to know me and my getting to be a little hesitant, afraid. Even eight years later, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> still appeared upset about reports that she wanted President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON> to move out of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> prior to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> inauguration. `` I never said that,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, again her finger pointing for emphasis. As she rose to leave, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was eager to offer some `` word of wisdom'' for future first ladies, as well as all married women: `` Do your own thing. Do n't be afraid to give your opinion. Just because you're married does n't mean you've given up your right to have an opinion.''

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Kremlin took direct control of a region claimed by two rival republics, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Saturday, in the government's most determined bid to calm its worst pocket of ethnic unrest. The decree keeps the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region within the southern republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and rejects demands that it become part of the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> are mainly Christian and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> is predominately Moslem. A commission led by <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s representative in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s troubled region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, can suspend local governing councils, administrative bodies and informal organizations, and oversee the mass media, publishing, health and education, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The declaration was adopted `` in connection with the persistent strain in inter-ethnic relations in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and around it with a view to preventing their further aggravation and to stabilizing the situation in the region,'' the official news agency said. The decision was made Thursday by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's highest executive body, but released only Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Previous reports had said only that a `` special situation'' had been imposed on <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The decree was billed as a temporary measure but did not say how long it will last or when new elections will be held. It did not say who besides <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON> will serve on the committee. More than 60 people have been killed and about 200,000 have fled their homes as a result of the dispute that flared up in February 1988 over control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have rejected annexation, and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> instead opted for a long-term economic and social development program. But that has not stopped the unrest, which last erupted into violence in mid-November. Military rule and a strict curfew was imposed on the Armenian capital <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> capital <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, and other cities. Top Kremlin officials, including President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, have reacted angrily to demands for annexation that have continued after the Dec. 7 earthquake that devastated northern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and killed about 25,000 people. Armenian activists say several of their leaders have been arrested and held in administrative detention. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that under the decree the powers of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s legislature and executive bodies `` shall be suspended until the holding of elections of a new composition of the Soviet `` The committee shall be entrusted with the task of being in charge of the local bodies of state power and administration of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>,'' it said. Courts and prosecutors in the disputed territory will work under new regulations to be imposed by the procurator-general, <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The committee shall have the right to suspend the activities of public organizations and independently-acting associations if they run counter to the Constitution and legislation of the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>, or, if necessary, to dissolve them,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Four Terrorists Sentenced to Life For Renault Assassination</HEAD>

 A court Saturday convicted four leading members of a left-wing terrorist group of murdering <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Besse </PERSON> and sentenced them to life in prison. <PERSON> Nathalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Menigon </PERSON>, 31 and <PERSON> Joelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubron </PERSON>, 28, were convicted of carrying out the shooting death of the <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> chief on Nov. 17, 1986. <PERSON> Menigon </PERSON>'s companion, <PERSON> Jean-Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouillan </PERSON>, 33, and <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipriani </PERSON>, 38, were convicted of complicity. Seven judges, concurring to demands of State Prosecutor <PERSON> Galiber </PERSON> d'Auque, ruled the four must spend at least 18 years behind bars before they are eligible for parole. The panel, which sits only on terrorism cases, deliberated for 75 minutes after hearing five days of testimony. The defendants had boycotted the court since the second day of the trial. None was present when the verdict was read. All four are top members of <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, which started as a French group that bombed French institutions, usually during the night when buildings were empty and no one could be hurt. But over the last few years, a deadly <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> branch has evolved with links to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s Communist Fighting Cells The group was largely rendered ineffective when the four were arrested at a farm south of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and all their documents were confiscated. Among them was the original draft of a statement claiming responsibility for <PERSON> Besse </PERSON>'s assassination. Police also found weapons allegedly used in the killing and a piece of the black suit <PERSON> Besse </PERSON> was wearing when he died. The auto executive was killed near his home in southern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> as he returned from work. Direct Action pamphlets were found in a nearby subway station, but the group did not formally claim responsibility for the murder until Feb. 11, nearly three months later. <PERSON> Besse </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Francoise </PERSON>, and their five children attended the week's hearings. `` The most important thing for me is that this trial took place, and with dignity,'' she said, refusing to comment on the verdicts.

 Two African students were released Saturday after spending two weeks in prison for allegedly participating in a fight with Chinese that sparked racial unrest in four cities. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Dossoumou </PERSON> <PERSON> Boni </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodovic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alpha </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION> were freed one day before their 15-day sentence was to end. It said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> thanked his prison guards. A Congolese student at <ORGANIZATION> Hehai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> said the two men had gone to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and had been given until Tuesday to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Their whereabouts in the capital were not immediately known. The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said most of <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>'s 139 African students continued to boycott classes and wanted to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report said that <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzabaku </PERSON> <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON>, a student from <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> who also was arrested in connection with the Christmas Eve brawl, was released from jail on Jan. 10 and put under house arrest at <LOCATION> Hehai </LOCATION>. But the Congolese student said the report was false. `` Dosoo is not at <LOCATION> Hehai </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` The men released today said he is still in jail.'' The Ghanian Embassy has demanded <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON>'s release and has threatened to withdraw all of its 26 students from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It is the only African country to do so. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report said three <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> also have been given 15-day sentences in connection with the brawl. Racial unrest erupted in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Christmas Eve when African students fought Chinese after doorkeepers refused to let two <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> women attend an African party. The fight touched off five days of anti-black protests in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> during which angry mobs of Chinese youth threw rocks and bottles at African student dormitories and shouted `` Down with black devils.'' As the week wore on, the protests lost much of their racist flavor and began turning against the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government. A strong police presence in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> soon quelled the marches. The unrest spread to <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> in the east, the central industrial city of <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. A 10-day class boycott by African students in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> ended on Jan. 5. On Saturday, some of the 500 African students at the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Languages </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> remained on strike. In <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION>, one foreign student was injured when a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> youth threw a rock through his window on Dec. 29. The three African students were arrested on Dec. 31 by about 400 Chinese militiamen who attacked a guest house on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>. Most of the African students from <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> had been forced to the guest house on Dec. 26 by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> police who refused to allow them to travel to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. African students allege that during the arrests Chinese paramilitary forces used electric truncheons to shock and beat the African students. The Chinese have denied the charge. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report quoted <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiju </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hehai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, as saying he believed `` the foreign students in our university are still kids.'' `` I hope they will return to their normal school activities as soon as possible,'' he said. About 1,500 Africans receive Chinese scholarships as part of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s policy to emphasize its ties to the Third World.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet Saturday carried homeward the body of an American pilot killed three years ago in the bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which said it released the remains as a `` humanitarian initiative.''

The body has been well preserved and medical authorities checked the identity with dental and fingerprint records, the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> on Friday reported that only one body was ever found after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter jets bombed the Libyan capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>, another coastal city. <PERSON> Ribas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominicci </PERSON> said the family was shocked when it was told that the body flown out of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had been identified as his brother. `` We have asked the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to do a complete autopsy to know the cause of his death,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Mayaguez </LOCATION> city, 80 miles west of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. `` This is like reliving a sad episode in our lives,'' he added. He said he also wants a family doctor to certify that it is his brother's body. Returned with the body were a wedding ring, 14 bullets, a knife, a cigarette lighter, $ 59 and 10 British pounds -LRB- worth about $ 18 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Lt. <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Dover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, said the body was taken first to the <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Titunik </PERSON>, said the remains would be flown from there to <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Ribas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominicci </PERSON> said the family was told there would be a military ceremony when the body arrived at <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>. Six blue-uniformed <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> solemnly carried the flag-draped casket to a C-141 transport plane at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ciampino </LOCATION> airport. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON> and Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Creagan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> placed hand over heart as the coffin passed them.

This came during a period of international debate over a Libyan plant the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says can produce chemical weapons, and nine days after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighters shot down two Libyan jets over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter planes buzzed a <ORGANIZATION> Libyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane flying to <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> on Tuesday.

 From pork rinds to power boats, from 7:15 a.m. workday starts to spur-of-the-moment shopping jaunts, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already is setting a pace and a style far different from the man he will succeed. The nation's 41st president is a man of aristocratic breeding and down-home tastes. He enjoys country music, dropping by <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> to buy power tools, jogging a mile or two. His drink of choice is a vodka martini, his idea of competitive sports is a good game of horseshoes, his suits are tailor-made. During his campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> often joked that one of his hardest tasks during eight years as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vice president was `` keeping my charisma in check.'' As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nears his inauguration, he has exhibited a salty, easygoing confidence that, if not everyone's idea of charisma, is at least sharply at odds with the onetime perception of him as awkward in public, whiny of voice, and wimpy in demeanor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still speaks in bursts and with a syntax that is often haphazard. He sprinkles his conversation with phrases such as `` going ballistic'' and `` I'm not going to get all tense,'' and talks about `` the drug thing'' or the `` Persian Gulf thing.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seems far more at ease with himself now, and has exhibited a quick-wittedness, particularly in his dealings with reporters, that seemed to be missing in the past. After avoiding regular contact with reporters during his campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now admits that he relishes the give-and-take of news conferences, and has held a dozen or so of them since his election. His humor is often self-deprecating, as when a reporter recently began a question: `` Mr. Vice President. Do you ever stop to think _'' `` Not often,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> interrupted. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 64, said in a recent interview that he shared with wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> upon rising one morning a few days ago a sudden revelation: `` I feel excited about this job.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made it clear he intends to be up and about _ a prospect that must make the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> nervous and which does n't make reporters' jobs any easier. `` I'm not going to be isolated and cut off. Say I want to go buy a suit. I want to eat Peking duck. And I do n't want to have to spend a lot of time worrying about where people are. I want to say, ` I'm ready to go, let's go,'' he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s forays into town are becoming legendary _ remindful of the unannounced trips President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> used to take. He buys bagels at a local delicatessen, makes frequent trips to a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> men's shop to be fitted for suits, goes out himself to buy presents for his wife, and often drops by the local <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> to pick up a few groceries. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> enjoys playing tennis with his family and with tennis pros, and as vice president and president-elect often dropped in unannounced at the gymnasium in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rayburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> to work out with former colleagues. He enjoys restaurants, often lingering for hours over meals with friends and guests. In his beloved vacation home of <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> frequently takes unannounced walks through the village, patronizes local shops, takes his boat out for a spin, goes fishing, jogs through the neighborhood. At his oceanside family compound, he uses one cottage as an office, where he does his own typing on an electric typerwriter set up at his desk. On a recent visit, he shushed reporters asking him questions while he was fishing in a local river _ telling them not to scare away the fish. However, he admitted, he never caught fish at that particular spot anyway. So why did he return there? `` I like to cast,'' he said. He also enjoys throttling up his sleek 28-foot Cigarette boat, `` Fidelity,'' crashing through <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> waves at speeds up to 50 mph, sometimes appearing to relish in leaving a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> `` chase'' boat in his spray. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kept the boat in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, one summer, he says he has no plans to move it to the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> when he moves to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ that would n't do justice to the ocean-going craft, he says, comparing it to a thoroughbred horse. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seems certain to continue his visits to the family estate in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> during warm weather, he has indicated he plans to spend a lot of time at Camp David, the presidential retreat in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>; and is reportedly eyeing the purchase of a condominium in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, where he enjoys fishing. The former oil industry executive, while claiming <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as his adopted home, does not back away from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> roots or his good fortune at birth, once joking that his forefathers had come on the Mayflower _ you could tell them because they all were holding <PERSON> Bloomingdale </PERSON>'s shopping bags, he said. But at the same time, he's a man who enjoys country music, watching rented video tapes and who sometimes drives around the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> grounds, where the vice presidential residence is located, because he's chauffeured everywhere else. Then there's the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family enthusiasm for sports _ from tennis to horseshoes. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talks about a `` six pack,'' he's not talking beer _ although he's been known to enjoy one on occasion _ but about wrapping successive horseshoes around the pole. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once even suggested that horseshoes was `` the national sport,'' and has hinted he plans to install a horseshoe pit on the White House grounds. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, trim at six-foot-two, runs several times a week, usually doing about two miles at a time. And, while he is known to enjoy fine meals in good restaurants, he also has a fondness for junk food _ downing pork rinds and smothering nearly everything in hot sauce, even tuna fish sandwiches. The diet does n't seem to have hurt his health. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has an enviable cholesterol count of 192. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is being sworn in as president after serving as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vice president since 1981 It will be the first time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has served in elective office, in his own right, since he represented <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1960s. In the years since, he served in a string of high-level appointive posts, including ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, envoy to the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.

 Two Palestinian girls died Saturday from bullet wounds suffered in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, and troops in the occupied lands wounded at least 19 other Arabs, hospital and army officials said. The deaths brought to four the number of young Arabs killed by army gunfire in two days and raised to 355 the number of Palestinians killed in the 13-month-old uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Fifteen Israelis have died. In annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police fired tear gas to disperse Arab stone-throwers. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said authorities safely dismantled a bomb left at a major road junction near the city. In east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, 14-year-old <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Masri </PERSON> died of wounds suffered in a Jan. 7 clash in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the army said. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said she was shot in the head with a plastic bullet. Residents in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> called a strike to mourn the girl's death, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> students left schools to march in protest of the killing, an Arab reporter in the city said. Arab hospital officials reported 16 Palestinians wounded in clashes with troops Saturday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The army confirmed seven wounded in those areas, plus three in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. Most of the wounded were teen-agers. A 12-year-old Palestinian girl, <PERSON> Hanadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Sultan </PERSON>, died at the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> after troops shot her in the head in a Jan. 10 clash at the <LOCATION> Shati </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the military command said. On Friday, two 15-year-old Palestinians died after being shot by troops in clashes. The army, in an apparent effort to prevent disturbances, clamped a curfew on Shati, a beachside shantytown in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> housing about 42,000 Palestinians. Curfews were also imposed on <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> el-Balah and Nuseirat camps, which have a combined population of almost 100,000. But Palestinian protests, sparked by the death of Ms. <PERSON> Abu-Sultan </PERSON> and another <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> teenager a day before, erupted in many areas of the southern strip. Merchants in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> continued a commercial strike begun Friday to protest <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> raids to collect taxes. Non-payment of taxes is a major tactic of the revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Also Saturday, a senior Israeli defense official, <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubrani </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has not conducted any attacks against northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism.

But <PERSON> Lubrani </PERSON> said he could not yet assess the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> position. `` I think it is too early to judge, and time will say,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` At the moment, they are leaning somehow toward a status quo, no violent actions. But how long this will last I can not tell you. This can last until tonight.''

<HEAD>Black Officers Targets Of Racism Within San Bernardino Police Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The mayor has promised to fire those responsible for placing racist letters in the lockers of two black policemen threatening them with violence if they took a promotional exam. The incident was revealed Friday by Police Chief <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, who also promised to request an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation if those responsible do n't come forward within a week. `` The unacceptable conduct exhibited was blatant racial bigotry against two black officers,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Evlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>. `` The person or persons involved used threats and written language of the lowest order.'' Officials said an internal investigation is focusing on employees of the police department, and Ms. <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said those identified as the letters' writers would be fired. The mayor also issued a public apology to the officers, who were not identified. The letters, signed by a group calling itself the `` <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>,'' threatened to harm the officers and their families if they took an oral examination they must pass to be considered for promotion to the rank of corporal. Both officers took the test. The incident was the latest of several in which black officers in this city of 900,000 some 55 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> have been threatened or harassed anonymously by others in the department, officials said. Several weeks ago, a black patrolman found black shoe polish smeared in his locker, officials said. A few days after that, the same officer found his locker sprayed with black paint. That officer also took the promotional exam. The letters the other two officers received said the <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> had infiltrated the Police Department's five-member oral exam board and had already decided which officers would be promoted, City Councilman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Minor </PERSON> said Approximately 70 officers have applied for three openings. Councilman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Maudsley </PERSON> discounted the possibility the board had been infiltrated, however, noting one board member is black.

 Leftist guerrillas ambushed a group of goldminers in a jungle village and killed 15 people, police said Saturday. The miners were walking to their barracks Thursday in the small town of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, about 433 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, when a column of 50 guerrillas opened fire with machine guns, police said. Police blamed the Maoist Shining Path movement.

The miners were part of a predominately <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> labor force that works the gold-bearing jungle rivers. Police said it was unclear why the guerrillas attacked the miners and gave no more details on the massacre.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> made its first direct contact with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and discussed the formation of a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference, but drew criticism on Saturday from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign affairs minister who met with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> Friday night, also planned to meet Monday with <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Chedli </PERSON> <PERSON> Klibi </PERSON>, the Tunis-based organization said Saturday. <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> said his two-hour meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` constitutes a major development in the policies of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' The talks demonstrated that the world was changing and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` had to change as well or it would risk being left behind,'' said <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>, who is to visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in early March. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> characterized the talks, held at the home of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> representative <PERSON> Hakam </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaoui </PERSON>, as `` fruitful, constructive and useful.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Yoav </PERSON> <PERSON> Biran </PERSON> said Saturday he regretted what he called the `` unwarranted rush of British politicians'' to meet <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The road towards peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> does not lead through the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Behind the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s ` charm offensive' directed at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, this organization adheres to its unchanged policies by words that are directed at Arab audiences and by continued attempts at terrorism directed at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said on Friday that the British were well aware of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s attitude toward the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> opposes an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and refuses to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it maintains is a terrorist organization. <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who met with reporters after their talks, agreed that any <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace conference should be sponsored by the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said other participants should include `` all concerned parties, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or our provisional government, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>.'' It was the first time <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> mentioned the possibility of a provisional government sitting at a peace conference in the name of Palestinians since the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a sort of parliament-in-exile for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, decided to establish one at a meeting in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> Nov. 15. Asked how <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> could help bring about an international conference, <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> said he did not want to exaggerate his country's role. But he added that <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> has special contacts with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, other European governments and a number of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> gave the go-ahead for the meeting after the <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s public renunciation of terrorism and implicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION>'s right to exist in December. `` The intefadeh has had an extraordinary effect on international public opinion and on <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in particular,'' <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> added, referring to more than a year of unrest by Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. At least 355 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the violence. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ruled Palestine before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was established in 1948.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lawmakers met Saturday with hundreds of Nicaraguan immigrants living at a stadium to pledge support but warned that funds to help refugees assimilate `` do n't come easily.'' Newly elected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> visited the <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> to examine the problems facing the growing number of Nicaraguan arrivals. A total of 263 Nicaraguans are living at the stadium. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, pledged his efforts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` so that <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> wo n't have to take on alone the financial burden of these new refugee arrivals.'' `` The reality is that those -LRB- federal -RRB- funds do n't come easily'' to help find jobs and homes for immigrants streaming across the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and seeking political asylum, said <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a Republican from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION>. `` But it is important that we understand a lot must be done to find a solution to the problem,'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said through <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, who acted as an interpreter. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officials are worried that the latest wave of Nicaraguans pouring into the city will overburden facilities like schools and hospitals. The Central Americans began arriving from southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by the busload Thursday and Friday, following a federal judge's ruling that the government could not keep them there while their applications for political asylum were being processed. The Nicaraguans maintain that they are fleeing oppression by their country's leftist Sandinista government. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the immigrants are not eligible for asylum if they actually are fleeing bad economic conditions in their homeland, which has been hurt by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo. Since the judge's decision Monday, about 400 people have come here, bringing the two-month total to about 2,000, most of them Nicaraguans. Officials expect about 100,000 more to make their way to this heavily Hispanic city during the next 18 months. A delegation of community leaders visited southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Friday to warn those awaiting transportation to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` They need to know that they're going to have to fend for themselves,'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON>, and assistant county manager from <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> recalled an earlier meeting he had in the Nicaraguan capital of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. `` He's ruining your country,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said of the Sandinista leader, `` and I pledge full support for the Contras.'' His call was met by cheers in Spanish to the effect of `` long live democracy'' and `` communism out.'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> told the refugees he plans to speak with President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the refugees. He already had contacted Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to help coordinate federal efforts, he said. Huge piles of used clothing were gathered under a palm tree outside the stadium, and a church group was distributing free orange drinks and chili dogs to those in the shelter _ as well as to dozens more camping outside the stadium who arrived after authorities declared the shelter full. One refugee who arrived too late to get a cot under the bleachers was <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lezama </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The lawyer said he has slept at a friend's house since his arrival. `` I do n't have a family here in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' he said, `` so I'm just waiting here hoping for some place to live and some work.'' The refugees at the baseball stadium will be relocated to <PERSON> Beckham </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a county facility, before Jan. 25, when the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> baseball team arrives for spring training, officials said. `` We have something arranged with the county -LRB- for those accommodations -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said.

 She was a dedicated doctor who had gone to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on her day off to work on a pathology lecture. He was a former <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> mental patient who moved unchallenged through its halls in a lab coat and stethoscope. She was bright, bubbly and caring, a 33-year-old <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native who came north to pursue her medical career and was expecting her first child. He was a 23-year-old from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> who once yearned for a career in baseball but had instead a history of petty crimes and psychiatric problems. The paths of <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinnant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> crossed when he stopped by the tiny office where she was working. During a violent struggle, police say, he beat, strangled and raped her, then stole her fur coat and credit cards. In a city where there were more than 1,840 homicides last year _ an average of more than five a day _ this one got attention. And it raised questions, both about security at the hospital and about the treatment of the mentally ill. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who has a history of psychiatric care since 1981, sometimes stayed at a homeless shelter; sometimes he slept on a cot hidden in a closet on the 22nd floor of the hospital, a massive, 1,200-bed facility Last summer, he reportedly tried to have himself committed to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>'s emergency psychiatric ward but was referred to a clinic. Just last month, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was hospitalized for nine days after telling doctors there he had swallowed rat poison in a suicide attempt. And on Jan. 1, six days before the slaying, a security guard arrested <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> at the hospital and accused him of stealing a clock and a hypodermic needle. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was charged with a misdemeanor, allowing him to go free. `` It's a rotten system set up by our society,'' Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, director of pathology at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hinnant </PERSON>'s boss, said after speaking at a memorial service for her. The mentally ill homeless `` are not in and of themselves at fault,'' he said. `` It's the system that is at fault. They do n't have to be out on the streets, but we have a society that lets that happen, and that's wrong. <PERSON> Hinnant </PERSON> was working on her own time Saturday, Jan. 7, in a fourth-floor office, preparing a lecture for her younger colleagues on Monday. She was to meet her husband, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a piano salesman, that evening. The couple had married in October; she was five months' pregnant But sometime Saturday afternoon, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, wearing physician's clothing and a stethoscope, attacked her, police said He has contended that a man he identified only as <PERSON> John </PERSON> also participated in the attack, but police have found no evidence that <PERSON> John </PERSON> exists. When <PERSON> Hinnant </PERSON> failed to meet her husband, a worried <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> called her office, the police and two hospitals. On Sunday morning, he went to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> where he and a hospital administrator found his wife's severely beaten body Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> called it a `` brutal, outrageous murder,'' and police made the case their top priority. A $ 30,000 reward was posted. Police got a break when three homeless men went to police with some of the doctor's belongings they said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had given to them. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was arrested at a homeless shelter and charged with murder. Last year in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 65,000 people showed up at city hospitals asking for psychiatric help. About 16,000 were admitted for psychiatric care, said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, vice president for mental hygiene at the city's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> and other city hospitals. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would n't discuss whether <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> officials bungled <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s case but conceded that overcrowding can affect a physician's judgment `` I'm not necessarily saying crowdedness interferes with a diagnosis,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said. `` But if you are under pressure, because you have many patients to be seen in a crowded situation, obviously your ability to perform an evaluation is going to be affected by it.'' `` We try to provide the best care we can with the resources we have,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, spokesman for the Coalition for the Homeless, estimated that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has 10,000 homeless people who are also mentally ill. `` The real story is that mentally ill people are routinely turned away from psychiatric hospitals for lack of beds,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said `` That plays a big role in the horrors of street life in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. And these horrors are going to continue until there are more psychiatric beds.'' <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said he hopes something good comes of his colleague's death `` She was an incredibly bright, happy person, and I'm not just saying that. Anybody who knew her knows what I'm talking about,'' he said. `` Maybe something will change because of her.''

<HEAD>Vietnamese Official Arrives In Beijing in Secret Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Vietnamese official arrived unannounced in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Saturday for what is believed to be the first high-level talks since 1979 between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict. Both sides attempted to keep the visit secret, and officials refused comment on the arrival. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which arms guerrillas fighting Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, previously said it would not begin talks unless <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> moves to end its 10-year-old occupation. However, foreign reporters peeking through a window at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s old airport saw Chinese and Vietnamese officials greet a man resembling Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nho </PERSON> <PERSON> Liem </PERSON> The man ducked into a <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> car, which sped away. The Vietnamese ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON> <PERSON> Phuong </PERSON>, came out the front door of the airport and followed in another car. <PERSON> Liem </PERSON>'s name was also on the flight log of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> Flight No. 974, which flew out of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Saturday. Japanese journalists reported seeing <PERSON> Liem </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> airport. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs earlier reserved a VIP room at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> International Airport for a Vietnamese guest but canceled it on short notice, an airport employee said on condition of anonymity. In a possible attempt to keep the visit secret, Chinese officials switched the welcoming venue to the old airport, which shares runways with the newer one. Earlier this week, a top <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance official said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, at the request of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, agreed to its first high-level talks with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> since late 1979. The deal also involved the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> opening direct talks with <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, said Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>, his son and representative in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. He spoke over resistance radio and the text was obtained Thursday. Thai officials also said they knew of the agreement but would give no details. The Vietnamese visit follows negotiations in August between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict, a major stumbling block for improving long-strained ties between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Relations between the two communist giants have been undergoing a thaw in recent months. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will come to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> next month to pave the way for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years. Ties between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, allies during the Vietnam War, deteriorated when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> toppled the pro-Chinese <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> fought a border war early the next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since 1975 in a reign of terror that left at least 1 million people dead. The group is now one of three major groups fighting the Vietnam-backed government of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now arms the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and other rebels there. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> backs the two non-communist groups. In recent weeks, better Chinese-Vietnam relations began to seem possible.

 The government on Saturday acknowledged that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documents link some West German companies to an alleged chemical warfare plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, but said there still was no proof West German laws were broken. West German experts returned home from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after examining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documents on the Libyan plant last week. Government spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> information `` indicates a number of German firms as well as companies from several nations made deliveries for the Libyan chemical plant,'' but officials found no evidence to warrant prosecution. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> contends it has proof that the new Libyan plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> is a chemical weapons factory. <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> maintains the plant manufactures pharmaceuticals. `` A preliminary evaluation of the documents provided by the Americans shows that the material is nothing beyond what we already know about so far and would not stand up in court,'' <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said in a statement. He did not identify the firms named in the documents. Government officials previously said even with indications of involvement in the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> plant, proof would still be needed that West German companies broke their country's export laws. West German authorities have launched investigations into two companies that allegedly were involved in the Libyan project: Imhausen-Chemie of <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON> and the now-defunct I.B.I. Engineering of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said Saturday that after examining confiscated I.B.I. company documents, authorities have not yet found hard evidence the company broke any laws. West German officials at first cleared the two companies but later said they `` can not exclude'' that German companies may have been involved in the Libyan project. Alleged participation by German firms in the Libyan plant has embarrassed the government and resulted in strained ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. When the accusations first came to light through American newspapers, German leaders complained about a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` media campaign'' against their country. The news magazine <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday reported that West German officials began receiving intelligence information about German complicity in the plant in 1986, and not last fall as government authorities have maintained. The magazine said `` several times the -LRB- West German -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ` urgently' and ` concretely' pointed to participation by German firms. `` The federal government did not take reports by the German and American secret services seriously,'' said <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, which did not identify its sources. But <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said the government followed up on all information supplied to it by its intelligence forces without delay. A leading federal lawmaker for the Free Democrats, junior partners in Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s coalition government, on Saturday called for a parliamentary investigation into the government's handling of the Libyan chemical plant affair. `` The scandal is growing every day' and `` damages the image of the Federal Republic,'' <PERSON> Hildegart </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamm-Bruecher </PERSON> told <PERSON> Saarlandischer </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundfunk </PERSON> radio in an interview. <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> also said the magazine has information that West German engineers are assisting <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in improving and rebuilding military aircraft. The magazine said the engineers worked for CTTL of <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION>, a sister company of the Bavarian firm <ORGANIZATION> Intec </ORGANIZATION>.

 A major manufacturer of helicopters said it is looking into building a commuter helicopter that could carry up to 100 passengers. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>, based here, said they have been actively studying the feasibility of such a helicopter, which they call a <ORGANIZATION> VLCT </ORGANIZATION> for `` very large civil transport,'' for the past year. Such a jumbo helicopter could offer a solution to the problem of highway traffic jams and airport congestion, Sikorsky officials said. `` The effort began in earnest last year as a continuation of research of the past 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, director of commercial marketing, in remarks prepared for release Sunday at a helicopter trade show in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` We are producing military helicopters today that can easily transport 20,000 pounds at good speeds over long stage lengths,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` That could equate to 100 passengers and lots of reserves, if that should turn out to be the optimum.'' Using existing technology, such a helicopter could be introduced by the turn of the century, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. Sikorsky officials envision a helicopter that would carry 75 to 100 people on short - to medium-range trips at about 150 mph <PERSON> Sikorsky </PERSON> said it is does not intend to introduce such a craft before the year 2000, to allow time for refinements of equipment and for cities and states to construct suitable heliports.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, getting in a last round of fishing before becoming president, regaled reporters Saturday with his account of landing a 13-pound fighting bonefish the day before. He said he even got a photograph. The fishing `` really is excellent, just wonderful,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters watching his party depart from a private dock before 8 a.m. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> caught no bonefish Saturday although he pulled in 25 smaller fish. He came back after nearly 10 hours on the water saying windy conditions had hampered the fishing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> caught seven different types of fish _ ladyfish, snapper, <PERSON> jack </PERSON>, perch, trout, catfish and a two-foot shark _ and all were thrown back. Perhaps the most interesting catch of the day was by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> buddy <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeder </PERSON>, the former ambassador to <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>, who snagged a seagull as he was trying to cast his line. The gull bobbed around like a kite but soon was reeled in, unsnagged and flew off. The president-elect said work, including preparation of his speech for Friday's inaugural, could wait until he returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Sunday. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> announced several appointments, including <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> as under secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> for international Affairs, and <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> as <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary. When a tourist perched on an adjacent pier told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> she was from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, he asked puckishly, `` Think -LRB- Prime Minister -RRB- <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> would like a little of this bonefishing action?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, fishing off a 17-foot skiff in shallow waters, said he reeled in a 13-pound bonefish Friday after it stripped off 150 yards of line. After weighing it, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he threw the fish back in. `` We got a picture, word of honor,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, producing the roll of film and instructing an aide to `` release it if it looks good.'' The vice president, on his third fishing or hunting trip since his election, said, `` These are, pound for pound, I'd say, as fighting a fish as there is in the world. `` It really is amazing what they do,'' continued <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Then you take them in, weigh them and hold them in the water and stroke them so that they can escape without some shark getting them. It really is very wonderful.'' `` Senator <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> caught a good-sized redfish ... about 10 or 12 or 13 pounds also,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, the Republican senator from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, added a few embellishments. `` You ca n't keep up with him. We had fish all over the place. I caught a redfish. He caught a bonefish. My redfish was one of the largest ever caught in these particular waters,'' said <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rolled his eyes. `` I did n't point out I have to put up with this all day long out there,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used an 8-pound test line to reel in his catch Friday, which he called the `` sporting'' thing to do. `` There's no machine reeling them in,'' he said. This is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fifth trip since 1980 to this resort halfway down the Keys, but he deflated local boosters' hopes Friday when he said he will not establish a winter White House here or anyplace else. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was also fishing with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but no work was on the agenda. Asked if he would steal some time to work on the inaugural speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Tomorrow night I start. I've already started, but not here. When I get back we'll get to seriousness on that.'' <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> has been an assistant <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary since 1984. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> is now press secretary to Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, R-Wash. Three other <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> jobs were announced: <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holiday </PERSON> for general counsel, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallara </PERSON>, assistant secretary for international affairs, and <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLoughlin </PERSON>, assistant secretary for policy development Holiday and <PERSON> Dallara </PERSON> are now <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> McLoughlin </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Purolator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive, was <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s chief of staff as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> in 1982. The transition office also said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> will remain Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, as expected. Another aide, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> will be the first lady's social secretary and a former aide, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, her director of projects.

<HEAD>Textile Workers Threaten Strike Over Pay Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workers at two textile factories in central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> threatened to go on strike Monday if management fails to meet demands for higher pay, a regional Solidarity leader said Saturday. Local Solidarity committees support the wage demands. But the strike call has upset the Solidarity regional executive committee that backs union leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s position that it is now time to focus on reviving the banned union. `` We are not happy with those strikes. It looks like a provocation or perhaps a safety valve that releases some pressure from the boiling pot,'' said <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostrzewa </PERSON> of the executive committee for the <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION> region where the factories are located. The threat of further strikes comes on the eve of a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> plenum scheduled to begin Monday. A government source insisting on anonymity has said communist leaders are prepared to offer to legalize Solidarity if the union agrees to respect a law limiting wildcat strikes, enter into talks and help the government draft political reforms. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Saturday he could not confirm the report that communist leaders are preparing to offer to legalize Solidarity, but he called such recognition `` simply the obvious solution. `` The needs of society are so obvious and there are so many important problems,'' he said. Solidarity was outlawed in 1982 following imposition of martial law in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and has been struggling for legalization ever since. In recent months, there have been clear signs of increasing tolerance of the union and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, with the government hoping to win the help of the opposition as it attempts to revitalize the economy and reform the political system. Solidarity officials say workers at the Emfor factory in <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>, about 82 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, are demanding a pay raise of 32 cents an hour. In nearby <LOCATION> Pabianice </LOCATION>, workers at the Technical Fabrics Factory want raises to compensate for losses of up to $ 10 a month workers say resulted from new wage regulations introduced in the factory four months ago, the union said. Lodz, the center of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s textile industry and one of the country's most polluted cities, was the scene of reported work stoppages Wednesday and Thursday when workers at <LOCATION> Morfeo </LOCATION> factory outside the city demanded a pay raise of 50 percent. Management offered a pay increase of 20 percent Friday, but the strike did not continue, <PERSON> Kostrzewa </PERSON> said. The workers also called on management to improve working conditions and legalize Solidarity in their list of 11 demands. In another development, an opposition spokeswoman said police used batons and dogs Friday to break up a demonstration of about 300 people demanding the legalization of Solidarity in the southwestern city <LOCATION> Walbrzych </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>, a spokeswoman connected to both Solidarity and the banned <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, said about 50 people were arrested.

 Two pilots of a Salvadoran airliner were arrested Saturday for allegedly trying to smuggle eight guns to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in their luggage, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs official. The guns were found in suitcases being taken out of a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> terminal by two <ORGANIZATION> Taca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants during a 12:30 a.m. search of the flight's luggage, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, who heads the local customs office The bags held seven automatic handguns and a 12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun nicknamed the `` street-sweeper,'' <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> said. The Boeing 737 was detained but the passengers were able to leave aboard another flight, said <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>. The plane's captain, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerez </PERSON>, 30, and the co-pilot, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Panameno </PERSON>, 29, both of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, were arrested for investigation of violating the Neutrality Act and scheduled for arraignment Tuesday. The act forbids the exportation of firearms without <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approval. Investigators had not determined for what purpose the guns were intended, <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> said. The airliner was held at the airport while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities considered whether to seize it. But the airline was cooperating and did not appear to be connected to the alleged smuggling, said <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>. `` We're not at liberty to make any comment about it,'' said a man at <ORGANIZATION> Taca </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office who did not identify himself and referred calls to a regional manager in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. A reservations agent there said the regional office was closed until Sunday morning. The search for the guns was prompted by a tip received by agents on Friday that the flight crew would attempt to smuggle firearms, <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> said. Agents conducted an intense search of baggage and people but could not locate the pilots' bags, he said. A short time later an agent spotted two <ORGANIZATION> Taca </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants leaving the terminal with bags with the pilots' names on them. The flight attendants said they had been instructed by the pilot to take the suitcases to his hotel, and agents believe they did not know what they held, <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> said.

 Dozens of Midwestern skinheads converged here Saturday for a weekend of meetings, marches and partying, all with the goal of fighting the racism and violence espoused by rival skinhead groups. `` We want to unite all the anti-racist skinheads,'' said <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baldies </ORGANIZATION>, an intense 18-year-old who has `` SKINHEAD'' tattooed across the back of his shorn head. `` We're here to talk about what real skinheads are all about,'' he said. `` We do n't want the racist people to use the skinhead image as a recruiting tool.'' Youths from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, most in the skinhead uniform of shaved heads, tattoos, boots and flight jackets, traveled to <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> over the weekend, meeting on street corners and fast food restaurants in the city's <LOCATION> Uptown </LOCATION> section. The talk was of music, old friendships and their fight against the racist skinheads in their areas. `` We're trying to organize so people know that being a skinhead is not about hating people,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauer </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Brew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skins </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> group that formed to counter a group of racist skinheads in that city. <PERSON> Lauer </PERSON> was among some 100 skinheads attending a strategy session at a local library Saturday. There were plans for a Sunday march with other groups and a concert featuring local skinhead bands Sunday night. At Saturday's meeting, skinheads from eight cities told of their `` crews,'' or groups, and their fight against white power skinheads in their area. `` There's only one kind of skinhead, and there's bald Nazis,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>, a skinhead from <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The group agreed to form a network to trade information and to offer assistance to individual groups in various locations who are fighting racist skinheads, the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have to work together to make them -LRB- the racist skinheads -RRB- disappear,'' said <PERSON> Corky </PERSON>, a black skinhead from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The past year has been filled with headlines of the violent, racist and anti-Semitic actions of some skinhead groups around the country. An Ethiopian immigrant was killed in November by skinheads wielding baseball bats in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. Synagogues have been desecrated in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Skinheads were involved in a televised melee with blacks on the <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> show. These skinheads spout a philosophy of white separatism and fascism. They talk of creating a white nation, wear Nazi swastikas and complain of a government controlled by `` Zionists.'' But in many cities they are opposed, often in street brawls, by other skinheads who say their racist activities are a perversion of the original philosophies of the skinhead movement, started by English working class youth who listened to Ska, a racially mixed music, and whose ranks included blacks. `` Being a skinhead means being hard working, being for yourself, having a pride in your country and pride in yourself. It does n't matter what your color is,'' said <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Simbura </PERSON>, an 18-year-old member of the Baldies whose cramped apartment served as a rallying place for the skinheads attending the weekend activities The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith claims there may be as many as 2,000 racist skinheads in 21 states, and a check in several cities shows at least as many anti-racist skinheads. But an accurate estimate is difficult because skinheads often move from city to city. Skinheads pride themselves in being violent in support of their ideas and their friendships. The Baldies, whose 40 to 50 members include blacks, Hispanics and Orientals, have warred with the White Knights, a smaller group of local racist skinheads. `` We are violent,'' <PERSON> Simbura </PERSON> said proudly. `` We believe in direct action.''

 Bombs exploded 45 minutes apart in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> on Saturday night, injuring at least two soldiers and two civilians, police said. In the first attack, a soldier and two civilians were hurt when a bomb exploded near <LOCATION> Dunmisk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in a residential section of Roman Catholic west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said. One woman was treated for shock at a hospital and released, and a man and the soldier were receiving treatment but their injuries also were not believed to be serious, said the police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. The area was cordoned off after the explosion just before 11 p.m. -LRB- 6 p.m. EST -RRB-, which occurred while an army patrol was in the area, he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> basketball coach <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> walked off the court at game time Saturday night, protesting a toughened <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> rule on scholarships, with the help of a standing ovation from fans. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s dramatic gesture came just before the tipoff of Saturday night's Big East men's basketball game between his seventh-ranked <ORGANIZATION> Hoyas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. As he headed for the dressing room, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> did not openly acknowledge the cheering crowd at Capital Centre. He went to his car and drove away without speaking to reporters. Assistant coach <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> took over, and the game continued. The move was to protest a new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> rule that will impose harsher academic requirements for incoming freshmen to qualify for athletic scholarships. After being defeated Tuesday, the proposal passed Wednesday by a 163-154 vote at the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> convention in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Without being specific, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said Friday that his boycott would continue `` until I am satisfied that something has been done.'' He called the new rule `` a tremendous tragedy'' because of its potential effect on the ability of poor youths to get a college education. Proposal 42, which is to go into effect next year, would prevent high school students who meet only part of the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>'s entrance standards from being eligible for an athletic scholarship their first year in college. It applies to athletes who fail to get both a `` C'' average in 11 key subjects in high school and a minimum score on one of two standardized college entrance tests: either a 700 out of a possible 1,600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or a 15 out of 36 on the American College Test. A previous rule allowed those who met either of the two standards to get a scholarship, though they could n't play on a team as freshmen. Figures released in 1987 put the nationwide average SAT score at 906 and the average ACT score at 18.7. Critics have charged that the tests are biased abainst minorities, who tend to score lower than whites. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who is black, purposely refused to label the proposal as racist, but did call it `` discriminatory.'' `` I'm beginning to feel that a kid with a low socio-economic background has been invited to dinner, had dessert and is now being asked to leave,'' he said. Temple basketball coach <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, one of many college coaches who expressed support for <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, said, `` Instead of considering some of these proposals, they plan to punish the youngsters, punish these kids who come from a poor background and have a poor educational opportunity.'' But <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Cawood </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> assistant executive director, said in a statement that those who voted for the rule considered it `` a means to strengthen the academic entrance requirements for freshmen,'' not a racial issue. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> is one of the country's top college basketball coaches. He was coach of the 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> men's basketball team, which won the bronze medal, and in 1984 his <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> team won the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> championship. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> coach <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> applauded <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s action, saying his lofty stature among coaches helps make it a very effective demonstration. `` I do n't think that just saying anything gets it done,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. `` In his position, by doing what he's doing, he will draw more attention to it. He feels something needs to be done right now.''

 Dozens of rescuers fought against time and managed to free 31 gray whales that were beached near the southern tip of the <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> peninsula, officials said Saturday. Tourists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and other countries teamed up with college students, fishermen and <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> navy personnel to free the whales late Friday from the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Blas </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, an official with the federal <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The whales ran aground Friday morning in the knee-deep waters of the bay `` after a change in the currents caused by winds caused them to lose their direction,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said. Students from the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baja </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sur </ORGANIZATION>, joined by the other rescuers `` pulled with their arms and used small boats to nudge and free the whales,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paz </ORGANIZATION> newspaper La Extra. `` It was a beautiful thing, a wonderful effort,'' <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON> said. `` The whales went back to deeper waters in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and it appears they're out of danger,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said. Those that beached themselves Friday measured between 10 and 30 feet long and weighed an average four tons, the Excelsior news agency reported. The gray whales migrate to the same lagoons off <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast each year from their feeding grounds off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> The lagoons become mammoth nurseries for the gray whales from January to March each year.

 Scarlet-robed holy men arrived on magnificent chariots and plunged into the confluence of three rivers on Saturday, the beginning of a mystical celebration of a rare planetary alignment. Chanting hymns, the first bathers on Saturday offered milk and flowers as the seven-week holy fair known as `` Kumbh Mela'' began. Millions are expected to take part. `` It is something seen to be believed. It is something nearly impossible for us to understand,'' said <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Dazey </PERSON>, an American tourist who spent $ 1,500 to come from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to this central Indian city to see the fair. `` You ca n't see anything similar to this anywhere in the world, it is worth the money and time,'' said <PERSON> Dazey </PERSON>, a lecturer of religious studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 30 million to 40 million people are expected to bathe at the confluence of the <PERSON> Ganga </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jamuna </PERSON> and mythical <PERSON> Saraswati </PERSON> rivers during the fair, which takes its name from a fight between gods and demons over a pot of nectar. Drops of nectar are believed to have fallen at the confluence, and Hindus believe a bath at the spot will give them salvation from what they consider a long cycle of birth and rebirth. `` Kumbh'' in Hindi means pot and `` Mela'' means fair. The most auspicious time to seek salvation, according to the Hindu faith, is when <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> is in Taurus and the sun and moon are in <LOCATION> Capricorn </LOCATION>, a configuration that occurs every 12 years. The day did not begin on a auspicious note for a group of 50 pilgrims who fell into the river <PERSON> Ganga </PERSON> when the two boats they were in capsized. There were no casualties, an official said. Holy men dressed in saffron, scarlet, white and gold robes were given precedence at the bathing site. They arrived on magnificent chariots pulled by followers, and on elephants and camels adorned with feathers, bells, ornaments and marigold garlands. Brass bands playing popular music marched in front of the procession as the holy men blessed the throngs of people waiting to take a dip. Some of the holy men wore loincloths and others had only ash smeared over their bodies. They bathed in temperatures as low as 43 degrees, with their hair either shorn off or tied in knots over their heads. The Nagas, holy men who live as naked recluses, were given even greater precedence and bathed at dawn. The logistics of the holding the fair almost defy comprehension. At least 11,000 police officers are constantly on duty to monitor the 3,000-acre fair area, according to <PERSON> Jagannath </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwivedi </PERSON>, the chief administrator of the event. The police regulate the movements of bathers and attempt to ease tensions between rival sects of holy men, who have been known to use their spears and lances against each other. `` There is always tension and you never know when a minor clash will snowball into a battle,'' <PERSON> Dwivedi </PERSON> said. Naval divers patrol the river front to prevent pilgrims from drowning. Special attempts are made to keep pilgrims moving steadily to avoid stampedes, he said. At least 800 pilgrims died at the fair held in 1954, and 50 were trampled to death in 1986 at a similar fair in the city of <LOCATION> Hardwar </LOCATION>, upstream on the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hardwar </LOCATION> and the cities of <LOCATION> Ujjain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nasik </LOCATION> are other places in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> where Hindus believe drops of heavenly nectar had fallen, but the Allahabad fair is considered the best. Arrangements to park 200,000 vehicles and 5,000 boats have been made and authorities have run 400 special trains to bring pilgrims to the city, <PERSON> Dwivedi </PERSON> said. Sprawling canvas tents have been erected to accommodate the millions of pilgrims who will participate in the fair. About 13,000 gallons of milk, 10 tons of butter and 5 tons of cheese will be supplied to the pilgrims daily. Authorities have stocked 10,000 tons of wheat, 4,000 tons of rice and 2,000 tons of sugar for distribution, <PERSON> Dwivedi </PERSON> said. Consumption of meat and liquor is banned at pilgrimage centers during Hindu festivals.

 Anti-abortion demonstrators chained themselves to fences, stopped traffic and sang hymns as they blocked the entrances of clinics in three cities Saturday. More than 800 people were arrested, police said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, members of the anti-abortion group <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> continued to defy a federal judge's order to stop blocking clinic entrances. Police said 690 people were arrested at demonstrations at six sites. Demonstrators chained themselves together to slow police efforts as long `` as we possibly can to save as many babies as we can,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuvala </PERSON>, an Operation Rescue spokesman. About 72 of the 400 demonstrators blocking the doors of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> were arrested on charges of obstructing a public place, police said. In <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, about 80 people were arrested in a demonstration outside the clinic of Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgentaler </PERSON>, who led the fight for legalized abortion in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. As activists geared up for the anniversary next weekend of the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion, about 300 people braved freezing rain in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> to attend a rally that did not involve blocking clinics or being subject to arrest. `` Our conviction about human dignity tells us that there is somethng in every human person tht is sacred, that is inviolable, that is not ours to dispose of as we see fit,'' Roman Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> told the crowd Saturday. In the second day of demonstrations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, protesters chanted, lay down, triggered fire alarms and halted elevators, said <PERSON> InspectorRichard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayronne </PERSON>, a police spokesman. Some 500 to 600 people stopped traffic for more than two hours while protesting activities of Planned Parenthood's <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> <PERSON> Center </PERSON>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a police spokesman. About 225 demonstrators were arrested. `` They were lying down and praying in seated positions,'' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. `` Most of the people had to be carried. We would load some people onto the bus, then other people would run out into the street and lie in front of the wheels of the bus.'' About 20 to 30 pro-choice activists demonstrated nearby without incident, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. Later Saturday evening, about 100 pro-choice activists demonstrated outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patrick </LOCATION>'s Cathedral, protesting what they called Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s support for Operation Rescue. `` We understand that he is in political, religious and philosophical agreement with the anti-choice people,'' said <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Choice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the counter-protest and was one of the groups that sought the judge's order. `` But we question whether he approves of their terrorist tactics,'' she said. `` They are now blatantly defying a federal order.'' The second biggest protest occurred at <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, where police said 175 people were arrested _ most of them carried away on stretchers after they refused to walk. Seven people chained themselves together. They used extra-strong steel locks, `` but we have equipment that cuts through them like butter,'' said police Inspector <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayronne </PERSON>. On Friday, 275 members of the group were arrested in two protests outside the <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> clinic, police said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> issued a permanent injunction against the group on Tuesday, forbidding members to obstruct access to clinics that perform abortions in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The order calls for a fine of $ 25,000 a day for violations. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coombs </PERSON>, deputy executive director of Planned Parenthood, said the organization planned to seek a contempt charge against Operation Rescue. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, protesters sang hymns and carried wooden crosses while waiting to be arrested for blocking the entrance of an abortion clinic. `` We got here at 6:30 this morning. We shut the place down. No ladies have had abortions today. Look at the lives we've saved,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquize </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, executive director of Planned Parenthood, disagreed. `` They're not preventing abortions. They're just delaying them and hurting women who already have had to go through a great deal to make this decision,'' she said. Police cleared a path for about a dozen women, some of whom cried and covered their faces, and their companions to enter the clinic as protesters screamed and chanted.

<HEAD>Labor Productivity Boosts Economy But Growth Still Lagging</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Increases in labor productivity and a cut in the number of production workers boosted the Soviet national income by 4.4 percent in 1988, but the economy still fell short of its growth target, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. In a separate report, the official news agency said Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called for major changes in the farm sector, but defended the current system of giant collective and state farms. In a report on a meeting Saturday of the Council of Ministers, or Soviet Cabinet, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said officials revealed some 1988 economic statistics. The national income, a measure of economic activity that differs from gross national product by excluding some indexes, including the value of some services, increased by 4.4 percent in 1988 and by 3.6 percent for the period of 1986-1988, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The growth of national income was assured by an increase in labor productivity with a reduction in 1987-1988 of the number of people engaged in material production,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. However, it said the national income still fell short of the plan for 1988 by 13.3 billion rubles, or $ 21 billion. It did not give the planned figure. The ministers sharply criticized the country's inability to supply the population with enough fruit, vegetables and other foodstuffs. `` No stability in the development of agricultural production and in the operation of processing branches had been achieved so far,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` The population's requirements for many foodstuffs are not met, big purchases of food abroad have to be made.'' The cost of those purchases for the last three years was $ 48 billion, it said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said a long-awaited plenary meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agriculture </ORGANIZATION> will take place in March. The Soviet president is pushing to increase farmers' interest in their work by organizing them on the basis of smaller groups and giving them more responsibility and a chance to earn more money for harder work. But in remarks Friday to agricultural specialists, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> defended the giant collective and state farms that were organized during Stalinist times. The remarks were carried Saturday by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those who do not trust the collective and state farms ... have simply failed to think everything over to the end and failed to sort things out,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying. `` It is precisely now that our big collective and state farms will be able to work in the right way and in the interests of rural workers, and it means, for the benefit of the country because we reveal their potential in boosting the output of products.''

 More than 300 pounds of a powerful plastic explosive that had been stolen from a mine was seized in a raid by agents who posed as would-be buyers for the material, authorities said. Five people were arrested in the raid on a motel Friday night where agents had rented rooms to arrange the bogus purchase, authorities said. There was enough explosive, known as C-3 or <ORGANIZATION> Tovex </ORGANIZATION>, to blow up a three-block area, said police in this community of 50,000 about 45 miles north of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Following the arrests, authorities went to the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION> home of one of the suspects, where they seized armor-piercing rifle rounds, thousands of rounds of ammunition, an AK-47 rifle, hollow-point revolver rounds and homemade bullets designed to pierce bullet-proof vests worn by police, police said. Agents also confiscated a number of handguns; switchblade knives; military flak jackets; a scope-mounted AR-15, described as a civilian version of the military M-16 rifle; 2,000 blasting caps; and a large amount of detonation cord. Books and magazines about terrorism and survival tactics also were found, said <LOCATION> Longmont </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schussler </PERSON> refused to comment Saturday on the group's possible motive. <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunphy </PERSON> said there had been no hint from any of the investigators that suspected terrorists were involved. <PERSON> Dunphy </PERSON> said the investigation had been suspended for the weekend and the five suspects remained in the county jail. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>, which participated in the monthlong undercover investigation along with the sheriff's department, is in charge of the case, <PERSON> Dunphy </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> agents could not be reached for comment Saturday. `` We're real pleased with how this thing went down,'' Sheriff <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said. He identified those arrested for investigation of possession and sale of explosives as: <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobert </PERSON>, 29, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, 51, and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, 29, all of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Moschetti </PERSON>, 18, of <PERSON> Laporte </PERSON>. It was at <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>'s rented home in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION> that officers found the cache of weapons and ammunition. Authorities stalked out the motel after an undercover agent completed a deal to buy more than 300 pounds of the powerful explosive for $ 10,000 cash. The explosives were stolen from a mine in Left Hand Canyon northwest of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> in September, <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said. `` This is a lot of explosives to be floating around,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said. `` To get over 300-plus pounds of this stuff off the street is a good thing.'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said the investigation began when local and federal authorities received information about suspects in the mine theft. Negotiations were conducted with <PERSON> Kobert </PERSON> to buy large amounts of explosives, complete with blasting caps and detonation cord. All five suspects were being held in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The government on Saturday offered one of its major hotels, the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> Sheraton, for sale to the private sector. State-run newspapers carried an advertisement offering the 307-room hotel to a private company with at least $ 150 million in capital. The hotel is wholly owned by the government and run by the international Sheraton chain. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in September abolished the state tourism authority and decided to sell all of its assets, including five major hotels in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The move to sell tourist facilities is a part of President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s drive to develop the private sector in what has been a staunch socialist economy. Selling state assets is seen as a means of overcoming massive government debts and stimulating the economy battered by the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that ended with a cease-fire in August. The Sheraton chain runs another hotel in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s southern port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> that was badly damaged by Iranian shelling. Sheraton officials said they have no idea whether it was also up for sale, but they confirmed the government has announced it would be on the market soon.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> plans to put a huge telescope in orbit and to set up a biotechnology laboratory with an American chemical company, Soviet scientists said Saturday. <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Shemiakin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bioorganic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemistry </ORGANIZATION>, said he plans to sign an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, to establish a biotechnology laboratory in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> is a member of a delegation of high-ranking Soviet researchers attending the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Research at the biotechnology laboratory would focus on nervous system biology, growth hormones to boost livestock production and help underdeveloped humans, and genetic engineering to make crops resist pests, salt and drought, <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> said. Soviet scientists also hope to place an optical telescope with a 10-meter mirror in orbit by about the year 2000, although the proposal does n't yet have government approval, said <PERSON> Nikolay </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kardashev </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviet telescope would be far larger than the $ 1.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> Hubble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION>, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to launch from a space shuttle in February 1990. It has a mirror diameter of 2.4 meters, or about 94.5 inches. <PERSON> Kardashev </PERSON> also said that despite some earlier problems, his country's <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 2 space probe, launched last year toward an encounter with the <LOCATION> Martian </LOCATION> moon Phobos, seems to be working well as it heads toward the red planet. `` We hope it's OK _ no problems,'' he said. The Soviets earlier lost all contact with a similar probe, <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 1. This is the second year a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation has visited the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> AAAS </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes the journal Science and bills itself as the leading general scientific group in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Some 10,000 scientists are expected at the meeting, which concludes Thursday. The Soviet scientists cited numerous examples of U.S.-Soviet scientific cooperation in each of their fields, and expressed hope for more. `` It's very good improving international cooperation,'' <PERSON> Kardashev </PERSON> said. Soviet scientists also want to boost cooperation with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> earthquake experts, especially in fault-ridden <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, following the devastating quake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, who headed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation. <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, also said it was unlikely the death toll from the earthquake exceeded 30,000. `` Nobody knows now absolutely perfectly how many'' died in the Dec. 7 earthquake, but `` 25,000 or 30,000 may be so,'' <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> said. For weeks after the 6.9-magnitude quake in northwest <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, Soviet officials estimated the death toll at 55,000. Late last month they downgraded it to about 25,000 after nearly that many bodies were recovered from collapsed buildings. However, American engineers returning from an <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> visit said Jan. 4 said thousands of bodies never will be found and said they thought probably 60,000 died during the quake. `` Sixty-thousand _ this is too much,' <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, often speaking through an interpreter, called the Armenian quakes `` a very sad and difficult situation,'' and said the Soviets want to learn how to speed post-disaster rescue and relief efforts, protect against earthquake damage, better predict temblors, and improve building methods. <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, citing the Soviets' interest in cooperative biotechnology research, said the joint Soviet-Monsanto lab would be located at his institute and that <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> would help equip it. Members of both organizations would be on a board overseeing the lab, he added. Details have n't been worked out about how profits would be shared from any products developed at the lab, but `` patents should be joint patents,'' he added.

 A barge slammed into a concrete pillar supporting the center of the three-mile <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> on Saturday, knocking the pillar into the water and halting vehicle and marine traffic, officials said. The four-lane bridge was clear of traffic at the time and no injuries were reported. The bridge is the only direct link between <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> and suburban Gulf Breeze and is used daily by thousands of commuters. The only other land access is a detour of about 60 miles. The bridge will remain closed to all boat and vehicular traffic for three weeks while the southbound lanes are stabilized, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazucha </PERSON>, regional maintenance engineer for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. Two-lane traffic then will be permitted in the northbound lanes while permanent repairs are made, which will take from four to six months, <PERSON> Hazucha </PERSON> said. Construction workers building an emergency lane on the bridge `` saw the situation coming and cleared the site so there were no cars actually traveling over that spot,'' said Gulf Breeze City Manager <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>. `` Fortunately, obviously, there were no vehicles that went into the water.'' Officials said it was not immediately known why the barge was unable to navigate away from the pillar. <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> Boling </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Esther </PERSON>, said he was fishing on the end of the Gulf Breeze pier next to the bridge Saturday morning when the barge hit about 100 feet away. `` I just stood here and watched him take out the end of the bridge,'' <PERSON> Boling </PERSON> said. `` They scared the fish away.'' Initial reports indicated the southbound side of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 98 bridge was sagging about five feet, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. A 32-foot <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrol boat was on the scene, and a bridge inspection team from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> was assigned to assess the damage, he said. The barge was operated by <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and was empty of cargo at the time, officials said. The bridge is part of the main coastal highway in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. It has been undergoing a multimillion-dollar expansion to add emergency lanes on each side.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said Saturday that it attacked two intruding Pakistani helicopters and an armored column that committed an `` unprecedented act of aggression,'' the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted official Afghan news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> as saying the helicopters were carrying `` leaders of extremist organizations, foreign military advisers and high-ranking <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> officers to the area'' when they landed at a farm in <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> province on Monday. Soviet and Afghan media often refer to the U.S.-backed, anti-government guerrillas as `` extremists.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Pakistani mechanized column reached the same area on the same day, `` bringing armed people, arms and ammunition.'' The Soviet-backed Afghan military attacked, damaging or destroying the two helicopters and some armored cars, it said. The report, quoting the Afghan military command, did not give any casualty figures. There was no immediate word from the Pakistani government or Afghan guerrillas based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` The Pakistani armed forces committed an unprecedented action of aggression against the republics of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted the Afghan military command as saying. `` <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>'s actions not only flagrantly violate the letter and spirit of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements, but also enter into direct contradiction with the universally recognized norms of international relations,'' it said. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> made a formal protest to Pakistani diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Anti-Marxist resistance fighters who oppose <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s pro-Soviet government operate out of bases inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and near the border. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> repeatedly have accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violating the April 14 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement by continuing to supply the resistance with weapons. Under the agreement, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is to withdraw its 100,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. Half of the soldiers were withdrawn between May 15 and Aug. 15, but Soviet diplomats have said they might not meet the final deadline because of continued interference by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In another development, guerrilla leader <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> said his alliance plans to announce a provisional government within a month, the Saudi Arabian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Okaz </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>, spokesman for a coalition of seven Pakistan-based Afghan guerrilla groups, said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Okaz </ORGANIZATION> that his group would not object to the return of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s deposed king, <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>. The former monarch has lived in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> since his overthrow in 1973. The guerrillas are demanding power be turned over to them exclusively after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdraws its remaining troops. But the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 in support of a Marxist regime, insists President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government should stay on after the military withdrawal.

 The artistic and musical director of the new Opera of the Bastille has been fired in a dispute over duties and salary, and a stage director said Saturday he will refuse to direct the opera's debut presentation. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON>, a conductor and concert pianist, was ousted Friday after contending an agreement he signed with the former conservative government of <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> guaranteed his position and a salary of more than $ 1 million.

The May 5 accord said <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> should receive a salary of between $ 1.1 million and $ 1.2 million. <PERSON> Berge </PERSON>, appointed in August, offered <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> a $ 570,000 salary as musical director. <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> 1 radio he considered the development a `` breach of contract'' and threatened to sue. <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> said allowing <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> to be artistic and musical director was giving him too much power. `` It is a little bizarre and that does n't exist in practically any country of the world,'' <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> said. Several artistic personalities, including stage director <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Chereau </PERSON>, composer <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulez </PERSON> and singer <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, signed a message to President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and Minister of Culture <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, saying they would not be involved in the programs <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> planned unless his duties were restored. <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON>'s firing may throw in to question the opening date of the Bastille Opera, set for early next year.

 A labor chief famed for his <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> gambling exploits faces an inquiry into the source of his wealth as part of the crackdown on the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, government sources said Saturday. Former Sen. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> already has been charged with possession of illegal weapons. <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, the union's secretary-general until last week, declared his innocence on the weapons charges early Saturday from a bed at the <ORGANIZATION> Cardiological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> He checked into the hospital complaining of heart trouble last week after federal officials raided the fortress-like home of his mentor and the union's top leader, <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>. Authorities also raided <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, confiscating several high-caliber weapons, ammunition and silencers. A search of his $ 75,000, bulletproof limousine turned up more than $ 1 million in jewelry, cash and bars of silver. The jewelry included a gold bracelet that authorities said weighed almost half a pound and several gold medals from gambling tournaments. The Excelsior news service said <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> declared assets of less than $ 100,000 six years ago when he began his recently completed term in the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> was the last of the 51 suspects to enter a plea in the crackdown on the <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Administrative judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> on Saturday ruled that 28 of those arrested on arms charges were eligible to post bail. No top union leaders or <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quina </LOCATION> associates were included in the ruling. Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have indicated more arrests are expected. The sources also said there will be an investigation into <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>'s `` unexplained riches.'' The former senator was an enthusiastic patron of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> casinos. He once reportedly gambled away more than $ 1 million in a matter of minutes. His extravagance at the gaming tables was documented in books and articles several years ago by the late journalist <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>. The union crackdown began Tuesday with a spectacular raid by police and soldiers on <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madero </LOCATION> on the Gulf Coast. A federal agent died in the shootout. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> and other union officials face a variety of charges, including illegal arms possession, murder and tax evasion. Judicial officials said Saturday that <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>'s condition is stable and they expect him to join <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> and other union leaders in prison next week

 A former farm worker was sentenced to 40 years in prison by a judge who called him `` the general, admiral, chief'' of a multimillion-dollar heroin and cocaine ring. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON> <PERSON> Aragon </PERSON>, 34, a Mexican national who lived in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> at the time of his arrest last year, was sentenced Friday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>. The sentence was the second-longest prison term in a federal drug case in the state. <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez-Vaca </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Spanaway </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Maximino </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia-Caballos </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Woodbrook </LOCATION>, also were sentenced by <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> to four years in prison for their part in the drug conspiracy. They were among 17 people, besides <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON>, who have pleaded guilty or been convicted of drug-related offenses in the case. <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Rosanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON>, was sentenced to six months in jail for taking telephone messages for him in the smuggling operation. His brother is one of two defendants who remain fugitives in the case. `` You were the general, admiral, chief _ at least in this area,'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON> was named in 42 counts of a 130-count federal indictment, including a charge of running a continuing criminal enterprise. Four days into his trial in November, he pleaded guilty to reduced charges in exchange for a promise by government lawyers not to recommend more than 40 years in prison. The charges he pleaded guilty to included possession with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin, possession with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine, conspiracy to distribute heroin and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The law allows no parole, and even with good behavior he must serve at least 34 years behind bars. <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON> was described as a hard worker in the tomato and pepper fields of an impoverished area of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> as a boy and later in the apple orchards of north-central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the tree farms around <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Diskin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON> began his drug ring in December 1986 and expanded it until last May, when he and the others were arrested by federal agents after a nine-month investigation.

 Rural interstate highway accidents killed 352 more people than a year earlier in states where the speed limit was raised to 65 mph, while death tolls on other roads decreased slightly, according to a government report.

Congress authorized the increased limit beginning April 2, 1987, and 38 states have adopted it for their rural interstates. Highway deaths in those states on urban interstates and other roads where the 55 mph limit remained totaled 21,366 for the same period in 1986 and 21,231 in 1987, the report said. Fatalities in states that raised the speed limit increased by an average nearly three times as high as in 10 states that kept the limit at 55 on all roads, the report showed.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> trembled as he delivered his first inaugural address. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was thrown off his stride by a spectator falling from a tree. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was 29 minutes late taking the oath of office. Now it's <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s turn. From the 13-star flags to the metal detectors, everything is just about ready for Friday's repetition of the ceremony <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> called `` a day of national consecration.'' The inauguration of an American president has, in its 200-year history, been marked by eloquent prose, adorned by poetry, buried under a blizzard, pelted with rain and on two occasions visited by such harsh weather that participants had to move indoors. It has seen reunions of <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s Rough Riders, of the battery that Cpl. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> led in World War I and of the P-T boat crew that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> commanded in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The metal detectors are a new touch in keeping with the terrorist-conscious <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of 1989, but security is nothing new to inaugurals. When <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> took the oath in 1861, `` two riflemen lurked at each window of the Capitol wings flanking the inaugural stand, watching for any interference,'' wrote biographer <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandburg </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> assumed office in the depth of the Depression in 1933, there were machine guns at the Capitol. Both <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> were in the stovepipe hat era of inaugural dress, which prevailed until 1952, when <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> opted for homburgs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> returned to the high silk hat tradition, but more recent presidents have usually worn business suits. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wore morning clothes, with striped pants and tails, for his first inaugural in 1981. The weather also has varied. It rained on <ORGANIZATION> FDR </ORGANIZATION>'s inaugurals in 1933 and 1937, as well as on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s second one in 1865. In 1909, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was in the grip of a blizzard, so <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> took the oath in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Chamber instead of outside as usual. In 1961, it was 28 degrees at noon, but the ceremonies went on at the East Front of the Capitol as scheduled. That was when poet <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, blinded by the sunlight reflected from fallen snow, was unable to read the especially written poem he had brought with him, and summoned up from memory an old one, `` The Gift Outright'' _ `` Such as we were, we gave ourselves outright ... To the land vaguely realizing westward ...'' In 1985, with the temperatures in the dangerously cold range, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> canceled all outdoor activities for his second inaugural. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Bicentennial of the Constitution, which is also observing the bicentennial of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s first inauguration, says the best account of it was given by an observer named <PERSON> Willam </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclay </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Maclay </PERSON>, the father of his country `` trembled, and several times could scarce make out to read'' as he delivered his address to a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. By <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s second inauguration, after the capital had moved to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, he was advised by his Cabinet to hold a simple ceremony in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber and travel to it `` without form, attended by such gentlemen as he choose.'' He chose to ride alone, in his carriage. At <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s inauguration in 1861, according to an observer quoted in <PERSON> Sandburg </PERSON>'s biography, `` at one point in his speech, Mr. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was thrown completely off his balance for a moment by a crash not far in front of him, followed by something which for an instant looked like a struggle ... a spectator falling out of a tree.'' As for <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, he wrote in his memoirs that the pre-inauguration gathering in the Capitol Rotunda took so long that the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> did n't strike up `` Hail to the Chief'' until 12:14 p.m., and it was n't until 12:29 that he actually took the oath. It did n't matter. He had been president since noon anyway. The Constitution provides that the old president's term ends and the new president's term begins then, not with the speaking of the oath.

<HEAD>New Twists in Insider Trading Scandal, Stay Tuned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The prosecutor quit for a possible mayoral bid, his aides botched the first key case to reach trial, and the biggest corporate target of their fraud probe offered a top job to a former government adversary. No, it was n't the latest episode of `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.'' But the twists in the Wall Street insider trading scandal this past week could well provide some real-life fodder for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> writers of the glitzy television series. It began last Tuesday when politically ambitious <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, architect of a massive securities-fraud crackdown over the past few years, announced he was resigning at the end of the month. Although <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s departure was expected _ because of numerous dropped hints he might run for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mayor _ it came at a particularly crucial time in the Wall Street investigation for which he is largely responsible. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> will be leaving more than a half-dozen important cases unresolved, along with increasing acrimony over what defense lawyers call his brutal and sometimes careless tactics. Coincidentally, those tactics backfired on his assistants just as <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> was calling the press together at his downtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office to say farewell. Next door in federal court, a judge decreed a mistrial in the stock-manipulation case against <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a senior company official, the first key prosecution to reach the trial phase in the scandal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said prosecutors broke the rules by failing to inform the defense that a key piece of evidence they introduced may have been altered. A federal appeals court sided with her in ordering a new trial, but warned the <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> aide handling the case: `` Do n't withhold any more evidence.'' The departure of <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> also signaled his evident failure to extract a plea bargain agreement from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield bond financier, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who has continued to assert his innocence although his employer capitulated last month <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest corporate target of <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s crusade, agreed Dec. 21 to plead guilty to six unspecified felonies, pay a record $ 650 million in fines and restitution, settle related litigation with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and cooperate in the government's expanding fraud probes. As part of a move to cleanse its sullied image, the firm announced last Thursday it had offered the chairman's job to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> chief who authorized the investigation that ensnared <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> in the first place. It was n't clear by the end of the week whether the offer would be accepted by <PERSON> Shad </PERSON>, who is now <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. But he was quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> as saying any decision was subject to `` favorable resolution'' of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s legal problems. In other business and economic news this past week: _ Government statistics suggested sharp rises in consumer spending, debt and inflation The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said consumer borrowing swelled at an 8.2 percent annual rate in November, driven by credit-card purchases; the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said retail spending shot up 6.7 percent last year, the fastest growth in four years; and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wholesale prices rose 4 percent last year, the highest rate since the early 1980s. _ Although the stock market appeared to be holding its own, the post-crash uncertainty of the securities world was dramatically demonstrated by sharply different earnings situations at two of Wall Street's biggest firms <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> reported the highest quarterly profits in history, while <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it would suffer a quarterly loss, partly because of the tumbling value of its holdings in a troubled <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bank, <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>. _ President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested he might propose tax changes that would make debt-financed takeovers less attractive, but there was no evident slowdown in the merger news that colored 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Cooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell their cable TV operations in transactions totaling almost $ 2 billion; and <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported sharply lower profits partly because of efforts to fight a $ 1.4 billion hostile takeover bid. _ Meanwhile on the cooked and and raw poultry fronts, a judge ruled <PERSON> Popeye </PERSON>'s Famous Fried Chicken may resume a $ 290 million takeover attempt of rival Church's Fried Chicken; and <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> set Wednesday as the deadline for suitors <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to submit new offers in a $ 1 billion bidding struggle

 Throughout the country, aging bridges crack or sway as traffic clogs pot-hole-ridden roads and highways. Public dams and sewers cry out for more than a good plumbing job.

You've got to get to work,'' said forum participant <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenen </PERSON>, managing director for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm very bullish on volume.'' An MBIA survey of municipal bond professionals predicted that volume of tax-exempt municipal bonds _ most often used to finance infrastructure and other public projects _ will rise 7 percent in 1989 to a record level $ 120 billion. Volume for the taxable municipal market should reach $ 2.8 billion this year, compared with an estimated $ 2.2 billion in 1988, it said. The survey suggested the biggest increase would come in bond issues for transportation, estimating a 61 percent rise in volume over last year to $ 14.08 billion. However, the biggest chunk of newly issued bonds, an estimated $ 30.04 billion this year vs. $ 28.38 billion in 1988, will be used to refund old debt, the survey said. It predicted a 58 percent rise for gas and electric to $ 12.14 billion; a 48 percent rise for water and sewer projects to $ 12.67 billion; a 35 percent rise for hospitals to $ 14.94 billion; a 26 percent rise for education to $ 20.31 billion; and just a fractional rise in housing to $ 13.96 billion. In last year's general election alone voters nationwide approved a record $ 13.8 billion in state and local bond issues to finance projects ranging from road and bridge repairs to new prison facilities. Experts say the anticipated increase in bond volume is largely due to a steady reduction of federal assistance and the historical neglect of public works projects by some local and state governments. `` Until very recently ... the need to replenish and expand public works has been largely ignored,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, senior director of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, noted in a separate report on infrastructure needs and financing released at the forum. `` By the early 1980s, the infrastructure was wearing out faster than it was being replaced,'' he said. Last year, one of the nation's busiest bridges _ the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, which links <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> _ was shut down for more than three months after inspectors discovered extensive corrosion. The bridge was built in 1903 for bicycles and horse-drawn buggies. When closed it was carrying more than 100,000 vehicles and 420 trains daily. <PERSON> Koenen </PERSON> noted that just a few weeks ago, the 122-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Roebling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suspension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION>, which spans the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, was closed briefly after it began swaying under heavy pedestrian traffic following the Bengals-Seahawks football game. But officials later declared the bridge safe. Supporting the <ORGANIZATION> MBIA </ORGANIZATION> survey on projected volume, <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>'s study found that capital investment needs are by far the greatest in the areas of highways, streets and bridges. Next to that comes public transit, water supply and distribution, waste water treatment, solid waste disposal and airports. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> also noted that changing population patterns will affect municipal bond issuance. `` If the population trend continues, 62 percent of the population will live in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and West by 2010, compared with 48 percent in the 1970s,'' he said. `` That's going to stimulate spending needs.'' Another factor that could effect future municipal spending is the so-called `` Greenhouse Effect,'' or the pollution-caused warming of the atmosphere, <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. `` Recent studies indicate that global warming, with the resulting rise in water levels due to polar melting, will affect economic activity and infrastructure spending in coastal areas.''

<HEAD>1988 Futures Volume Set New Record; Drought Boosted Ag Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Trading volume on the nation's futures exchanges rose by a modest 7.3 percent last year as a drought-driven surge in agricultural hedging and speculation helped offset a slump in the stock-index futures markets. Volume on the 11 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> futures exchanges totaled a record 295 million contracts, compared with 275 million contracts traded in 1987, according to figures compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group. The increase compares with volume expansion of nearly 25 percent in 1987 and continues a growth pattern of more than two decades. On futures exchanges, people trade contracts for future deliveries of commodities _ such as grain, cattle, gold and crude oil _ and financial instruments, including government securities, stocks and foreign currencies. Commercial players _ those directly involved in producing, buying or selling a particular commodity or financial instrument _ use futures to hedge against losses in their business dealings or financial investments. Speculators are investors who seek to profit from the fluctuating prices of the contracts. Agricultural futures trading in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dates back more than 120 years but financial futures, introduced in the early 1970s, now account for most trades. Last year, financial futures trading accounted for 139.1 million, or nearly 57 percent, of the total futures volume, <ORGANIZATION> FIA </ORGANIZATION> figures show. More than half of those trades involved the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond contract, with a volume of 70.3 million, a 5.2 percent increase over the previous year. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the oldest and largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> futures exchange, also reported a dramatic resurgence in grain and soybean futures trading. Wheat volume soared by 75 percent, soybean trading jumped 69 percent, and corn volume surged 53 percent as the worst drought in 50 years withered crops and sent prices skyrocketing. `` The drought of 1988 added significant increases to volume in agricultural trading,'' said <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON>, the exchange's chairman He said the exchange's more lightly traded agricultural options, hedging instruments that are similar to futures, also `` worked extremely well to manage risk in the agricultural markets.'' Overall volume at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> grew by 12.5 percent in 1988, the 20th consecutive year of record volume for the exchange. With a total of 143.1 million futures and options contracts traded, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the industry was 48.5 percent. The nation's second-largest futures exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, did not fare as well. Officials reported a 7.5 percent decrease in volume, mainly due to a 40 percent drop in stock-index futures trading at the exchange. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trades the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock-index futures contract, by far the industry's leading contract of its type despite the drop in volume. Officials blamed the decline on slack interest in stock market investing following the crash of October 1987. But the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> also reported a 6.6 percent increase in foreign currency futures trading, including a 6.3 percent gain in its Eurodollar futures contract _ the exchange's volume leader _ and a 20 percent leap in yen futures Overall volume at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> last year totaled 78 million contracts, giving the exchange a 26.4 percent share of the industry. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, home of crude-oil and platinum futures, scored a 33.5 percent volume increase with 34.3 million contracts traded. The volume placed the exchange third in the industry with an 11.6 percent share. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which specializes in gold, silver and copper, saw its volume shrink by 10 percent to 19.2 million for a 6.5 percent share of the industry. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> traded a record 10 million contracts, up from 6.3 million in 1988, for a 3.4 percent share. Trading volume at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> MidAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> reached a record 3.4 million contracts, a 44 gain over 1987, giving the exchange a 1.2 percent share of the industry. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> reported a record turnover of 3.1 million cotton, orange-juice and financial futures contracts, a 19 percent gain, for a 1 percent share of the industry. The remaining 1.4 percent of the industry volume was divided among the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. These figures do not include statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which trades only financial options.

<HEAD>Stocks Defy Rising Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 These are uneasy times for stock market investors who key their strategies to the ups and downs of interest rates. For the past several weeks, interest rates have been rising, especially in the short-term money markets. That's supposed to spell trouble for stocks, by acting as a drag on the economy and by luring investors' money away from the stock market and into interest-bearing securities such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills. But things have n't worked out that way of late. The stock market has rallied since mid-November, recently reaching a series of new highs since the October 1987 crash. A lot of money managers at investing institutions who have been shying away from stocks are now faced with the possibility that a train might be leaving the station without them. A substantial corps of skeptics on Wall Street remains unimpressed by the market's recent strength. Some of these observers say it is merely a temporary manifestation of the `` January effect,'' a much-documented tendency of stock prices to rise in the early stages of a new year. In simplest terms, the January effect is believed to arise from several seasonal factors _ including the cessation of yearend selling for tax purposes, and infusions of new money into pension plans. If this is the only driving force for the market's advance, the rally is presumably in for a limited run. A good many analysts, however, contend that the rise in stock prices is also the product of an abundance of fear and pessimism that still persists. Market rallies typically begin in periods of gloom, and end when all the doubters have been converted to optimistic views and expended all their reserve buying power. `` Conservative attitudes of individuals, 10 percent cash reserves in mutual funds and similar high cash positions of pension accounts are the best sources of support for the stock market,'' said <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalasani </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Prescott </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> continues to be a place of value for foreign investors. Those dynamics will support the stock market as long as earnings hold up.'' In the past week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 31.78 to 2,226.07. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index gained 1.62 to 159.58; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market climbed 2.35 to 387.09, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 4.53 at 315.93. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 153.57 million shares a day, against 153.39 million in the first week of 1989. Analysts who take a bullish view say there is another possible explanation for the recent gains in stock prices. It could be, they suggest, that interest rates will soon stop rising and turn downward. `` The so-called upward pressure on interest rates may prove to be illusory,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> LeFevre </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Utility stocks, highly sensitive to changes in interest-rate expectations, have lately traded well above their low points of last year, he points out The behavior of the Dow Jones utility average `` says interest rates are headed lower, not higher'' in the intermediate to long-term future, <PERSON> LeFevre </PERSON> maintains. Talk has even begun to stir on the Street of an increasingly powerful rise in stock and bond prices should the economy slow and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> relax its recent credit-tightening. `` When that occurs, all will know that short rates are due to peak and the proper place for assets is in long bonds and stocks,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We could see a scramble develop sometime soon.''

 Indications that world oil production is declining helped strengthen some crude oil prices this week. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said Friday the cartel's output for January could fall below the 18.5 million barrel-a-day target. In addition, ongoing problems in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> have reduced oil production by about 500,000 barrels a day. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, rose 31 cents to close at $ 18.48 a barrel Friday after advancing 3 cents on Thursday. The contract traded as high as $ 18.64 but retreated on profit-taking, analysts said. Other contract months were mixed. However, traders noted that prices of crude contracts between June and November fell. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s accord took effect Jan. 1 and extends for six months. Many economists speculate that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will raise its volume in the second half of the year. WTI was trading in the $ 15 range when members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> agreed in November to cut back production to 18.5 million barrels. Traders say prices have risen amid signs <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is abiding by the agreement and new speculation on Friday encouraged further buying. `` A statement from Subroto that January production would be below the quota was probably the main factor moving the market,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline futures rose. The February contract for gasoline closed 0.70 cent higher at 49.97 cents a gallon. Heating oil futures ended the day mixed, with the February contract up 0.11 cent at 52.95 cents a gallon. The March contract also rose, but subsequent months declined. Heating oil prices have not firmed along with other energy prices recently as demand has fallen off due to seasonal factors, traders said.
