 A 24-year-old man has pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the death of his two children, who died last summer hours after he locked them inside his car. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> of <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> entered the plea Monday, and faces a maximum 10-year prison term and $ 20,000 fine. Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Searer </PERSON> deferred sentencing pending an investigation by probation officials. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> testified at his wife's trial two weeks ago that he agreed to watch their children, <PERSON> Kristle </PERSON>, 3, and <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON>, 1, on the morning of Aug. 22, but instead locked them in the car and closed the windows. The children were discovered in the afternoon, when the temperature reached the mid-80s, authorities said. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> pleaded guilty to reduced charges and also is awaiting sentencing. Both parents were charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter and endangering the welfare of children. The more severe counts against Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> were dropped. The two endangerment counts were incorporated in Shields' guilty plea, court officials said.

 What <PERSON> Shim </PERSON> <PERSON> Min-sop </PERSON> is doing now conceivably could have landed him in jail not so long ago. He's drawing cartoons that poke gentle fun at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> political leaders And people are getting a laugh out of them, without worrying that something could happen to them as well. <PERSON> Shim </PERSON>'s cartoons seem tame by most standards. Politicians and political parties are parodied as rival baseball teams and the jibes are never too strong. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Shim </PERSON> says, it is a remarkable change. `` In the past it was a taboo to caricature the big political names in this country,'' he said. Ridiculing the president or making jokes about him, for example, were seen as anti-state acts. <PERSON> Shim </PERSON> and other cartoonists have been able to take advantage of recent political liberalization in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to start injecting a little laughter and ridicule into politics. The cartoonists contend that political caricature is healthy and Korean politics can benefit from it. `` Cartoons and caricatures will bring the political leaders closer to the people,'' <PERSON> Shim </PERSON> maintained. Political cartoons have proliferated in newspapers and magazines and command large, enthusiastic audiences eager for a regular flow of material ranging from traditional editorial cartoons to long stories. Literacy is very high in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> but people prize cartoons for their humor. Newspaper cartoons so far are low-key and ironic. Some recent ones showed caricatures of the main political parties chasing each other in an unending circle, to symbolize ineffectiveness. Another showed top leaders as squabbling babies. A favorite of cartoonists is to have bemused Koreans staring at politicians battling for power and asking what is happening to the country. `` It is refreshing to see the taboos broken about the myths surrounding the political bigwigs,'' said <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Kye-su </PERSON>, a political analyst who has followed the growth of political cartooning. Many cartoonists say they have always seen their work as a way of calling for reform and liberalization. `` Korean cartoonists have been struggling for political change for a long time,'' <PERSON> Shim </PERSON> said. Cartoons are a valuable teaching tool that can vividly explain the meaning of an issue as well as amuse readers, <PERSON> Shim </PERSON> added. `` The political cartoonist can present the issues in a more amusing, but understandable manner to the public.'' The newly installed President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who pledged freedom of speech and expression after years of authoritarian rule, personally encouraged cartoonists to take up political subjects by saying he did not mind being caricatured. <PERSON> Shim </PERSON> and other cartoonists say their work is still very gentle and restrained for fear of angering authorities and losing what freedom they have. But they say they expect to make their humor more biting as time goes on and liberalization expands. Cartoonists are also restrained by fear of offending a politician's supporters, <PERSON> Shim </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s factional politics stress loyalty and supporters tend to resent any joke at their leader's expense, he said. `` The reaction can be terrible from the supporters,'' <PERSON> Shim </PERSON> said. `` People should learn to accept both positive and negative.'' Anti-government students and dissident groups, which have long used cartoons in their political literature, also are making greater use of caricatures, but usually not in a humorous way. The cartoons distributed at anti-government rallies and meetings are biting and bitter. Government and mainline opposition politicians are depicted as vicious tyrants suppressing the people with tear gas and clubs. Some are more subtle, depicting the divided opposition leaders as crying infants quarreling over a toy. `` They are not jokes,'' said one dissident. `` They show the people the reality of the government and why there is no democracy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' Anti-government cartoons are distributed in pamphlets on college campuses or posted on trees and sidewalks at anti-government rallies. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, represented by a fiendish-looking Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> or a swaggering and bullying <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier, is a fixture in the underground cartoons. Dissidents claim the country's successive authoritarian governments have survived because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing. One recent cartoon showed a tough-looking Statue of Liberty with a boxing glove on her upraised hand. <PERSON> Shim </PERSON> and other cartoonists reject their underground competition and the radical politics behind it. They say change must be moderate. `` It's too early to expose politicians to a more revealing fashion,'' <PERSON> Shim </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Mayoral elections in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> have left a small crack in the political fortress of the upper class, the power behind this Latin American country since it won independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1819. The elections on Sunday marked the first time that mayors had been elected in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Previously, they were appointed by governors, who were appointed by the president. And the president always came from the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> or the Conservative parties that are manipulated by the rich. But a leftist coalition, the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, won at least 14 of l ,008 mayoral posts in Sunday's election, which in some cases brought people from the poorer classes closer to the seat of power in local politics The money and power of the traditional parties ruled out in most cases, such as in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>, the son of former president <PERSON> Misael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>, was elected mayor on the Conservative ticket. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> President </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virgilio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> won 430 of the mayoral races, and the Conservative party won 402 mayoral posts. Coalition candidates won 24 of the mayoral elections. Other results may not be known for a week because of the remoteness of many towns. The showing by the new Patriotic Union was small. But the results were surprising given that the party was organized just three years ago. The leftist coalition also had to survive a wave of assassinations by right-wing death squads that killed 520 of the members of the party, including its president, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> also had to confront a colonial attitude of patronage. Entire towns and areas traditionally adhere to one of the two traditional parties. Until recently, people did not join political parties. They were born into them. It is common knowledge that failure of a peasant to support the party controlling an area means virtual economic suicide. A loan application at the local bank for buying seed will be rejected. A worker will be turned away when looking for a job at a big hacienda. Colombians still call the rich <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosca </PERSON>, a kind of intertwined pastry. The term refers to a loose intertwining of influential people _ politicians, businessmen, landowners, doctors and lawyers _ who control the lives of the poor. Nowhere are the poor more aware of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosca </LOCATION> than in small towns, where the wealthy own most of the rural land. A 1970 government study showed that 4.3 percent of the people in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> owned 68 percent of the land. Ten percent of the farms held 80 percent of total farmland. Those figures probably have not changed much. The government's concession to hold mayoral elections is an indication that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> may be heading toward true democracy. The country has a long history of violence, perpetuated largely by a political elite that refused to reform partisan traditions. For example, elements of the Liberal party resisted social changes in 1948. A charasmatic Liberal leader, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Elicer </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaitan </PERSON>, broke away from the party and ran as an independent. <PERSON> Gaitan </PERSON> was assassinated shortly afterward. People saw their only hope of bettering their lives cut down, and the frustration exploded into the worst disturbances ever seen in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. That period, known simply as The Violence, has had an impact upon Colombian politics ever since. So when former president <PERSON> Belisario </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> offered peace talks to the country's leftist guerrillas in 1984, most people approved. Perhaps they recognized that the need for social changes were again putting pressure on the system. The guerrillas said in 1985 they wanted a government more responsive to the poor people. For starters, they said they wanted the election of mayors. <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> agreed, and the congress approved a constitutional amendement to allow the first election in 1988. The peace talks collapsed last year, but the government went ahead with the elections. The army says there are about 5,000 leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The rebels claim they have close to 20,000 combatants. Whatever the number, their forces are growing each year. Ten years ago the army said there were only about 2,500 guerrillas. The growth of guerrilla forces and the possibility of another upheaval probably will depend greatly on whether the wealthy will concede to such programs as land reform, housing programs and building more schools and hospitals in rural areas. The government's attitude toward social change continues to be cautious. The election of mayors is a beginning, but not a solution.

<TEXT>
 A Soviet dissident whose pleas for an exit visa were ignored until he stepped up his reporting of human rights abuses has found a new home in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Kizelov </PERSON>, 43, arrived in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> last Tuesday after a journey that led from <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION>, a town in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, through <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Tolstoy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, an international, non-profit organization that helps resettle political refugees, found him an apartment and gave him enough money to live on for a month, said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalpe </PERSON> of the Woonsocket chapter. <PERSON> Kizelov </PERSON>, who had never been outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> before his expulsion, learned English by listening to British radio broadcasts and should have little trouble finding a job, Ms. <PERSON> Dalpe </PERSON> said. `` I will start with any job available,'' said <PERSON> Kizelov </PERSON>, `` even washing dishes in a restaurant.'' <PERSON> Kizelov </PERSON> had been a dissident since the late 1970s, when he wrote what he calls his first `` open letter'' opposing the government _ a statement against the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He sent the letter to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Monitor and <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which published it outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I did n't begin to hide until 1983,'' <PERSON> Kizelov </PERSON> said, because in general, it is safe to risk criticizing the Soviet government without reprisals for three years or so. But the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> patrols that began following him that year did not deter him. To make himself a difficult target, <PERSON> Kizelov </PERSON> began moving from city to city. He held odd jobs, and friends helped with money. Meanwhile, he continued to gather information about Soviet human rights violations, sending the information to groups interested in publishing it. Last fall, <PERSON> Kizelov </PERSON> found himself working as a theater decorator in <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION>, a town whose former political boss, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, had been promoted to serve as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s first secretary of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was drummed out of office by party officials last November after delivering a speech that reportedly rankled powerful officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, including General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Officials in <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION>, however, took a dim view of one of their favorite sons being kicked out of office, and began demonstrating in public. <PERSON> Kizelov </PERSON> wrote about it. He sent his 3,000-word report on the demonstrations and a cover letter to <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, editor of a Moscow-based underground magazine called Glasnost. The sporadically-published magazine takes its cue from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` openness'' in public affairs. But <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> never received the report. <PERSON> Kizelov </PERSON> assumes it was intercepted by Soviet police. A short while after sending it, he received an `` invitation'' to report to the emigration office to talk about his desire to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` They say nothing until I was involved in the demonstrations,'' said <PERSON> Kizelov </PERSON>. While Americans seem to be cautiously optimistic about the policy of glasnost, <PERSON> Kizelov </PERSON> calls it a `` mask.'' He says Soviet society is intolerant of anything but the official line and there is no such thing as freedom of speech. `` I do n't like the socialist way of life in principle,'' said <PERSON> Kizelov </PERSON>. `` In my opinion, it is the wrong way of development.''

 A funeral procession bearing the bodies of three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas slain in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> was met by thousands of people when it arrived early Tuesday under heavy rain at <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Jeering Protestants waving <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> flags had hurled stones and bottles at the cortege in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> as it made its way by road to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> in the Irish Rep0ublic. <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, were unarmed and walking toward the Gibraltar-Spanish border when <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> commandos in civilian clothes shot them March 6. British officials said the three had planned to detonate a car bomb at a public military ceremony in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s fortress colony at the southern tip of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> two days later. Monday night British troops fatally shot a gunman near <LOCATION> Savage </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> home Police identified the slain man as <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, 33. A statement by <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police headquarters said <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> fired at an army patrol and the soldiers shot back. It said <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> was jailed in 1978 for membership in the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and illegal possession of guns. The report said <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> was released on parole in 1985. The coffins of the three slain guerrillas were carried into the homes of their families in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Hundreds of police and soldiers, many in riot gear, were on duty as the funeral procession arrived in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION>, five miles north of the border town of <LOCATION> Carrickaron </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, the hearses with the bodies drove qround the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> town for two hours Monday night and were cheered by crowds of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters. But on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION>, 35 miles south of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, Protestants threw bricks, bottles and stones at the vehicles, breaking some windows. Farther north at <LOCATION> Loughbrickland </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Banbridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> crowds again pelted the cortege with stones and shouted abuse as police moved forward to disperse them. The hearses were escorted by police vehicles and followed by dozens of cars containing <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters. Press Association, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, said about 1,000 people met the coffins Monday when they arrived from <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s airport, many of them members of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political arm. The cortege stopped briefly at the border at <LOCATION> Carrickaron </LOCATION> when two senior officers of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, ordered the Irish tricolors removed from the coffins. Police, relatives of the slain guerrillas and <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> members reached a compromise after a 30-minute argument and the flags were folded up and left atop the coffins, covered with funeral wreaths. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is waging a guerrilla campaign to drive the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. At least 2,628 people have been killed since sectarian violence began in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in August 1969. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and other senior party figures led the airport reception. The coffins were draped in the green, orange and white Irish flag and a priest recited prayers in Irish and English. Four women in black jackets and trousers formed an honor guard. A lone bagpiper played a lament. In the heavy mist, the coffins were transferred to three hearses. A cortege led by police, which grew to more than 100 cars, made its way along the 100-mile route to the border. About 20 cars continued from the border to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, where the three will be buried Wednesday or Thursday. Thousands of people lined the roads. Scores of teen-agers held black flags at waist level as the convoy passed through the Catholic town of <LOCATION> Drogheda </LOCATION>. Many drivers threw black flags from their car windows. On both sides of the border, black flags hung from lampposts along the route. The procession took three hours to cover the 60 miles to <LOCATION> Dundalk </LOCATION> on the border, where 5,000 people turned out. Another lone piper escorted the hearses through the town. An honor guard of four men and two women dressed in black marched beside them. <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> soldiers loaded the coffins onto the jet in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> because baggage workers would not handle them, British television networks reported. In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said it fired a three-volley rifle salute at a shrine in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> to coincide with the bodies' arrival on Irish soil. An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement circulated by <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> said the guerrillas wished the bereaved families `` peaceful and dignified funerals,'' which was seen as a possible hint that the funerals would be allowed to take place without demonstrations. In the past, funerals have been disrupted by hooded <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members firing salutes over the coffins and the police moving in to arrest them. Police in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and British-ruled <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> were expected to mount a huge security operation to prevent such displays this time. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> said the three guerrillas would be buried at <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on Wednesday or on Thursday, Saint <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s Day Relatives of the dead appealed for calm and a Roman Catholic bishop asked police and mourners to avoid violence. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said it would intervene if necessary to stop armed displays at the funerals.

 Pressure mounted Monday on <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to sign an Afghan settlement aimed at securing the withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops and end nine years of fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Sources close to the talks said the Pakistani chief representative, acting Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, received a message from the Kremlin calling upon him to sign the documents without further delay. The chief Afghan negotiator, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, scheduled a news conference for Tuesday, the day Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> named as a target date for the conclusion of the nearly 6-year-old talks. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will bring home its troops starting May 15 if the settlement is signed Tuesday. Both sides have said they do not consider March 15 a rigid deadline. Sources close to the talks, who declined to be identified, said that apart from pressing for the formation of an interim government, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> also felt that there are still some loose ends to be sorted out in the agreements that make up the peace package. The Soviet deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Loginov </PERSON>, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, on Monday that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is still `` optimistic'' it can pull its troops out, but he acknowledged the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks are encountering difficulties. `` Nobody has set a definite deadline,'' he said. `` All that has been said is that if by the 15th -LRB- of March -RRB-, the last of the four agreements has been signed, then we will begin to withdraw our forces.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has been insisting that the formation of a transitional government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> be linked to the settlement. Both <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have adamantly rejected that condition. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> argues that only a broad-based government can guarantee implementation of the peace accords and the safe return of five million Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` We are ready to sign the moment our concerns are removed,'' <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> told reporters as his delegation left an afternoon meeting with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>. Before an earlier meeting in the morning, <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> had said, without elaborating, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would `` announce something today.'' But there was no such announcement as the talks were adjourned until Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, where he was on a state visit, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was asked by a reporter if there was progress at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks. With a smile, he said, `` There is,'' and `` There will be,'' but did not elaborate. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s pro-Soviet government, accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Monday of using tricks to block the final agreement. `` It can be said candidly that that people who resort to ruses and who do n't want the document of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks to be signed are actually enemies of the refugees,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> was quoted as saying in an interview with the Afghan news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> excerpted by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> once said the only issue between the two countries was an acceptable timetable for Soviet withdrawal. He charged that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> raised questions about an interim government to delay the agreement. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said the rebels are interested in the millions of Afghan refugees only as a `` reserve of military force to be used as cannon fodder.'' <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, meanwhile, was reported to be in constant touch with his capital, <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, where the cabinet held its third lengthy meeting in two days, presumably to weigh its next step. The Swiss Radio reported earlier that Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> had said a decision on whether <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would sign the settlement would be made Monday. In another development, a spokesman for the fragile seven-party alliance of the anti-Soviet guerrillas, revealed that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had rejected again any direct negotiations with the insurgents. The spokesman, <PERSON> Gulbadin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, who also leads the largest and most radical group in the alliance, said that no guerrilla delegation would be sent to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> unless the Soviets drop their opposition. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, the leader of the Hezb-i-islami group, is widely believed to be the next chief of the seven-party alliance following the resignation of <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON> for health reasons. Unconfirmed reports indicated the 69-year-old <LOCATION> Khalis </LOCATION> quit in protest over plans to send a guerrilla delegation to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said his appointment as leader of the alliance may be announced Tuesday. `` But if there is a majority opposing my leadership, then I will not be chosen,'' he added, speaking in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Only a month ago, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> looked ready to wrest the Republican presidential nomination from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Now, he is desperately looking for ways to keep his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hopes from being wiped out by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in today's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary. In mid-February, everything was looking up for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. He had scored an upset win in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, and as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary approached, polls were suggesting he could overtake the vice president in the state. But in one 48-hour stretch _ the final two days before the voting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign derailed, and has never gotten back on track. A combination of body blows _ weak organization, poor planning, a mean image and just bad luck _ has reduced the formidable minority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to a battered, struggling candidate. With the vice president leading 2-to-1 in the Illinois polls, the question <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> faces over and over is when _ not if _ he will withdraw. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said it will not be today or Wednesday: `` I've made a judgment that <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, whatever happens, we're going to keep going.'' From the start, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was judged a tough contender for the 1988 nomination. A seasoned politician with national stature, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator was one Republican who could match <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in fund-raising, name recognition and experience. But there were doubts about <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as well, doubts that all came to the surface the weekend before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary Feb. 16 _ `` the 48 hours that cost them the campaign'' is how one Republican professional described those days. `` He was ready to put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> away,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> pollster <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarrance </PERSON>, who worked for former candidate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was riding the wave out of his big early win _ a triumph in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses on Feb. 8. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a disappointing third behind former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. That should have meant a big boost for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary the next week. `` You need some luck ... and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> did n't get much good luck out of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>,'' Tarrance said. `` The news of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> beating out <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ... was the big story.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> did start picking up strength in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was down, and changing his style as his campaign struggled to recover. But by Thursday of that week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was on the counterattack, readying ads accusing <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of `` straddling'' major issues. And the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign could not get its act together to respond. One television commercial attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ called `` Footsteps'' inside the campaign _ was ready Thursday. But top aides viewed it and judged it `` unusable'' because of poor production and problems with the script, said two sources who spoke on the condition they not be named. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> tried twice that week to make a new spot, promising to veto any tax increases, but once again aides judged it not usable, a top <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> adviser said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. When the new ads were ready late Friday, the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign could n't get them on the air. The television stations were closing for the weekend, making it harder to switch the tapes at the stations. `` They could n't get the old ads off the air and the new ones on,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> professional, who is not working for any campaign. `` That's what the campaign is supposed to be able to do. They did n't.'' Then it was on to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rode President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s popularity and his own solid organization to a wipeout win over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> on Super Tuesday Organizational problems have been a trademark of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaigns from the start. The wily <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> operator was loath to delegate authority and had a penchant for snarling lines of authority, several <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> aides said. Former Labor Secretary <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> was brought into run the campaign on Nov. 1, but that was probably too late. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has been working on strategy for years,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> pro. For example, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign had prepared long and hard for the possibility of an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> loss. In contrast, the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign found itself pumping up expectations of a victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, when even aides said the preferable course would have been to talk of how tough it would be to beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his own backyard. And after the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> loss, the image of a mean <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> came back to haunt him. He snapped at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a television interview that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ads were lying about <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s record. The chaos in the final days of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign was eerily echoed in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> went into the state saying he had to win, then backed off on that contention. He made deep cutbacks in his staff, and let the word leak out before he made an explanation. He abruptly moved to pull ads off the air, giving rise to rumors he was throwing in the towel. To top it all off, his half-hour address to the voters of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on Saturday night was hit by technical problems. `` He did it to himself,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` The voters ca n't see any big differences between them on the issues. What they did is make their decisions on personality and style.'' <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters saw each man face defeat in a key early contest _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamsphire </LOCATION>. And they liked what they saw in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> more.

<HEAD>Israel Imposes Curfew On 600,000 Palestinians In Gaza Strip</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> imposed a nightly curfew on more than 600,000 Arabs in the entire <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and reportedly sealed off entrances to the occupied territory after about 300 Arab policemen in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said they would resign. The army on Monday also closed one of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest fruit and vegetable markets as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> tightened economic sanctions in the occupied lands. Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers on Monday shot and wounded 11 Palestinians, hospital officials said. A 3-year-old girl was shot in the eye with a rubber bullet, and five Israelis were injured by stones thrown by Arabs. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the 300 Arab policemen in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> announced Monday they would resign. They joined 450 officers in the occupied lands who turned in their badges earlier following orders of PLO-inspired underground leaflets. The curfew in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, announced Monday, was a reaction to the resignations, the radio said. The 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. curfew also was designed to prevent `` the entrance of violent instigators ... and of written instigation material,'' it said. The army said the curfew was to prevent late night demonstrations. The curfew over the entire <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was imposed for the first time since Arab unrest started on Dec. 8. It forces the residents to stay in their homes while entrances to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> are sealed off by the army, the radio said. An army spokesman said the curfew would be imposed until further notice. At the <LOCATION> Erez </LOCATION> checkpoint at the entrance to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> on Monday saw 15 to 20 Arab trucks and taxis prevented by the army from entering. He said soldiers would let in army vehicles and cars belonging to Jewish settlers who live in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Other Israelis and journalists were not permitted to drive in. `` Where would we sleep? We want to enter, all our families are inside,'' an Arab worker stopped at <ORGANIZATION> Erez </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. The situation in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s refugee camps was not immediately clear. On Sunday night, the army cut electricity and telephone lines to 41,000 people in the Beach Camp, an Arab reporter said. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities acknowledged that some policemen in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> quit but gave no figures. About 850 Arab policemen work in the occupied territories. The police control crime and direct traffic, but they are not used to quell <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> rioting in the occupied lands. `` It is clear their resignations were not handed in freely but because they fear for their lives,'' <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> police commander <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Graffiti on the walls in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> called for the resignation of the Israeli-appointed mayor and city council, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said. In response to the PLO-backed unrest, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stepped up economic sanctions. Shipment of gasoline and other fuel to service stations in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was banned as of Sunday, and a regional fruit and vegetable market was closed on Monday in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Arab merchants said 70 trucks carrying produce were turned away Monday. In addition, the army ordered <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> shop owners to close during the morning hours when <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaflets said shops should be open. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said the Arab merchants responded with a total commercial strike. The economic test of wills continued on Monday in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where slogans painted in the red, green, white and black colors of the outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag called for a two-day general strike starting today. Protests were reported on Monday in <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> and the nearby <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Yamoun </LOCATION>, where troops using live ammunition shot and wounded 11 people, hospital officials said. According to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> figures, at least 91 Palestinians have been killed since anti-Israeli rioting began Dec. 8. Witnesses said Jewish settlers on Monday drove through the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amari </LOCATION> refugee camp, honking their horns. Witnesses said Palestinians then held a similar car demonstration, during which soldiers shot 3-year-old <PERSON> Rasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Yussef </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> in the eye with a rubber bullet.

<HEAD>New ATV Settlement Stresses Advertising, Safety Programs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Advertising for all-terrain vehicles will begin stressing safety under a new agreement that also calls on makers of the off-road vehicles to set up new training programs and limit ATV sales. The government on Monday disclosed the new settlement, which could replace a preliminary agreement announced in December. The recreational vehicles have grown sharply in popularity in recent years, with more than 2 million currently believed to be in use. At the same time accidents have increased markedly, with more than 900 fatalities reported in the last five years, as well as 300,000 injuries, according to information collected by the Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. That led to a government safety investigation and the new agreement by the commission, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and the five manufacturers of the machines: <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kawasaki </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Polaris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> will hold a hearing on the settlement April 18 and could order it into effect immediately. It would replace the preliminary agreement between the government and the manufacturers announced on Dec. 30. <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> said through a spokesman that the settlement is the biggest safety accomplishment in the history of his agency. Commission general counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said the settlement will continue the ban on sales of new three-wheeled ATVs and that manufacturers have agreed to buy back any of the three-wheel versions remaining in dealer inventories. The more stable four-wheel ATVs will still be sold, he said, but marketing of the full-size versions with engines of 90 cubic centimeters and over will be limited to riders aged 16 and over. Smaller machines will be allowed to be sold for riders ages 12 to 16, he said. The commission vote was 2-1, with <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> and commissioner <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> in favor and commissioner <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> dissenting. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who also voted against the preliminary settlement in December, said in a statement that the settlement should have allowed <ORGANIZATION> ATV </ORGANIZATION> owners to obtain refunds. `` Without the refund, consumers are not obtaining the remedies necessary given the nature and severity of the hazards presented by ATVs,'' she said. The new 150-page settlement is much more detailed than the one announced in December, which drew criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and consumer groups as not being extensive enough. Some consumer groups have said all the vehicles should be recalled because of safety problems. <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said the settlement calls for the manufacturers to spend between $ 8.4 million and $ 8.6 million on advertising starting in the fall. The ads will stress the inherent safety risks of the vehicles, <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said, and will be placed in a variety of media. Included, he said, would be advertising on such broadcasts as the World Series, CBS Evening News and Monday Night Football. In addition the manufacturers have agreed to set up a national headquarters to develop safety and training programs for riders, and to provide hands-on training for all new purchasers and for all consumers who bought the machines since Dec. 30, 1986. Buyers will be offered incentives such as $ 50 in cash, a $ 100 savings bond or merchandise certificates to induce them to take the training programs, <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said. Other provisions of the agreement, he said, include: _ New warning labels on the machines being sold, plus mailings providing these labels for all current owners for whom the manufacturers have addresses _ The hands-on training programs for new buyers will include their immediate families also _ Development of new owners manuals with added safety information _ Establishment of a safety hotline for consumers to get information and development of safety-related videos to be made available at dealer showrooms _ Elimination of the safety verification form that had been required as part of the earlier settlement This form, in which a buyer acknowledges knowing of the hazards of the machines, had been criticized by consumer groups, who said it could be used to protect the manufacturers in case of lawsuits stemming from accidents.

<HEAD>Doctors Should Rule Out Look-Alike Diseases in Mysterious Fatigue
Syndrome</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors should rule out a long list of ills, such as AIDS and alcoholism, before they decide patients are afflicted with a baffling, newly recognized ailment called chronic fatigue syndrome, researchers say. In the past, the illness has been referred to as the yuppie disease, because some of its victims are young professionals, or more formally, Epstein-Barr virus syndrome or chronic mononucleosis. In a report published in the March issue of the Annals of <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, 16 top researchers in this field agreed to call it chronic fatigue syndrome, and settled on a definition for the afflication. The definition largely involves ruling out other illnesses that can cause similar symptoms, including the hallmark of the syndrome, extreme fatigue. `` It's a diagnosis of exclusion, and it has to be considered as such even after you've ruled everything else out,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and chief author of the report. `` You have to continue to be concerned that there is something else going on,'' he added. `` You have to keep an open mind and not simply close the books.'' Another co-author, Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Komaroff </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said the new definition should help researchers as well as doctors who are faced with patients who have heard of the illness and think they have it. `` Many of them have other physical illnesses, or they are depressed or anxious,'' he said. `` Doctors need an anchor to help distinguish patients with chronic fatigue syndrome from patients who have other kinds of fatigue.'' According to the definition, people with the syndrome must have suffered debilitating fatigue for at least six months. It must be bad enough to reduce daily activity by at least half. Doctors also must rule out a long list of diseases that can mimic the symptoms of the syndrome. These include cancer, tuberculosis, AIDS, depression, diabetes, alcoholism, poisoning and kidney disease, among many other disorders. In addition, patients must show signs of at least eight of 11 other possible conditions. These are mild fever, sore throat, painful lymph nodes, generalized muscle weakness, muscle discomfort, headaches, painful joints, sleep problems, sudden onset of the symptoms, such neurological problems as trouble concentrating, confusion or forgetfulness and general fatigue lasting at least 24 hours after exercise that the patient easily could have withstood when healthy. When the disease first received widespread attention three years ago, doctors believed it was somehow linked with the Epstein-Barr virus, because some victims showed signs of activation of that common virus. However, many experts now say that Epstein-Barr virus is not associated with the illness, since victims are just as likely to show exposure to the viruses that cause measles, genital herpes and cold sores, among other things. Although the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> has received thousands of questions about the illness from patients and doctors, no one knows how many people have it. Its cause also is a mystery. Some believe it can be triggered by persistant infections with a variety of viruses. Among the suspects are a group of microbes called the enteroviruses as well as a newly discovered virus known as human herpes virus 6. Researchers suggest it's a reaction to these lingering infections rather than the mischief of the viruses themselves that makes people feel poorly. `` My theory is that certain viruses are able to escape ever being fully eradicated by the body,'' said <PERSON> Komaroff </PERSON>. `` They come back to fight again. You have a constant Iran-Iraq war where the battles are continual. The process of doing battle and mobilizing the body's immune system causes some of the symptoms of feeling ill.'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> noted that the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome are similar to those experienced by people treated with the natural hormone interferon `` Interferon is the body's normal response to a viral infection,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. `` It may be that something like overproduction of interferon for a prolonged period may be causing the illness.''

 The confrontation in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has increasingly become an economic test of wills between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation authorities and Palestinians. Underground Palestinian leaders have persuaded many merchants and ordinary citizens to stop paying taxes and have enforced repeated strikes, keeping at home a large part of the 110,000 laborers who work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The measures are designed to make <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> bear more of the economic burden for occupation, which <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists say will give impetus to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s withdrawal. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has adopted increasingly tough economic sanctions, some of which are designed to put the squeeze on the Arab middle class. The army imposed an indefinite ban on trucks taking gasoline to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s 50 service stations. The move crippled public and private transport. <LOCATION> Qabatiyeh </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of several thousand people, was banned from exporting its quarried rock to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and visitors from abroad will not be allowed to visit the village, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said. The move was punishment for the lynching of an alleged collaborator who was hung from an electricty pole after he fired into a crowd advancing on his home and fatally wounded a child. In <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, the army closed a regional produce market and ordered shops to close during morning hours, when <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaflets said the shops should be open. `` The military government is trying to tell the people here who is boss. They want to hurt the people economically. I think they intend to try to break the strike this way,'' said <PERSON> Saeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Najah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli authorities have selectively used other measures as well, such as cutting off electricity to areas placed under curfew. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say they hope such steps will encourage moderates to put pressure on Palestinian militants, although there is no sign that such measures are having the desired effect. `` Agitators on the Arab side want to disconnect the population as much as possible from any connection with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said a senior official in the military administration of the occupied territories. He said the tax rebellion had minimal impact in January and February, leading to a 10 percent decline in revenues, or about $ 200,000 a month. But he said collections were expected to be far lower in March and that road repairs, garbage collection and other services in the occupied territories could suffer if there was not enough income to fund the $ 239 million budget of the army-run <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. To counter the tax boycott, authorities required Arabs to obtain a certificate saying they paid their taxes before getting import-export licenses, driver's permits and other documents. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also lowered the amount of money Palestinians could bring from abroad without permission from $ 5,000 to $ 1,200. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said more economic sanctions were being considered to quell the revolt, which began Dec. 8. and has resulted in the death of more than 90 Arabs He declined to elaborate. But <PERSON> Arieh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON>, former head of the army-run military government in 1974-76, said it might be necessary to stop Arabs from working in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or using the bridges to trade with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` Violence has peaked, in my opinion, but it will continue and it's doubtful whether it will stop without taking brutal -LRB- economic -RRB- measures,'' <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON>, an economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was better positioned to endure a showdown than the Palestinians. `` The occupied territories are dependent for income on three things: work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the export of agricultural goods and quarried stone to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, and financial support from Arab countries,'' he said in an interview. He said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> job boycotts would deal a `` serious blow'' to the construction industry, textile factories, restaurants and garbage collection. But overall, he said, the `` economic impact on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is much smaller.'' Arab economists disputed the contention. `` We are prepared to suffer more than the Israelis,'' said <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazboun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist. He said the tax rebellion had added to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s cost of continuing the occupation and that bad publicity abroad had affected investment and tourism.

 The new Austrian ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> came bearing gifts to Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, but the mayor greeted him with a diatribe against <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. `` I think he's a bad guy. He was just one of those obsequious guys when he was here, before I knew he was a war criminal. And I had dinner with him a couple of times,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> on Monday told <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hohenfellner </PERSON>, who became the permanent Austrian representative at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in February. `` You'll forgive me if I'm honest, OK, and it's not intended as anything but honesty because I have the highest regard for your chancellor.'' <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who was secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, has come under fire since files were uncovered that suggest he had a greater role than he has admitted as an officer in the Nazi army during World War II. There are reports that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> knew about atrocities being committed against partisans and villagers where he was stationed. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has stood fast against the accusations and refused to resign as president. He has been banned as an undesireable from <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hohenfellner </PERSON> that Austrian Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> was invited to dinner the next time he comes to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I'd like him to stay at <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mansion </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said of the mayor's residence. `` I would n't do that for the president. ... For the president, this city is off limits.'' The mayor gave <PERSON> Hohenfellner </PERSON> a tie and the ambassador gave him a 19th century goblet <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he would use at Passover.

 Former minister <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> has decided not to contest a civil suit accusing him of choking his wife nearly to death, <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s attorney said Monday. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s decision was based on estimates that it would cost nearly $ 100,000 in legal fees to dispute the lawsuit filed Feb. 2 by <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s mother-in-law, <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>. `` He told me that he had decided his assets would be best used in the support and maintenance of his children,'' said <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> before a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury investigating the attack. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, 40, missed a Monday deadline for answering the suit, which seeks unspecified damages, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, an attorney for Mrs. <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>. In absence of a response, a judge could rule against the former senior minister of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> and award damages. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, 39, has been in a coma since she was found unconscious on the floor of her garage last April.

 <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, once on the same team pulling the levers of city government, are on the comeback trail, this time by trying to throw a monkey wrench into each other's plans Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, the former mayor, says her last attempt at office will be today when she runs in the Democratic primary for clerk of the nation's largest local court system. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, a former alderman and former chairman of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, wants the same office. But he's now a Republican running unopposed in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. A victory by either candidate in November's general election could give a jump start to his or her political future. But a loss could be politically fatal. `` It's a position that has some patronage, it has jobs,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON>, a social scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and analyst of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> politics. `` More important than the number of jobs, if you're an office-holder, you can grab the media. As <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> once said, the new precinct captain in this age is television,'' <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON> said Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was in a tough primary race with <PERSON> Aurelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>, the county <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsed candidate and daughter of fiery <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, mayor from 1979 to 1983, was ousted by <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who became the city's first black chief executive and then withstood an election challenge from her last year. Besides announcing proposals to streamline the court system's bureaucracy and broaden services for county residents outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON> have mostly haggled over who had the late mayor's affection <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supported Mrs. <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON> and the party's slate of endorsed candidates just a few days before he died Nov. 23. But in Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s effort to appeal to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s powerful black voting bloc, she points to a unity breakfast she had with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after he won the primary last February. Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> also pulls out a newspaper article that quotes Mrs. <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON> as saying she was n't <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s first choice for the clerk's job. Mrs. <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON> has countered with a radio blitz featuring prominent black politicians and even <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s half brother, <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> believed we had come too far to go back to the days of the bosses. ... That's why <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Aurelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>,'' Price says on the ad, broadcast on black-oriented radio stations. But Mrs. <PERSON> Pucinski </PERSON>'s alderman father was viewed among blacks as an obstructionist during <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s reign as mayor. `` I would expect <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> to get the black vote,'' <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON> said. `` The question is how much.'' <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, an alderman for 15 years, lost power to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and waged an unsuccessful bid against him on a third-party ticket last April. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> subsequently resigned from the chairmanship of the county Democratic organization to become a Republican. With no primary opponent, <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> has spent most of his time talking about demanding integrity and honesty from the court system's 2,000 employees. He's also portraying Democrats as big taxers and spenders, hoping to get conservative Democratic voters to join his cause in November. At a rally Sunday for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> said `` they do n't represent you.'' `` They do n't hardly represent anybody any more,'' he said. If Mrs. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> survives the primary and meets <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> in November, the clerk's race will feature two former allies. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> was her floor leader in the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and she once helped install him as chairman of the county <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Today, the affection is lost. `` He's devious. He's a wheeler-dealer,'' she told a newspaper last week. `` It's distasteful. ... I do n't like him. He's not my cup of tea.''

 Two hundred arrests were reported Monday as anti-nuclear protesters tried to block buses carrying thousands of workers to the nation's nuclear testing grounds. The protesters slowed traffic into the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site, 65 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, but failed to halt work, said <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>. The majority of those arrested were carried away by officers after lying down on the main road leading into the sprawling desert site. Later, many of those arrested had to be dragged by police off buses in <LOCATION> Tonopah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, about 135 miles away, where they were taken to be booked before being released. `` They were n't going to stand for being driven 135 miles away and being let loose,'' said protest spokeswoman <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Nye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said officers decided to remove the protesters from three buses and from the <LOCATION> Tonopah </LOCATION> convention center, which was serving as a booking facility, after they refused for several hours to be released. `` They just sat down and went limp and we dragged them out of there,'' said Capt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbmann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> claimed some of the protesters were injured, but <PERSON> Gumbmann </PERSON> said he knew of no injuries. Monday's arrests followed a demonstration Saturday by up to 5,000 people, the largest in more than seven years of protests at the site. Police arrested 1,240 people that day, mostly on misdemeanor trespass citations. A spokesman for the American Peace Test, which is sponsoring the demonstrations, said 50 protesters had infiltrated the 1,350-square-mile site, which is the size of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> West </PERSON> said he was unaware of any such incidents, but said any infiltrators would not be able to reach sensitive areas.

 The following is a look at the main points of disagreement between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. LAND FOR PEACE <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> opposes giving up any part of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in exchange for peace. Instead, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> calls for the implementation of the 1978 U.S.-mediated Camp David accords signed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The agreement says Palestinians should be granted self-rule on domestic matters while leaving security and foreign affairs to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. After three years of autonomy, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arabs would negotiate a final status for the occupied lands. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> believes handing occupied territories back to the Arabs would endanger <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence by leaving it smaller and more vulnerable. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is ready to enter negotiations with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, from which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which would involve returning parts of the occupied lands. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> says <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would insist on retaining <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and holding on to areas along the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as a `` security border.'' His guiding principle is to hand back as much of the heavily populated Palestinian areas as possible, above all the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, taken from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were occupied during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Today 1.5 million Palestinians live in the occupied territories along with 65,000 Jewish settlers. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is afraid that if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> keeps the territories, it will quickly lose its Jewish majority because of the high <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> birth rate. THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE The international peace conference idea calls for negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> representatives under the aegis of the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rejects the notion outright. He claims four of the five powers side with the Arabs and will have the power to force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to give up the occupied lands. He believes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will side with them on this issue. He also fears the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> will be invited to join the talks. As a concession to international involvement, he has suggested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> invite <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to talks, leaving them to negotiate on their own after a ceremonial meeting of the four delegations. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> believes <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> will negotiate only within an international forum and that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must accept this condition if it wants to talk peace. He says the conference will be only an `` opening'' of direct talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a joint <LOCATION> Jordanian-Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation. He argues the conference will not have the power to impose its will or interfere in direct negotiations and says the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will not attend the talks. THE <PERSON> SHULTZ </PERSON> PLAN The peace initiative by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is an attempt to bridge the gap among moderate Arabs, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. It calls for convening an international conference in April, followed by direct talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation on Palestinian self-rule. In December, even if autonomy negotiations were still going on, the sides would begin talks on a permanent settlement. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> says the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan is `` cumbersome ... and does nothing to guarantee the safety of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' His aides accuse the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of reneging on its commitment to the Camp David agreement. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is against negotiating a permanent settlement while talks on the interim autonomy arrangements are still going on. He says the idea of autonomy was to see whether Israelis and Palestinians could live on a new footing before considering a permanent settlement. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> accepts the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan, warning that it may be the last chance in the forseeble future to make peace with the Arabs. He says talks would be conducted while the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> government is in office. He describes the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as the freindliest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has ever known. THE PLO <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> both refuse to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has left open the possibility of talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if it renounces violence and recognizes the Jewish state. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will have nothing to do with the organization.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> stumped <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> today in hopes the state will demonstrate he can win in the North, while he kept his fingers crossed for `` a stronger result than people now expect'' from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>' Democratic presidential primary. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was traveling to Lansing today where he planned to appear with state legislators backing his candidacy before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Arriving in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Monday night, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> described himself as a `` friend of organized labor'' and invoked the name of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor, who has n't endorsed a candidate `` I'm offering the politics of the future, very much in the way Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> has,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. As he campaigned across <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> earlier Monday, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator contended he was encouraged about his prospects in today's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> voting, despite a dismal single-digit showing in pre-election polls He pointed to <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' `` two favorite sons'' of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, and the short time span since his crucial victories in the South last week launched him as a contender, as an explanation for his anticipated finish behind them and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` The polls have been wrong quite frequently in this race because the voters are thinking for themselves,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` There's a large undecided vote and people are looking for an alternative. `` We've had only a few days to get the message out in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' he said later. He added that he hoped `` we're going to have a stronger result than people now expect.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> avoided setting expectations in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where Democrats hold caucuses on March 26, and where <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has chosen to make a last stand in hopes of salvaging his candidacy that was nearly knocked out in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. `` I never single him out and certainly do n't now,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` ... It's a three-person race now between myself and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. That's the reality, regardless of what's happening in any one state. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said that no matter what the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> outcome, he and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would fight for the nomination across the series of industrial states leading up to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s final primary. `` There are other contests on down the road in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and we're looking forward to those contests _ and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ all the way to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` We're going to compete everywhere and look for an opportunity to punch through,'' he told reporters on his campaign plane. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> depicted himself as the alternative to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` to bring the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> back in the mainstream.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> appeared before the school's super computer, a machine capable of millions of computations in an instant, to call for increased federal money for computer research and education He accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of starving civilian computer research while putting money into military applications. `` We are now on the verge of falling behind <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, once again in a field we pioneered,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who toppled political legend <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, opened his four-year term by challenging <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s residents to help `` clean up our politics.'' `` Hope is diminishing. Attitudes have been damaged. Image is tarnished. Pride has been wounded. We are down but we are not out,'' said <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, inaugurated Monday as <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s 51st governor. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> did not cite the usual litany of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s problems, including high national rankings in unemployment, teen pregnancies, high school dropouts, an almost bankrupt government of a state with a widespread image of political corruption. The former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman takes over a state with an accumulated budget deficit and cash shortfall of as much as $ 1.2 billion, much of it due to the depressed oil industry. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s legislative liasion, <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, said the governor's first order of business would be to order a special legislative session to give him wide budget-cutting authority for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends June 30. The governor grabbed a major political victory even before he took office when the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> approved his choices for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> had said removal of the incumbent officers was needed to ensure that his legislative programs would receive a fair hearing. Standing on the Capitol steps, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> was surrounded by 5,000 people. He was sworn in by former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, the son of another legendary governor, <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s victory will not be limited to the few or the strong. That's not victory. That's just more of the same. We'll bring the whole family on this victory trip,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said `` On behalf of our family, we declare war on ignorance, on racism, on joblessness, on business as usual, on environmental pollution and on dishonest political leadership. ... `` Do we have the character to clean up our politics, to free our political leadership from the stranglehold of the special interests? I say we do.'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> was interrupted frequently by applause, including spirited clapping from <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who conceded a runoff after trailing <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> in his Oct. 24 primary bid for an unprecedented fourth term. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who served as governor from 1972 to 1980 and returned for a third term in 1984, was occupied for much of his last administration defending himself successfully against federal racketeering charges. `` I'm going hunting tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> told reporters when asked how he felt at the moment. `` It's his now.''

<HEAD>Capitol Police Gun Seizures up 147 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Capitol Police seized 1,162 weapons from visitors last year, a 147 percent increase over 1986, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sergeant at arms is lobbying for $ 18.5 million to tighten security. Capitol police are responsible for the Capitol itself, six associated office buildings and the Capitol grounds. Sergeant at Arms <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> says the weapons confiscated last year included an Uzi machine gun, a pistol disguised as a beeper and soda bottles containing explosives. The 1,162 total compared to 470 weapons seized in 1986. The security plan advanced by <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> calls for installing bomb-proof glass in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> visitors' gallery and modifying floor seats in the chamber to protect against bomb blasts, at a cost of $ 4.2 million. Other proposals include a $ 4.7 million emergency telephone system to alert every <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office immediately to a terrorist attack, $ 413,352 worth of additional bomb detectors in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office buildings, a $ 3.5 million electronic card system for access to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> garages, and a $ 5.7 million alarm system connecting home-district offices with local police. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> said most of the weapons were confiscated from visitors who were unaware of gun control restrictions at the Capitol and had no criminal intent. But of the total, 63 people were prosecuted, up from 50 the previous year. Strict anti-terrorist proposals, such as fencing in the Capitol grounds or putting glass enclosures around the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> visitors' galleries, have been widely criticized in the past. Many legislators argue that the Capitol, as a symbol of open democracy, should be easily accessible to the public. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> says this view is unrealistic in view of growing security threats. `` I think everybody _ me included _ would like the easy-going atmosphere of a Mayberry RFD police force, with a friendly cop directing traffic,'' he said in an interview. `` But in this day and time, you also need a high-tech, well-trained police department. You've got to have both.'' <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> outlined his plan last week at a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on a proposed $ 1.96 billion budget for congressional operations during the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. His next step is to seek spending authority from a separate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. Still awaiting final action by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leadership is a more sweeping security plan that calls for a wrought-iron fence around the Capitol Plaza, a parking ban on the plaza and gatehouses to screen visitors before they enter the Capitol grounds. That plan, scaled down from an earlier version, has been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, consisting of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sergeants at arms and Capitol Architect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, but a $ 13 million appropriation to implement the plan remains largely unspent. Meanwhile, hydraulic steel street barricades have been installed at the main traffic entrances to the Capitol to halt unauthorized vehicles, and large concrete flower and shrubbery pots have been placed along driveways and sidewalks to thwart any attempted truck bombings of the Capitol. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> said he hopes the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leadership will meet with their sergeants at arms before the end of April to discuss the broader security plan. He said Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, has endorsed additional proposed security measures in the House.

<HEAD>Secret Army Project Develops Uranium-Steel Armor for Tanks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Army has secretly devised a new armor plating for its main battle tank that combines uranium with steel to produce an almost impenetrable skin, military officials say. `` We're talking about something so good the experts think it will take the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> almost a decade to catch up,'' said one official who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` This is a major advance; a very major advance.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources agreed to discuss the matter Monday after the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> released a brief statement announcing plans to produce `` a new model of the M-1A1 <ORGANIZATION> Abrams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Main </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tank </ORGANIZATION> with significantly better armor.'' `` The armor design modification to the M-1A1 incorporates steel-encased depleted uranium,'' the service said. The development of the new armor has been under way for several years as part of a highly classified `` black'' program, the sources said. The Army relaxed the classification somewhat on Monday only because it had to provide information to production line workers and wanted to allay health concerns about using a radioactive material in a manned vehicle, they added. In Monday's announcement, the service insisted that the depleted uranium would pose no threat to either the soldiers who operated the tanks or to the production workers who built them because of the manner in which the tanks would be fabricated. `` Sealed within the tank, depleted uranium has a very low level of natural radiation, which is well within the acceptable range established by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. `` You would have to sit on this tank for 75 hours straight in order to get the same equivalent radiation as a single chest X-ray,'' added Maj. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> is made for the Army by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at two plants _ in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> _ employing roughly 5,000 production workers. The armor plates are being made at a secret location and then shipped to the assembly lines, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. Depleted uranium is an inert, heavy metal that is unusually dense _ 2 -LCB- times more so than steel. The term `` depleted'' means the uranium does not have sufficient energy to be used for commercial purposes such as in power plants. Depleted uranium has long been used for a variety of civilian and military applications, ranging from the production of canisters for the transport of more highly radioactive materials to certain types of ammunition. In the case of the M-1A1, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> refused to say how much uranium would be incorporated into each tank; where on the tank body the armor with uranium would be located, or how it would produce the new armor. The sources said, however, the new process involved `` weaving'' a thread mesh of uranium into the regular steel armor plating at the time of casting. The process produces an incredibly strong plate that adds `` an insignificant amount of weight,'' they said. `` It's not only the strength of the uranium but the way it's worked into the steel,'' said one official `` The process is still highly classified and nobody's going to say more. `` But the experts say this plating can stop any known Soviet anti-tank round, as well as any of their more advanced rounds in development.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, in its statement, said, `` This improvement culminates several years of research and development to meet recent and continuing improvements in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact anti-armor weapons and will allow the <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> to meet the anticipated threat well into the 1990s.'' The Army has already acquired about 1,500 M-1A1's and they will not be retrofitted with the new armor, the service said. But the remaining 3,000 tanks scheduled for purchase will incorporate the new armor. `` The majority of the improved tanks will be stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where they can most directly contribute to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defenses,'' the service said. The first should arrive `` late this year.'' <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> said the new armor plating would begin showing up on the tank manufacturing lines early this summer. The first completed tank with the new armor will be delivered in October, the spokesman added. <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> declined to say how much the new armor would cost. Each M-1A1 currently costs about $ 2.36 million.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> took relatively gentle pokes at their presidential rivals in today's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary with television commercials that bore none of the ferocity of the Super Tuesday media assault. The three were the only candidates to wage substantial media campaigns in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, both Democrats, were spending in the $ 250,000 range while Republican Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reported a $ 400,000 advertising buy. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., started running ads last Monday but cut them off in a pre-weekend strategy shift and had nothing on the air in the final days before the primary Instead he bought a half-hour of time Saturday night, but his broadcast was beset by technical problems. Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was bypassing <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to focus on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s March 26 caucuses. And neither of the favorite sons, Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and civil rights activist <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, were advertising in their home state. Front-runner <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was running two ads he has used before _ one a biographical spot and the other showing him with world leaders and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The latter says there is a difference between congressional and presidential leadership _ the closest <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gets to criticizing <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was on the air with several ads including a new one in which he stresses his youth and service in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` There's only one choice for a new generation of leadership,'' says the narrator, echoing <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s frequent contention that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ca n't get elected because he represents `` the old politics.'' For his part, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is taking a poke at <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s insistence that the Democratic race is wide open and ripe for a brokered convention. The ad never mentions <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, however. It merely says `` some people'' would like to go back to the days of brokered conventions `` when voters did n't really pick their nominee. ... But you do n't have to do this On Tuesday, you can pick the next president'' by voting for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The low-key tone adopted by all three candidates was a dramatic change from the ads leading up to last week's Super Tuesday contests in 20 states. At that time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> specifically attacked each other's records, character and campaign themes in barbed commercials that did n't hesitate to name names. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held the lead in Democratic delegates going into <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and was making some late progress toward the upper tier of the contest, where polls showed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> neck and neck. In addition to his brokered convention spot, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was using two ads he had run in Super Tuesday states _ one stressing his experience as a chief executive and another in which a union official says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not a `` shot-and-beer kinda guy'' but his economic policies put people to work. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also was running two other ads he had used for Super Tuesday, when he won six states. One spot chides <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies for investing in jobs overseas rather than at home and the other says big chemical polluters, price fixers, corporate law breakers and greedy drug manufacturers `` do n't want <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> to be president'' because he's fought them in the past.

<HEAD>Democratic Chairman Moves To Head Off Convention Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> wants to head off a bruising battle for the party's presidential nomination and would mediate efforts to close ranks behind a probable nominee if nobody finishes the primaries with enough delegates to win. `` When you get to a point when there is someone who is somewhat shy of a mathematical majority, I think the opportunity exists to try to strengthen that person and not weaken him as you come into the convention,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said Monday. The delegates who could tip the balance for such a candidate are the 645 so-called `` super delegates,'' the party leaders, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and governors of states and territories who automatically will be convention delegates because of the offices they hold. Four years ago, 568 convention seats were used for this purpose. `` When we increased those numbers, it was not tokenism,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. `` Their status is that they have to run with and govern with the ticket in the end.'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the super delegates have a `` special responsibility'' to help ensure that the Democratic presidential nomination does not wind up in a political fight that damages the nominee. By the time the primaries and caucuses end in June, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said he believed that one candidate will be considered a clear front-runner and the eventual nominee. That candidate will have developed a consistent record of winning primaries and caucuses, even if he does not have the delegates needed for a first-ballot victory at the national convention, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. At that point, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said he would meet with the candidates and `` say, ` OK, here's where we are and here's where we have to be in November. Now, what do we have to do to maximize those opportunities?''' `` I do n't want to leave the impression that <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s going to be the broker,'' the party chairman said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I'm not going to dictate to anyone because it does n't work that way. However, he said he would be `` in the middle'' of efforts to avoid harm that could be done to a probable nominee if a political battle erupted just before or during the convention. The Democrats conclude their delegate selection on June 7 with primaries in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which combined account for more than 400 national convention delegates. `` The whole thing is to avoid that brokering process taking place in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anbender </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>. `` I think that he's been floating this idea with elected officials and party officials for some time.'' The Democratic National Convention is July 18-21 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The suggestion that the Democratic presidential nomination would have to be brokered came after a clear front-runner failed to emerge in contests to date. The party has already picked more than 40 percent of its national convention delegates. `` I do n't discount the possibility that there will be a first-ballot mathematical majority after you get through with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. `` I think that is still likely.'' Winning the presidential nomination takes at least 2,082 delegates, and so far no candidate has even one-fourth of that number. The super delegates, some of whom cast just fractions of votes under party rules, are not required to pledge their allegiance to any presidential candidate before the convention, although some of them have. Of the super delegates, 240.65 say they remain uncommitted, while another 115.35 have come out in support of one candidate or another. The remainder either have not responded to inquiries or have not yet been selected. In the latter category are 253 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who are to be picked at party caucuses April 19-20, when <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> hopes to get a significant boost for his sagging presidential prospects. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> holds the No. 4 leadership position in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> declined to offer any opinion on <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s statement, saying only that `` we have no problems with the party chairman at all.'' When asked whether the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign supported a proposal to rally support behind whoever is the leader after June 7, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the idea of some sort of brokering process in June was `` hypothetical.'' The current leader in the Democratic presidential field is <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has 462.5 delegates, followed by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 423.55 and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> with 352.8.

 The government's new trade-and-aid program to help American farmers by sending emissaries to foreign countries is almost ready for launching. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> announced Monday that the first trip will be this spring to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The exact dates have to be negotiated with the countries. The mission will include representatives from the departments of Agriculture and State, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Three to six representatives of the private sector also will be selected for the trips. `` During my recent trip to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, I discussed possible missions with the leaders and key agricultural officials of both countries,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. `` We agreed that these missions would not only address the food needs of these countries, but would help develop customers for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports as well.'' The trips are required by the Agricultural Aid and Trade Missions Act, passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> late last year. It specified that 16 missions be conducted in 1988, with eight completed by June. By offering specially designed packages of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and food assistance, the goal of the program is to help the designated countries develop and to become larger markets for American farmers. `` Private sector involvement will ensure more effective identification of trade and investment opportunities for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. `` The recipient countries will benefit from the technology and managerial expertise that can best be transferred by the private sector.'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> added: `` This exchange helps foster development in the recipient countries, which in turn expands the long-term demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports.'' <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, a former secretary of agriculture and now head of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, is an enthusiastic supporter of the trade-and-aid law, calling it `` the most promising agricultural legislation since the passage of Public Law 480 in 1954,'' the Food for Peace program. `` The bottom line is to use all existing resources to lay the groundwork for expanded business with developing countries which have the potential for explosive market growth,'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said recently. As described by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, each mission will: _ Meet with appropriate foreign and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in each country to help in planning the extent to which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and aid can be used to meet the food and economic needs in that country _ Provide technical help and information on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural commodities and the trade and aid program _ Help obtain firm commitments for food aid programs and commodity sales `` Within 60 days after completion of a mission, the representatives must report to the president and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on their findings and recommendations,'' the agency said. Further, beginning in December 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and AID must submit quarterly reports to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the progress made on each mission's recommendations.

 <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> production is rising faster than <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economists had previously forecast. The number of turkey eggs in incubators on March 1 was estimated at 32.1 million, up almost 4 percent from a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. Moreover, 23.1 million new turkey poults were placed in flocks last month, a 2 percent increase from placements a year earlier, said the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. In an earlier report, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said turkey output climbed 18 percent in 1987 to a record level. By the third quarter market prices had dropped below break-even prices. However, prices climbed dramatically in November and December, putting fourth-quarter returns close to the break-even level. `` Because no two consecutive quarters had strong negative net returns, producers probably did not get an intense signal to slow growth,'' the agency said in the March issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. `` Production is now forecast to rise 10 percent in 1988, up from the earlier forecast of 6 percent.'' Wholesale prices of hen turkeys weighing 8 pounds to 16 pounds averaged about 61 cents per pound in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the report said. Prices in the first and second quarters of 1988 are expected to be in the range of 48 cents to 52 cents and then rise seasonally in the third and fourth. For all of 1988, the wholesale price may average 50 cents to 56 cents per pound, compared with 57.8 cents in 1987, the report said.

 A larger 1987 harvest and a bigger inventory have put pressure on potato prices this season, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Total output last year rebounded almost 7 percent to an estimated 385.7 million hundredweight, although still 3 percent shy of the 1985 record, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Stocks of fresh potatoes on Jan. 1 were up 8 percent from a year earlier. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> russets sold for $ 13.50 to $ 14 per hundredweight at the end of January, compared with $ 17.50 to $ 19 the year before. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> round whites, at $ 5.80 to $ 6 per hundredweight, were down from $ 8.10 to $ 8.50 a year earlier, the agency reported. Overall, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> average grower price of potatoes in January was $ 3.60 per hundredweight, down 25 percent from a year earlier.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> early Tuesday refused to halt the execution at dawn of convicted killer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, who survived an unprecedented six death warrants and became an international cause celebre. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, who has maintained his innocence in the 1973 slaying of a <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> businessman during a robbery, was scheduled to die in the electric chair at 7 a.m. at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> near this <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> town. The high court, in a 6-3 vote, denied a stay, as did a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier in the day `` I'm going to holler, I'm going to holler loud, and I'm not going to stop hollering, and I'll be hollering, ` Innocent, innocent, innocent' if they put me in the chair,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said in an interview taped earlier Monday and shown on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline.'' `` If I had committed such a crime, I would have a guilty conscience all these years. I could not have lived with it,'' he said. His case has become focus of an international campaign against capital punishment. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and Soviet dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had made appeals on his behalf. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s attorneys raised several claims on appeal, including reports of new evidence and arguments that the 54-year-old <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> had ineffective legal counsel. In <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> was put to death in the electric chair early Tuesday for the 1978 slaying of a rookie policeman. The the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday had refused in a 7-2 vote to halt the execution. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> had claimed his wartime service in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War had made him insane, and pleaded with the jury to impose the death penalty to keep him from killing again. He later withdrew the request and fought his execution. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s appeals already had gone to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> four times. The last was rejected March 7 and Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> signed <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s seventh death warrant the next day. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> on Monday dismissed suggestions he was rushing the execution. `` It's been 15 years,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` I think of the victim at a moment like this and the family which was destroyed. A hideous murder took place and that's what I keep in mind. Just because it's 15 years later, that does n't reduce a crime that was committed at the time. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> was condemned for the shooting of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Turman </PERSON>, who interrupted a man robbing his wife, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, of $ 15. Mrs. <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> later identified <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> as the assailant. `` I think it was all very fair and <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> was the one who did it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> radio station WONN. `` I was in the store alone with him for a long time before <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> came in and was shot. ... His face is still impressed in the back of my memory. I ca n't get it out.'' A neighbor, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, also identified <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> during the trial. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, then 16, entered the store after apparently hearing the shooting and Mrs. <PERSON> Turman </PERSON>'s cries and was shot three times. If executed, <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> will be the 18th man <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has put to death since May 1979. Those men died after three or fewer warrants. Death penalty opponents claim <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> was railroaded because he is black, and that he is innocent of murder and has an alibi to prove it. They claim there is evidence _ statements from a minister and another person _ that <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> could not have committed the murder. The signing of the warrant last week gave defense attorneys only one week to prepare. `` A lot of people feel the primary reason for the seven-day warrant was to limit <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to have sufficient time to mobilize a public opinion assault as they did very effectively for the sixth warrant,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> Collateral Representative, a state-funded office of defense attorneys for death row inmates. Several hundred phone calls and telegrams had been received at the governor's office in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, most in favor of clemency. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on the Poor held a vigil in the Capitol rotunda Monday to press for clemency. In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, about a dozen people demonstrated Monday outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, urging <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to commute <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s death sentence. The protest was sponsored by the Swedish chapter of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which charged in a statement that `` death sentences in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are handed down with a great deal of discrimination and with a racial slant.'' `` Since January, I have received close to 2,000 letters from around the world,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published Sunday in which he maintained his innocence.

 Prominent Israeli peace activists say American Jews who refuse to criticize the occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> are hurting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. By remaining silent, the activists said, many American Jews have signaled endorsement of the policies of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, thereby increasing the credibility of his views. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> arrived here Monday for talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The peace activists planned a prayer vigil outside the White House when <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> meets with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday. But the activists said the Americans Jews opposed to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> should make their views known. Those expressions could help curb the `` terrifying phenomenon'' in which <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> voters are moving to the right, said <PERSON> Yael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON>, daughter of the late <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON>. `` On the whole, American Jews are not behind <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s policy,'' said <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-On </PERSON>, a founder of the Israeli group, Peace Now. `` They must speak out now.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is reluctant to cede to the Palestinians land in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, two areas seized by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the Six-Day War of 1967. His views are opposed by many <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, who favor a more conciliatory approach towards the Palestinians. <PERSON> Giora </PERSON> <PERSON> Furman </PERSON>, former deputy commander of the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said it is unrealistic for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to hang on to the territories in the face of the determined <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising. The peace group wants <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to endorse the return of some land to the Palestinians, which is part of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace proposal. `` I am very upset with what is happening to the American Jewish community,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON> said, adding it was `` rubbish'' for American Jews to hold their tongues when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> does something morally wrong. Ms. <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON> said Americans should write members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders. But using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid as a lever to force change could be counterproductive because the money _ about $ 1.5 billion annually _ is spent on worthy causes, she said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, said the peace activists should be directing its criticism at the Arab leaders who refuse to meet with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials. `` The group is misdirected as to where its criticism is being put,'' he said.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> says that seven weeks of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> testimony have produced nothing to bar the speedy ratification of the new arms reduction treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> angrily dismissed an allegation by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, that the administration's public defense of the pact is based on `` misrepresentation'' and is at odds with facts presented in closed-door secret sessions. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should firmly discard all proposed amendments or reservations to the treaty, including one that would tie its implementation to reversing Soviet superiority in conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He ticked off objections that have been mounted to the terms of the pact, which bans medium-range nuclear missiles, and asserted that all those objections have been refuted. The secretary of state, whose testimony opened the committee's examination of the treaty in January, commented as he made a return appearance to offer a summing up Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy majority leader and a respected vote counter, predicted that the pact will be ratified by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by a margin far greater than the required two-thirds majority <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will act well in advance of a planned <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting this spring between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` We believe the treaty stands on its merits,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` It is self-contained and should not be made a vehicle for statements on other issues,'' including the Soviet military occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But he bristled after hearing <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> declare that there is `` a wide gap between the administration's public representations about the treaty and the information which we have received in closed session.'' `` Indeed,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said, `` after many hours of listening to testimony both private and public, the administration's public presentation of the treaty has been a tissue of confusion, misstatements and _ and I use the word advisedly _ even misrepresentations.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>: `` In a sense I do n't know what I'm doing here. Are you sitting here accusing me of deliberately misrepresenting? ... I can handle it fine when people say they do n't agree with me, but when they say I have misrepresented, I have trouble with that.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said he was not accusing <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> of `` deliberately'' misrepresenting, but he added that `` the contradictions are self-apparent.'' Replying to questions, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage of an amendment delaying implementation of the treaty until the West achieved a balance with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in conventional arms would kill the pact. The pact, formally termed the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF treaty, calls for the destruction of all nuclear missiles with a range of between 300 miles and 3,400 miles. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he does not believe the treaty will cause <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to demand the removal of all nuclear weapons from its soil _ a step that some fear could open <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to intimidation by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which is said to have superiority in conventional, non-nuclear forces.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities fell in the latest auction, with six-month bills dropping to the lowest level since last July. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 6.5 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.65 percent on Monday, down from 5.74 percent last week. An additional $ 6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.78 percent, down from 5.93 percent last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 5.62 percent on Feb. 29 and six-month bills averaged 5.54 percent on July 13, 1987.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union has set a new March 29 target for its 6,700 member flight attendants to strike <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> armed with a pledge that mechanics and baggage handlers will honor picket lines. `` Anyone who is thinking of flying <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> during the Easter holidays should forget it,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, director of the union's airline division, told reporters Monday after announcing the strike deadline. Northwest officials expressed immediate skepticism that the union will carry out its threat, but said the airline has management workers and replacement attendants in training to keep the airline operating if it does. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> have set many deadlines ... and flight attendants continue to work,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` We'll just have to see if this deadline has any more validity than others the union has announced.'' Genoese met several hours at Teamster headquarters here with <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s District 143 in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, which represents <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 20,000 mechanics and baggage handlers. `` I have no doubt that the membership I represent will honor any work stoppage,'' said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> `` We've got our own problems in negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>. If they want a war, they probably are going to get one.'' The Teamsters earlier had threatened to strike Northwest the last weekend of February, when a 30-day cooling-off period ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> expired. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, has announced it will unilaterally impose a new policy manual on April 1 replacing the old flight attendants' contract and stretching out from five years to eight years the time required for a newly hired attendant to reach top scale. Absent from Monday's meeting were representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 2,300 Northwest pilots. `` The pilots have told us that when the time comes, they will do the right thing,'' Genoese said. Leaders of <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> locals could not be reached for comment. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON>, a spokeman at the pilot union's headquarters here, said its policy is to `` not announce any decision on whether to support a strike by another union unless or until a strike occurs and a picket line goes up. Under the National Railway Labor Act governing labor relations in the rail and airline industries, courts have frequently ordered members of unions not on strike themselves but honoring another union's picket line to return to work. Terms of a two-tier, A and B, wage system at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> under which new hires reach the pay level of veterans have been the major stumbling block in the bargaining talks between the airline and the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. The union originally proposed eliminating the lower B scale entirely but had agreed to stretch it to six years before the talks broke off. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s last contract proposal included raising base pay for beginning flight attendants on the B scale would climb from $ 13,000 to $ 15,000 over a five-year period. Base pay for full-time veterans on the top A scale would rise from $ 32,000 to $ 35,000 under the same offer.

<HEAD>Erase Gephardt Trade Plan, Senators Urge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Senators are starting to push their House counterparts in earnest to erase the trade plan that serves as the centerpiece of Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s race for the presidential nomination. `` We decided to stick with our own Super 301 plan and to oppose the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment,'' Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Monday after a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees on the trade issue. As part of the action, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will ask the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to drop the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> plan from the final version of sweeping trade legislation passed by both houses last year. The decision was made by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members of a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee seeking a compromise version of the rival 1,000-page trade bills. It came on a voice vote in a closed-door session of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees. The move represents step one in a compromise process involving proposals that go back and forth between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> until both chambers agree on one version. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action represented `` nothing new'' in the trade debate. `` It's merely an opening bargaining position,'' he said. `` We're confident that whatever emerges from conference will be new, forceful legislation to open foreign markets And clearly the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment paved the way.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s plan calls for negotiations to reduce <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s and other nations' `` excess and unwarranted'' trade surpluses with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If those talks failed, the plan would prescribe presidential action to cut the surpluses by 10 percent a year. Such action could include tariffs or import quotas on Japanese goods brought into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The president could, however, take no action if there are considerations of `` national economic security'' or if the other country had a serious international debt problem. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s amendment has been the chief basis of his appeal to blue-collar workers and others concerned over the impact on American jobs of products imported from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and newly industrialized nations in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The `` Super 301'' provision that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is pushing would require the president to act to eliminate all of the unfair foreign trade practices listed on an inventory to be drawn up by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative. It is named for the section of the Trade Act that deals with retaliatory steps against such unfair practices. Before sending their offer to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the senators planned to return to the table today and fashion additional provisions involving steps to combat `` dumping,'' or selling foreign-made products in world markets at prices lower than those in home markets. The senators also intend to work on provisions involving `` countervailing duties,'' or tariffs that are imposed to offset the price advantage that some foreign-made products get from export subsidies in their home countries. On Monday, the senators moved to expand from seven months to 12 months the time for the president to make a determination as to whether a foreign trade practice should be considered unfair.

 <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>, who had pleaded with a jury to impose the death penalty to keep him from killing again, was executed in the electric chair early Tuesday for the 1978 slaying of a rookie policeman. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>, 38, went to his death at 12:14 a.m. after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> late Monday refused in a 7-2 vote to stay the execution. `` You can kill the messenger but you ca n't kill the message,'' he said in his final statement. `` Sooner or later, you have to acknowledge it for what it means, not for what you want it to mean.'' He gave no indication what he referred to, but paused so that witnesses could write it down. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> was convicted of shooting a policeman in the back in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> while being taken to jail in handcuffs for drunkenness. An Army veteran of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> had claimed at trial that his wartime experience had made him insane. The execution occurred less than a day after Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> was inaugurated. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>'s lawyers had planned to ask the governor to stop the execution until a new pardon board could consider the case. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> had said earlier he would not intervene. In <LOCATION> Starke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, who survived an unprecedented six death warrants and became an international cause celebre, awaited execution in the electric chair early Tuesday for the 1973 slaying of a businessman during a robbery. The last time there was more than one execution in one day in this country was Aug. 28, when murderers were put to death in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> was the first person in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to use his <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> service as the basis for a criminal insanity plea. He said finding Viet Cong tunnels and being exposed to the chemical Agent Orange left him subject to flashbacks and unable to tell right from wrong when he pulled a gun hidden in his pants and shot Officer <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomkins </PERSON> while being taken to jail in handcuffs. In 1980, a jury convicted him of first-degree murder, which carries life in prison or death in the electric chair. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> asked for the death penalty, `` or other deaths will result.'' `` It's happened twice in eight years. There's been 10 years of proof shown to you,'' he told the jury. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> at the time of the slaying was a fugitive from a work release program in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, where he had been convicted of manslaughter. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> withdrew his request after the trial, and his appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was based in part on his claim that he was denied competent representation because his attorney at trial joined him in asking for the death sentence. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> appeared unsuccessfully before the pardon board appointed by <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s predecessor, Gov. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, two weeks ago. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>'s lawyers, argued that the old board was tainted by a pardon-selling scandal that sent the board chairman to jail. He said <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> should refer the case to the new board he appoints. Ninety-four people have been executed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including 15 in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, since the death penalty was revived following a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in the 1970s. The most recent occurred Jan. 7 when <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Streetman </PERSON> was executed by injection in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for murdering a woman in 1982. The most recent execution in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was Aug. 24.

 Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s doctors are discussing treatment to prevent more blood clots like the one just discovered in one of the senator's lungs. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that the clot in the lung was dissolving, but treatment would likely be needed to prevent further clots. Doctors could use anti-coagulant drugs or a surgical procedure, <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, 45, was admitted to the hospital Sunday. He underwent an operation at <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> on Feb. 12 to repair an aneurysm _ the ballooning of an artery wall _ in an artery supplying blood to the brain. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> was recovering at home from that operation and waiting for an operation on a second aneurysm when he had to re-enter the hospital. `` Medical tests show that the senator did experience a pulmonary embolism, or a blood clot, that lodged in one of his lungs,'' <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> said. `` The clot, which could have resulted from decreased activity following major surgery, did no damage. Medical tests are continuing to determine the method of lessening the chances of other clots developing,'' he said. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> said the alternative to anti-coagulant drugs is to insert a venous filter, a form of catheter, in a vein.

 Students at the nation's only liberal arts college for the deaf greeted the week with jubilation, as they were formally introduced to the first deaf president and first deaf board chairman in <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s history. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON> received standing ovations Monday from the same students who effectively shut down the 124-year-old institution over appointment of a woman with normal hearing to be president. `` People will look at us and study what we are doing,'' said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a 44-year-old professor and dean of the college of arts and sciences at <LOCATION> Gallaudet </LOCATION>. `` We will prove to them, not only can they choose a deaf president and chairman, but that these two will succeed.'' The two officials were joined at a news conference by student body president <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Hlibok </PERSON>, one of the campus leaders in the week of protest over the hiring of <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> as president.

<TEXT>
 Roman Catholic church leaders, who have called on Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down, offered to mediate talks between the military strongman and opposition political groups demanding his ouster. But church officials also said on Monday that it may be difficult `` to build a silver bridge for -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- to leave,'' now that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. Since then, the country has fallen into a deepening financial crisis that occurred after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed several new economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including the withholding of $ 6.5 million in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> fees due this week. It earlier cut off all economic and military aid to the country. The 118 local and foreign banks that do business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> remained closed Monday by government order for the 20th straight day. `` The church still hopes to act as a bridge. There is no question that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go ... The problem is how he goes,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON>, a top church spokesman and vicar of the archdiocese, said Monday. Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, has been criticial of the government in the past, but always avoided direct confrontation to protect his priests, nearly 75 percent of whom are foreigners. Under Panamanian law, they must have their visas renewed every three months by immigration authorities, which come under <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief and the nation's de facto ruler, ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Feb. 26 after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We are under pressure,'' said <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON>, a Panamanian, explaining that foreign priests who tried to speak out in the past were often threatened and reminded that they can lose their visas. `` They have not expelled any of our priests, but they have us by the neck.'' The country's bishops, in a statements that mentioned no names, have accused the military regime of being responsible for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis The bishops urged `` strict observance of constitutional norms, full and effective subordination of the military to civil authority,'' the creation of conditions for free elections, `` the restoration of civil liberties and human rights,'' and asked that `` news media be allowed to reopen.'' The bishops also lashed out at the military for resorting `` to false nationalism'' to whip up support for the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government, but called for a `` Panamanian solution to the crisis without foreign intervention.'' The bishops also offered on Monday to act as a `` liaison'' to seek a solution to the crisis, but there was no answer from the government. Official government media accused the Church of siding with the oppostion. `` People were fed up with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> since last year,'' <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON> said, `` but the indictment by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was politically mishandled. The government party and other groups here threw their support to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will hang in there longer and eventually drag others with him.'' `` They -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- closed all avenues,'' Father <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON> added. `` It is very difficult for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> now to go somewhere with the indictment hanging over his head. But he has to realize that he msut go. About 80 percent of the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, struggling to make legislating a more orderly affair, put itself on a new work schedule this year and tightened up its procedures. The change produced unintended consequences. Under the new schedule the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> works in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for three straight weeks, then permits senators to return to their home states for a full week to attend to their constituents. The purpose of the change was to disband the so-called Tuesday-Thursday club, named for the age-old practice of many senators who left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday evenings and did not return until the following Tuesdays. Now when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is meeting senators are expected to attend, Monday through Friday, no exceptions. There have been other changes as well. Roll call votes, which often were prolonged for an hour or more while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> waited for an absent member to arrive from the airport or from a meeting across town, were limited to a strict 15 minutes each, no exceptions. And that caused the problem. The three <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office buildings are linked to the Capitol by an underground subway. For years that subway has routinely and efficiently served two of those buildings _ the <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and the Dirksen. But the tunnel which was extended to the new <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> is far longer, as is the trip to the Capitol. And the Hart Building contains the offices of 50 of the 100 senators. Last month, seven or eight senators hurried to the <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> subway station with only minutes to spare to make a roll call. But the car was jammed with visitors. `` There were unusual circumstances,'' Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., told his colleagues `` There were some blind people on the subway car and it took some time to get them off.'' The 15-minute clock ticked to an end and <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> and his colleagues missed the vote. They demanded a solution to their transportation problem and a solution was provided. Tourists and other visitors were banned from the cars during roll call votes. And a subway car will now depart the <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> subway station precisely three minutes before the end of a 15-minute vote, giving senators just enough time to reach the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber and cast their votes. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and its subway cars roll on.

 <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolich </PERSON>'s watch stopped at 2:53 p.m. on the day he tumbled 40 feet from a tree behind his home. And for more than a year, so did his life. Doctors and family feared he would never recover from a coma. Last month, the 12-year-old won the <ORGANIZATION> Sumner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> spelling bee _ by spelling the word `` hypodermic.'' `` I knew I had that one,'' <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> said, grinning. <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>, the older of two sons of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolich </PERSON>, is now a lanky seventh-grader with only traces of the injury doctors said would leave him comatose the rest of his life. His walk is almost back to normal and he only occasionally responds slowly to questions. His brain stem has healed and he has regained use of the left side of his body. In February, he completed a cross-country skiing course and was readmitted to his junior high school's gifted program. `` My verbal IQ is back up to 124,'' he said in a recent interview. `` That's 24 points away from <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>. Write that down.'' He does n't remember much, however, about the July 14, 1986, accident at his home in <LOCATION> Sumner </LOCATION>, about 10 miles east of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>. `` I was in this humongous tree playing with a bunch of friends. It seems I either got dizzy or a branch broke,'' he said. For the next two months, the comatose boy was treated at <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samaritan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Puyallup </LOCATION>, the trauma unit at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> and finally <ORGANIZATION> Orchard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>. He remembers nothing about the coma except for one thought days before he woke up: `` I was dreaming about stuff like being home and eating spaghetti and French bread.'' He came home the day before Halloween, and immediately began therapy at Good Samaritan. He still attends sessions three times a week, and doctors expect the sessions to continue for two or three more years. `` Given the severity of his injuries, he's a real miracle,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Puyallup </LOCATION>. `` He has tremendous spirit and he'll go far. We're looking beyond high school to college.'' <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON>, who specializes in rehabilitation medicine, said Monday <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>'s success is due to his youth, his family and his intelligence. His rapid recovery was used as an example at a recent <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Injury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> can ride his bike and cross-country ski, he still ca n't be left unattended, <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON> said, because his agility and sense of judgment are slightly impaired. He wears a helmet on his bike because doctors fear another head injury could send him into another coma. Mrs. <PERSON> Nicolich </PERSON>, a housewife whose husband is a construction worker, said she's amazed at <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>'s recovery. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and I have done the best we can, but if it was n't for <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> striving so hard, it would n't have happened,'' she said. `` I told him if I could give him a Purple Heart for his courage, I would.'' <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> is also aware of the changes. `` I guess I'm special,'' he said. `` I was a regular ` brainiac' before the accident I used to get straight A's. Now I have a B minus. I'm pretty amazed I made the spelling bee even though I won a lot of them before. `` I just want to be treated like a regular <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmo </PERSON>, really,'' he added. `` Some of my friends tease me and tell me I have brain damage, but they stick up for me.''

<HEAD>Revised Medicaid Rules Shift Costs to Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Up to 50 percent of the low-income elderly people would have to pay an extra $ 50 to $ 75 a month for their Medicaid-funded nursing home care under new regulations that take effect next month. The new regulations are meant to enable states to `` shift more of the financial responsibility for the cost of nursing home care to the recipient,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said in a notice published Feb. 8 in the Federal Register. The regulations are scheduled to take effect April 8. From 20 percent to 50 percent of institutionalized Medicaid recipients would be affected, the department said. Savings to the state and federal government would total $ 160 million to $ 615 million from 1987 to 1989. Medicaid recipients pay a certain percentage of their income for nursing home care after deducting medical costs not covered by their state <ORGANIZATION> Medicaid </ORGANIZATION> plan _ for example, eyeglasses or hearing aids. Under the new rule, states will be allowed to eliminate or curtail these deductions for the first time. <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> said states most likely will restrict income deductions for services they believe have marginal or questionable therapeutic value. `` It appears highly likely that the major impact of this regulation will fall on providers of non-institutional services such as physicians, dentists, and physical and occupational therapists,'' the department said.

The four _ <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> co-founder <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON>, former vice chairman <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, ex-president <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Guariglia </PERSON> and former executive vice president <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorten </PERSON> _ have pleaded guilty to state and federal charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in return for leniency. They have yet to be sentenced. Before their plea bargain was struck, <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> said, they offered a bribe to <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and a key figure in an investigation of a proposed $ 1 billion Iraqi pipeline. <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials told <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>: `` We'll give you $ 200,000 for your friend <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. Get to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. Get us foreign asylum.'' At a second meeting, <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> said, the same money was offered to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who was told: `` Get us an assurance that we wo n't go to jail.'' <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> gave them that assurance. `` So the people who are going to take the stand here and testify ... they were trying to buy the attorney general of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> charged. He appeared to indicate that the money was never paid. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, one of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, said he had spoken with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> about <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON>'s remarks. `` There was never any request that he -LRB- <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> -RRB- get involved in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> investigation in any way. He never did. He never would have contemplated doing that. It's preposterous to think that there's any scintilla of truth to that account,'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> said the four `` lied, stole, plundered and raped'' the company, a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> defense contractor now in bankruptcy proceedings. They created a $ 14 million slush fund, from which they stole $ 5 million and `` the rest of the money was used to pay off people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, union people'' and others, <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> said. `` Not one penny went to <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, 70, the city's senior congressman; his eldest son; the elder <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s law partner and four others are charged with racketeering for allegedly demanding millions of dollars in bribes to help the company win government contracts. <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> claimed the no-bid contracts that transformed <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> from a small machine shop into a $ 100 million-a-year defense contractor were awarded through White House influence. He said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, then President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff, passed the word to officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that `` the president wants these contracts to go to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>.'' Former White House aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was convicted last month of illegal lobbying for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> soon after he left the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. A special prosecutor in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said in December that there was insufficient evidence to charge <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> with any wrongdoing in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. The investigation is continuing. The prosecutor also is investigating <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s role in the pipeline as a result of a memo written to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> mentioning planned payments to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a bid to protect the project in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> from Israeli attack.

 A 60-Marine security force and a 44-man <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> military police unit have been sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to help safeguard <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel and facilities in that Central American nation, the Pentagon says. `` This is simply a prudent measure to augment the security personnel who are already in place,'' Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prucha </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Monday, the day the additional personnel were shipped out. The Marine group includes a six-man dog handling team. The Marines left from <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> group from <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. There are currently about 600 servicemen assigned to security duties in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which is headquartered there, <PERSON> Prucha </PERSON> said. All told, there are about 10,000 American troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been using financial pressure in a bid to oust Panamanian strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` and we do n't want to be caught unprepared if he responds by trying to sabotage canal equipment or other facilities,'' said one official. Sources said the Marine unit was `` a fleet anti-terrorist security team'' that could be used to keep watch on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, an oil pipeline that carries Alaskan oil across <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> unit, a so-called `` air base ground defense flight,'' is trained in maintaining security around the perimeters of military bases, the officials said. While there is no evidence of sabotage and no reason at this point to anticipate an attack on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities by Panamanians, `` there have been a number of bomb scares recently,'' said one official. `` We do n't want to overreact, but we do n't want to get caught flat-footed, either,'' said another source. Capt. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLuntas </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said Monday there had been no change in the alert status for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and that the lowest form of alert _ `` Alpha'' _ was still in place. `` We are not sending in combat troops,'' the spokeswoman stressed. `` These are police and security units.''

 A <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who said his years of bloody combat left him unable to tell right from wrong went to his death early today for shooting a rookie policeman in the back three times. `` You can kill the messenger but you ca n't kill the message,'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>, 38, said in a cryptic, two-sentence final statement. `` Sooner or later, you have to acknowledge it for what it means, not for what you want it to mean.'' As <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> died, three policemen from <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> stood in the cold at the prison gate with a group of five other supporters of `` victims' rights,'' including some relatives of murder victims. `` Justice is being done tonight. I hate it took 10 years,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>'s murder victim, <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> Officer <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>. The execution, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s 16th since it resumed capital punishment in 1983 and one of two scheduled for today, came after <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>'s lawyers failed on two fronts to win last-minute postponements. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled 7-2 late Monday to let the execution proceed. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who was inaugurated earlier in the day, also did not stop it. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>'s lawyers, said he thought <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> would postpone the execution until he could appoint a new pardon board to consider the case. The outgoing pardon board rejected <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>'s appeal less than two weeks ago. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> should not stand on that ruling since it came from a board scarred earlier by a pardon-selling scandal that sent the board chairman to jail. Warden <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> told him as the hour grew near that he did not want the execution called off. It was a return to the stance <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> took at his trial, when the jury found him guilty and he told them to execute him to prevent more killing. He already had been convicted in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> of manslaughter and was in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> because he had escaped from a work-release program there. `` All I can advise you all is to give me the death penalty in this case ... or other deaths will result,'' he said, describing himself as a walking time bomb. He changed his mind, however, and helped in his appeals as he fought to stay alive, saying he was not mentally competent when he told the jury he wanted to die. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> was the first person in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to use <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for a criminal insanity plea. He had joined the Army at 18 and was sent in 1967 to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> where he was among the men who ferreted out <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> tunnels. He said it ruined him and he could n't tell right from wrong when he was arrested by <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> for drunkenness in 1979. Although handcuffed and put in the back seat of the police car, <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> got a gun out of his pants and shot <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> three times in the back. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, who survived an unprecedented six death warrants and became an international cause celebre over capital punishment, awaited execution early today for the 1973 slaying of a businessman during a robbery. The last time there was more than one execution in one day in this country was Aug. 28, when murderers were put to death in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has levied fines totaling $ 100,000 against three Japanese firms whose ships were videotaped apparently fishing illegally in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in early January. The civil fines of $ 25,000 per vessel involved are the maximum allowed under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. `` This underscores how seriously we viewed the violations,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, a deputy general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. He said the Japanese companies can seek an administrative hearing on the fines if they decide to appeal. `` This action should send a powerful message to any fisherman who is thinking about fishing illegally in our waters,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON>, D-Wash. The fines were based on a review of the videotapes and depositions taken from commercial fishermen who chartered a plane and photographed the vessels with their nets down allegedly 38 miles inside the American fishing zone, said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. Two of the vessels videotaped are owned and operated by <ORGANIZATION> Hamaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which was fined a total of $ 50,000, said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Removal Of Cardinal Seen As Political Manuever</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> was removed as mediator of the peace talks because he wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to discuss political reforms as well as a cease-fire with the Contras, sources said. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> diplomatically eased <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo from his job as mediator on March 2, thanking him for his efforts but saying the cardinal would not be needed for direct talks scheduled for next week. The manuever effectively removed the Roman Catholic prelate from pushing what were seen by the leftist Sandinista government as pro-Contra proposals. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has called for three days of face-to-face talks with the Contras beginning Monday in the Nicaraguan post at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> on the border with <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said his brother, Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the nation's top military leader, would head the Sandinista delegation. The Contras countered by naming <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, their highest political leader, to head their delegation. Sandinista sources and opposition figures, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> because he outlined a proposal that would force the government to discuss internal politics with the rebels. The government has refused to discuss anything but a cease-fire. During the last round of talks on Feb. 18 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> called on the Sandinista government to grant total amnesty, revise the military draft law, grant full press freedom and reopen stalled talks with internal opposition parties. He also suggested a 30-day truce. The Contras quickly accepted the proposal. The Sandinistas hesitated. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>, saying the two sides were at an impasse, broke off the talks the following day. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Feb. 23 sent the cardinal an angry letter, decrying the talks' `` abrupt suspension without consulation.'' The letter was the first in a week of exchanges between the government and the Catholic leader. The letters also sent signals that church-state relations had once again deteriorated in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The strong <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> backed the 1979 revolution that ousted dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> and supported the Sandinistas. But the church later became the staunchest government critic and suffered repression. Since the signing of a regional peace plan in August by five Central American presidents including <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the situation seemed to be improving. The government allowed two exiled priests to return, permitted the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> station to reopen and in November asked the cardinal to be mediator. The cardinal's last letter to <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> was sent March 2, hours before <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> removed him as mediator. In it, the prelate reiterated the need for talks to `` put an end to the grueling war that daily claims 50 or 60 young Nicaraguans'' and said he was open to discussing a new outline for negotiations. A church source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> hoped to pressure <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> into backing out of his mediation role. When that failed, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> made his move and visited <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo that night. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> made it look like he was deferring to the cardinal's wishes `` The cardinal himself had suggested some time ago that a direct meeting -LRB- with the Contras -RRB- and in our country would be very important,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. For the past four years, <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> has urged direct talks. But the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had repeatedly refused to sit down with the Contras until they were forced to do so by the regional peace plan. The plan signed by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> calls for cease-fires, democratization, amnesties and an end to tactical or logistical support for insurgencies. The Sandinistas say peace talks should be held with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government because it financed and trained the rebels. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration refuses. During the first few rounds of talks aimed at working out a cease-fire, the cardinal acted as a go-between in indirect negotiations. In January, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> proposed direct talks but with a mediator. After <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> was asked to step down as mediator, the Contras demanded he be involved in the meetings `` as witness, moderator and guarantor of the talks.'' The president responded on March 7 by calling on the cardinal to act as a witness, a role he accepted and which satisfied the rebels. The first direct talks in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> were scheduled for last week, March 9-11, but were canceled at the last minute by <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> after the Contras backed out and pressed for a preliminary meeting. The Contras later dropped that demand. More than 40,000 people have been killed since November 1981, when the Contras began fighting the Sandinista government.

 A chief accuser of impeached Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> got legal advice on how to deal with <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from the lawyer who has become acting Gov. Rose Mofford's chief of staff. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>, who also served as chief of staff during part of <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s governorship, confirmed Monday that he provided legal advice to Department of Public Safety Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> for reduced fees. The attorney-client relationship with <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> is not disclosed on <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>'s conflict-of-interest forms but he confirmed it after The Associated Press learned of it. `` I just do n't see that it was necessary,'' he said. `` There certainly is no personal interest here. I do n't gain or lose anything at all. `` Am I a longstanding friend of <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>? That's pretty clear,'' he added. `` The fact that I like him I do n't think is a big issue.'' <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> testified at <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial that the governor ordered him not to cooperate with a state attorney general's inquiry into an alleged death threat. Defense lawyers subsequently accused <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> of denying <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> a fair trial by attempting to intimidate defense witnesses. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, wrote a letter Monday to Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, a Democrat, demanding that <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> and two assistants be placed on leave. <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>, who supervises <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>'s department for Mofford, said the three would not be placed on leave pending an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation and another inquiry he is supervising. <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>, a private attorney on loan to Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> by his firm, acknowledged it might be inappropriate for him to continue supervising the internal investigation. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, elected as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, became acting governor when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeached <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and will become the permanent governor if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicts him or if she wins a multi-candidate May 17 recall election against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>, who only last Friday said that full disclosure of potential conflicts was vital for public confidence, acknowledged that publicity about his relationship with <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> could harm Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> politically. <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> came to him and law partner <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> LaSota </PERSON> after <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was elected in 1986. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was widely thought to be thinking of trying to fire <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> despite the state police chief's four-year contract, and <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> `` called us up and sought some legal advice,'' <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON> said. He declined to elaborate, citing attorney-client privilege, but said he believed that the bill, discounted to `` something like half-rates'' because <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> was a friend, came to less than $ 2,000 and probably less than $ 1,000. <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON> said he had not done any work for <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> in about six months, adding `` I do n't represent him now.'' <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON> said he stopped advising <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> before the events occurred that are at issue in the impeachment trial. But <PERSON> LaSota </PERSON> said in a separate interview he considered the relationship to be ongoing.

He plans to mail a log book and other papers to Guinness for official confirmation. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said he slept about 20 minutes during the 24 hours. Support from friends was essential. `` The last couple of hours, they were really cheering me on,'' he said Monday. `` I was just dogged tired and I'm not sure I would have made it without them.'' Bloom trained for months with a daily regimen of several thousand push-ups. In a practice session around Christmas, he did 16,000 push-ups in about seven hours, `` just to get a feel for it.'' Now he just feels sore. `` The best thing about it is when I woke up this morning, I did n't feel obligated to do my usual 1,000,'' he said.

 Colossus, a 502-pound ape reputed to be the largest lowland gorilla in captivity, was adjusting well to his new home in a private zoo after moving from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, his keepers said. `` He's doing wonderfully,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, director of The Zoo. `` He's eating well, vocalizing, a lot of chest pounding and stomping on his bed.'' The 20-year-old gorilla was moved Sunday night from <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, where he had been purchased from <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>'s Animal Park when it went out of business. The ape was flown on a DC-3 piloted by <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> of the `` Wild Kingdom'' television show to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> and then trucked to The Zoo on Monday. Moving pads were put around and inside Colossus' packing crate to keep him warm during the trip, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. He developed an attachment for the blankets, taking a pair with him to his new home in two adjoining cages, or bedrooms as <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> prefers to call them. `` He's got those blankets with him all the time,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said, adding that no one has volunteered to try to take them away. `` We do n't short sheet gorillas,'' he joked. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> hopes to breed Colossus with female gorillas, but the ape has n't seen another gorilla since he was captured in the wild as an infant. His first introduction will be by television. He enjoyed a television in his cage in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and zoo officials hope to install a TV and play videotapes for him in his new home, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said.

 One of the country's most wanted narcotics traffickers has been arrested and charged with importing 1,000 pounds of heroin into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> over a three-year period. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu-Leung </PERSON>, 44, who was arrested Sunday night outside a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> hotel, had been the Drug Enforcement Administration's No. 1 heroin target for about 2 -LCB- years, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>'s drug ring was much larger than well-known heroin cases operated by traditional organized crime groups, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. The `` French Connection'' case involved 70 pounds of heroin, the `` Pizza Connection'' about 200, he said at a news conference with <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> was believed responsible for bringing into the country twice the 1,000 pounds of heroin he was charged with importing. `` Clearly, the levels of heroin we're dealing with here are almost mind-boggling,'' said <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>. The heroin from <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>'s drug ring was smuggled into the country between 1984 and 1987 through various means, including suitcases and in shipments of vases, ice buckets, T-shirts and wall plaques, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. Couriers then carried millions of dollars in drug proceeds back to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to be laundered, authorities said. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> allegedly used $ 20 million to buy commercial real estate in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> sold the heroin to distributors at an estimated wholesale price of $ 100,000 per pound. Authorities estimate the street value of one pound of heroin at $ 1 million. Law enforcement authorities confiscated 570 of the 1,000 pounds alleged to have been imported by <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>'s organization in several seizures over the years, <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> first came to the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s attention in November 1984 when a shipment of 250 pounds of heroin, believed to be destined for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was seized in the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> harbor from a fishing trawler. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>, the alleged mastermind, eluded arrest by moving between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> had at least six phony passports and traveled under numerous fictitious names. She said <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>, who was born in mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and later moved to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> before becoming a fugitive, had numerous businesses in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including several fur companies and a firm called the <ORGANIZATION> Kon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He also allegedly had a watch manufacturing company in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said federal authorities lured <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after a federal grand jury indicted him. He declined to give any details concerning the circumstances of <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>'s arrest. Authorities also arrested <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Routollo </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> police officer, at his <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, home Sunday night. <PERSON> Routollo </PERSON>, 50, was charged with picking up the heroin, usually at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, for distribution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said that before <PERSON> Routollo </PERSON> left the force in 1981 he supplied weapons to <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>'s organization through his position in the police department's office of pistols and licenses.

 Would-be assassin <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> `` Squeaky'' <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> was convicted of escape after she told jurors she fled from prison because she thought her lover and mentor, mass murderer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, had cancer. A federal jury on Monday convicted <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> of the two-day escape from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Alderson </LOCATION>, where she is serving a life sentence for her 1975 attempt on then-President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s life. `` You do n't have any choice,'' she told the jurors while acting as her own attorney. `` I'm guilty as charged, legally, and without remorse morally, so that's that.'' The jury returned its verdict within 10 minutes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallanan </PERSON> set sentencing for April 28. <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON>, 39, faces five years in prison and $ 250,000 fine for the conviction. <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON>, who escaped Dec. 23 and was recaptured two miles away on Christmas Day, has been described as the main member of the <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> `` family.'' <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> is serving a life sentence in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the 1969 murders of actress <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and eight others. <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> told the jury Monday she attempted to escape because `` I got word that -LRB- <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> -RRB- had cancer. `` He needs a relative, somebody to check on him,'' she said of <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, whom she described as `` my husband, my brother, my father, my son, the man who's been my friend.'' She said she decided to escape because `` my access to him is so limited, I've been feeling helpless for years. `` If love means anything at all it means stop feeling helpless ... -LRB- and -RRB- take action if necessary.'' <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> called only herself as a witness. She carefully followed <PERSON> Hallanan </PERSON>'s instructions that her testimony had to be in the form of questions and answers. She questioned herself on the pronounciation of her name and cautioned: `` Miss Fromme, you talk too much,'' and `` Wait a minute, you're getting ahead of yourself.'' <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> also cross-examined the four prison employees called as government witnesses. Each indicated the institution _ which has an official capacity of 670 prisoners _ holds about 1,000 inmates. In her testimony, she told the jury the overcrowding was another reason she escaped. `` The prison has become more and more crowded, and the institution staff has become more and more tense,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was unharmed when a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent grabbed the semi-automatic pistol from <LOCATION> Fromme </LOCATION> on Sept. 5, 1975. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 17 days later, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> again escaped injury from would-be assassin <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who fired a revolver at him. She eventually pleaded guilty and received a life sentence. In 1979, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> also escaped from the <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> prison but was recaptured hours later. She is now at the federal prison in <LOCATION> Pleasanton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A former Methodist minister has decided not to contest a lawsuit by his mother-in-law accusing him of a near-fatal choking attack on his wife, saying legal fees would be too costly. `` He told me that he had decided his assets would be best used in the support and maintenance of his children,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON>, a defense attorney who represented <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> before a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury investigating the attack. <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> said the former minister decided not to contest the lawsuit because of estimates it would cost nearly $ 100,000 in legal fees. <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> called the lawsuit a `` publicity stunt,'' and said his client could win if he spent the money. The suit was filed by <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>, seeking an undetermined amount of damages in the April attack on her daughter, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, 39, never regained consciousness and remains in a coma in a Tyler nursing home. Mrs. <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, said Monday he will seek a default judgment but will ask for a jury trial to determine damages. `` The question now is, when do I want to go to court?' It could be tomorrow or it could be a couple of months. It depends on <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>'s best interests. I'm not going to run my schedule according to <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s schedule,'' <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s father-in-law said he was disappointed there was no response to the lawsuit. `` We thought he might come through and answer some of our questions. It sure would help, but it did n't turn out that way,'' he said in a Monday night telephone interview from his rural <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> home. `` It really is disappointing. I guess we're just going to have to keep waiting.'' Without a response, a judge could rule against the former senior minister of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> and award damages in his absence. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, 40, was not charged, but both his attorney and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinne </PERSON> identified him the prime suspect. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> refused to cooperate with police, denying his involvement and then invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 43 times when questioned by a grand jury. A psychologist, <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON>, reportedly told the grand jury that she and <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> were romantically involved and had discussed marriage before the attack. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> is living in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where he rented an apartment with Ms. <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> assigned his wife's guardianship to her mother, and that of his two children, ages 5 and 2, to family friends in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired four more long-range missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> today, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said civilians were killed when <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles crashed into residential areas of the city. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed its jet fighters `` heavily pounded'' Iraqi troop concentrations in southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> today, inflicting substantial casualties and losses. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not comment on the report. In another development, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> acknowledged at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday that it had failed to win support for a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for an end to the deadly missile duel. The Iraqi News Agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said four missiles were fired into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> today. It reported eight such missile strikes on Monday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said `` a number'' of civilians were killed in missile attacks on residential areas of the city overnight. It did not say how many rockets hit <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. On Monday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said missiles killed 26 civilians and wounded 50 in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also reported civilian casualties in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> but gave no figures. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says it has fired 13 missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> since the duel with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> resumed with a single rocket fired into the Iranian capital Sunday night after a two-day truce. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has fired two into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> since Sunday. Declaring an all-out offensive on <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> cities, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it launched air raids on `` military and economic targets'' in six western border towns Monday. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> also said Revolutionary Guards commandos pushed into northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to within 12 miles of the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Sulaimaniyeh </LOCATION> early Monday, seizing a dozen villages and killing or wounding 1,000 Iraqis. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also said its anti-aircraft gunners shot down an Iraqi fighter-bomber in the northeastern battles, while <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed its helicoptergunships downed an Iranian helicopter. An uneasy two-day truce that ended Sunday had brought a brief respite following a 12-day exchange of missiles, artillery fire and air raids by both sides that killed or wounded hundreds of civilians. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired 71 missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> and the central city of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, capital of ancient <LOCATION> Persia </LOCATION>, between Feb. 29 and March 11. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it shot 27 missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and two into the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION> in that period. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> acknowledged on Monday that the Soviet bid for a new resolution on the `` war of the cities'' had failed after the council met behind closed doors. `` Our personal preference would be a resolution of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>,'' but the important thing is `` not the form but the essence'' of the council's action, he told reporters after a closed-door council meeting. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> saw the proposal as a maneuver to deflect attention from the American push for a worldwide arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to punish it for refusing to honor the council's July 20 cease-fire resolution and peace plan. Instead of a new resolution, the council is expected to issue a statement later this week calling for an end to the missile attacks. A presidential statement is the mildest form of council action. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since 1980.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says an incursion of Mexican soldiers into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was an `` infringement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sovereignty,'' but <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials played down the incident as a harmless mistake. Mexican diplomats said the four members of the Mexican naval infantry, carrying automatic weapons, crossed the border without realizing it while in pursuit of alleged drug smugglers. The four were arrested without incident near the border and were released to Mexican military officials late Monday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol officials said no charges would be filed, but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the incident warranted further discussion between the two governments. `` This action is an infringement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territorial sovereignty,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` It's unacceptable regardless of their motivation or intention.'' `` I'm sure we'll take it up with the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government,'' he added. Mexican military or police have no authority to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when pursuing criminal suspects, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. `` The international line is marked clearly.

The four men were arrested late Sunday night after a Border Patrol helicopter crew spotted them talking with a group of revelers, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the armed men admitted they knew they were in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when they crossed the border. <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicley </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigation was complete and no charges would be filed. He would not say whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities accepted the soldiers' explanation that they were pursuing drug smugglers American authorities failed to locate the revelers to find out what happened during the encounter. <PERSON> Nicley </PERSON> said he did n't know what punishment the soldiers might face in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. American authorities described the soldiers as being equivalent in rank to privates. In a similar 1986 incident in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested seven Mexican judicial police agents who said they had accidentally strayed less than a mile into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> while on an anti-drug-smuggling assignment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials seized the stolen car the police officers were occupying, several automatic weapons, 6 grams of cocaine and $ 10,000 cash. Their commander said the officers probably did n't know the cocaine was in the car The seven were sent home after questioning and were not charged. On July 16, 1977, an altercation between <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> police and members of the a joint <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol-San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> police unit left two Mexican officers and one <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> policeman wounded. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police said the <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> officers were on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side of the border, but <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> police accused the Americans of firing across the border. A <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> officer was charged with assault with a deadly weapon.

<HEAD>Hearses Of IRA Guerrillas Attacked By Protestants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hearses carrying the bodies of three <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas home to <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> ran a gantlet of jeering, rock-throwing Protestants early today. Thousands of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> sympathizers waved black flags of mourning along the 100-mile Dublin-Belfast highway, mourning the three guerrillas who were shot by British troops while allegedly preparing a car-bomb attack in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. The March 6 killing of the unarmed guerrillas in the British colony sparked riots in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> for much of the following week. In another development, an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gunman and a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> civilian were reportedly shot and killed in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on Monday night and early today. The nine-hour procession for the slain <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas was marked by a confrontation at the border over <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> flags on the coffins and accusations by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s political wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, that police tried to break up the cortege and twice crashed a vehicle into one of the hearses. Crowds of Protestants waving <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> flags threw rocks and other objects at the procession on at least six occasions as it traveled by road the 40 miles from the border town of <LOCATION> Carrickaron </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said police deliberately slowed the cortege where Protestants had gathered `` to allow them to throw stones and jeer.'' Police denied the accusation, saying their concern was to ensure security. A few hours before the cortege arrived in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, police said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldiers shot a gunman who fired on an army patrol near the home of one of the dead guerrillas. The man, identified by police as <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, 33, died shortly afterward in the hospital. A police statement said <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> was jailed in 1978 for membership in the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, illegal possession of guns and criminal damage and was released on parole in 1985. An unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> was shot today at point-blank range from a motorcycle as he arrived for work at a south <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> store, police said. No group claimed responsibility. In <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, police said they were investigating a suspected letter bomb blast overnight at the city's central mail sorting office which blew a hole in the wooden floor and slightly injured two postal workers. News reports that the package was addressed to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> were dismissed as speculation by detectives. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said its members fired a volley over a makeshift shrine in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> as a farewell salute to <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24; and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30, who died in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. The traditional paramilitary salute, which is banned in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> as an illegal display of firearms, was fired Monday afternoon as the bodies landed in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement issued through <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>. The Royal <PERSON> Ulster </PERSON> <PERSON> Constabulary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force, promised in newspaper advertisements not to interfere with the funerals if the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> did not mount a gunfire salute over the coffins. The funerals are expected to take place on Wednesday in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, with burial in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milltown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> alongside many other <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas killed in nearly 20 years of political and sectarian strife in the province. The coffins arrived in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> on a plane chartered by <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> to a reception by about 1,000 supporters. The slow procession to the border, with thousands lining the route, was uneventful. At the border, two senior <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> officers demanded the removal of the Irish tricolors draped on each coffin. The tricolor, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s national flag, is regarded by <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Protestants as a symbol of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s fight to drive <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> republic. After a 30-minute confrontation, a compromise was reached whereby the flags were folded, replaced on the coffins and covered with wreaths. At <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION>, fives miles inside <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, the hearses were paraded around the largely Catholic town for two hours in front of cheering <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters. On the outskirts of <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION>, crowds from a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> municipal housing project jeered, waved <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> flags and hurled bricks, bottles and stones at the cortege. Windows in some of the cars were broken by the missiles. Similar scenes repeated themselves along the road to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The coffins containing the bodies of the three guerrillas were taken into the homes of their families in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> wants his Soviet counterpart to cut production of tanks, artillery and heavy missiles to prove he is seriously pursuing a new defensive military doctrine. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, speaking to reporters today en route to a meeting in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> with Soviet counterpart <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, said that despite the extensive publicity surrounding the emerging <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> doctrine of `` reasonable sufficiency,'' he has seen `` absolutely no practical change.'' `` If anything, their military continues to grow. They continue to modernize,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told reporters aboard his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet. The plane refueled in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and then completed the flight to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was to attend a dinner with <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> tonight, and sit down Wednesday and Thursday for the first ever business session between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet defense secretaries. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and other Soviet officials have said they are moving toward a new doctrine with a defensive posture. But they have never acknowledged that their past doctrine embodied an offensive posture, and various Soviet commentators have offered different views on the meaning of `` reasonable sufficiency.'' `` That's a question, by the way, I intend to ask him,'' said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` I'm still not sure what it is.'' If <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> wants to demonstrate that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is moving from an offensive to a defensive doctrine, the Soviets should slack off in tank and artillery production and `` maybe'' desist from the SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missile that carries 10 nuclear warheads, said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` One of the most important indicators, I would think, would be tanks. But tanks continue to pour out,'' he said. `` So there is no indication at the other end of the pipeline that there has been any change.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side also wants to discuss so-called `` dangerous incidents'' such as a collision involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet warships off the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coast last month, and the fatal shooting by a Soviet soldier of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Maj. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> on March 24, 1985, in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` One idea I have is for them to apologize for Maj. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, which they still have n't done,'' said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration wants the Soviets to agree on broad guidelines to curtail such incidents. The Soviets last month rammed two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships as they passed through Soviet territorial waters in an exercise designed to assert the `` right of innocent passage'' from international waters on one side of the Crimean peninsula to the other. On a personal level, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he was `` looking forward'' to meeting <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>. The meeting, the first of its kind and perhaps the first in a series of high-level military consultations, `` is kind of an interesting idea,'' he said. `` He was ... mildly critical of ` glasnost' as applied to the military, which seems to be a bit at variance with the standard line,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, although generally supportive of the reform policies of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, has said the policy of glasnost, or greater openness, must be restricted in the armed forces. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, dwelling on the meaning of the emerging Soviet military doctrine, said that `` sufficiency is a word that has been around for a long time'' since the detente era of the 1970s. `` Sufficiency can mean anything you define it to be, as best I can tell,'' he said. `` The -LRB- Soviet -RRB- military is saying that sufficiency is sufficient to meet the threat ... and, ` Oh, by the way, you have to have sufficient offense so that if the other fellow attacks you, you can attack him all the way to the ocean.' `` That does n't sound to me like anything new. At the same time, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is saying that there is something new. `` Some -LRB- Soviet -RRB- academics are saying, ` Well, maybe this means we can rethink our military establishment and do the same thing with less.' So obviously there is some kind of debate going on.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the first Soviet leader to visit <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in eight years, today visited the grave of <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> president who once ruptured ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who began an official visit to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> on Monday, said he `` got off to a good start'' in important talks with Yugoslav leaders. He spoke with reporters before agreeing to a new declaration on Soviet-Yugoslav relations with <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Bosko </PERSON> <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON>. The document is expected to chart a new path for relations between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and this nation, which broke with the Soviet bloc in 1948. The declaration incorporates previous documents from the 1950s, when <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> mended relations with <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is the first Soviet leader to visit since <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> attended <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s funeral in 1980. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> later planted a tree in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>'s Park of Friendship, established in 1961 after the first conference of the non-aligned movement <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife joked and chatted with a group of children who gathered around the larch tree before posing for photographs. Asked how his visit was going, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the atmosphere was `` businesslike.'' He added: `` I think some of the things we are doing during this visit will be of great significance for our mutual relations.'' Monday's talks with <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> leaders produced `` deep understanding'' between the two sides and `` we felt that there is a need for joint action in the future,'' he said. `` We got off to a good start,'' he added. On Monday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said ethnic minorities that rioted in his country are raising longheld grievances, not challenging the Communist government. At least 32 people were killed in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> in fighting two weeks ago between Azeris and their Armenian neighbors, who have staged mass street protests in recent weeks. `` Show me the country in which there are no such problems. If you show me, I will travel there right away, without stopping in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on return from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters on Monday. In talks Monday with <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> leaders, the Soviets stressed that no Communist nation has an absolute model for building socialism, Soviet deputy foreign minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Loginov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> showed the Western politician's touch he has exhibited on previous trips abroad, stopping his motorcade Monday to shake hands with <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> residents and chatting at a photo session. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, a federation of six republics and two autonomous regions, has wide ethnic, linguistic and cultural differences among its own bickering minorities. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s assistant foreign minister, <PERSON> Ilija </PERSON> <PERSON> Djukic </PERSON>, said the nationalities problems was raised only briefly during Monday's talks. He quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying in a discussion of social problems that `` there are no problems that would be solved once and for all, that conditions change, that everything requires improvement ... including the question of nationalities.'' <PERSON> Djukic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Loginov </PERSON> told a news conference Monday that the first round of talks was frank but very cordial, and that the two sides agreed Soviet premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> at a future date. That visit is likely to focus on the problems plaguing the extensive trade between the two nations. Since the 1950s, when <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> lifted an economic blockade imposed on <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has become <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s biggest trading partner. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> delivers crude oil and other materials to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in exchange for manufactured goods, including shoes, clothes and technology. The recent drop in oil prices has led to an imbalance as the Soviets refused to increase quantities of crude oil exports. There has been speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.4 billion paper debt to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in trade may be compensated by the Soviets building a subway to free <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>'s traffic-clogged streets. <PERSON> Loginov </PERSON> said on Monday the Soviets are studying in detail the system of worker self-management <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> evolved under Tito, and will incorporate any relevant features in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s own program of Kremlin reforms. The system by which workers nominally run Yugoslav enterprises has looked increasingly frail in the 1980s, when triple-digit inflation, rising unemployment and a $ 20 billion debt have made the boom of the 1970s a distant memory.

<HEAD>Market Chain Settles Anti-Israel Boycott Charges Out of Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $ 995,000 in penalties to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to settle charges that the company cooperated with a long-standing Arab boycott against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It -LRB- the settlement -RRB- is equitable, and it indicated we take enforcement of the anti-boycott laws very seriously and will continue to vigorously enforce them,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedenberg </PERSON>, undersecretary of commerce for export administration. The settlement announced Monday was the largest of its kind, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. For more than 30 years, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries have boycotted Israeli goods and companies that do business with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law passed in 1977 forbids Americans to comply with the boycott. The department filed charges against three stores licensed by Oakland-based <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>, two in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. Commerce officials alleged the three stores refused to do business with companies on an anti-Israeli blacklist and store managers instructed suppliers and customers to avoid such business relations. <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> officials said the penalty, less than one-quarter of what the department originally sought, absolved the company of wrongdoing. `` The settlement terms clearly vindicate the position that <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>'s conduct in its dealings with licensees in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> did not merit the harsh penalties originally sought,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magowan </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. `` We agree with the purpose and the spirit of the anti-boycott laws,'' he said. Three years ago <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> was fined $ 323,000, the previous largest anti-boycott penalty.

<TEXT>
 Almost nine of 10 Americans with less than a high school education ca n't understand the instructions for the simplest tax form, and <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> forms in general require greater reading skill than the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, a study concludes. Even more reading ability is required to comprehend an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> notice of taxes owed, says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>, director of the tax-clinic program at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the taxpayer can not read the instructions, how can the government expect compliance?'' <PERSON> Childs </PERSON> asked Monday as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> took testimony about the maze of tax penalties that Americans may encounter. These penalties range from $ 1 for failing to file a statement on dividends paid, to 25 percent of the tax owed for failing to pay on time, to $ 10,000 for helping a corporation understate its tax liability. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> and <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy, pledged support for the subcommittee's investigation into whether the number of penalties should be reduced and enforcement changed. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., chairman of the subcommittee, vowed a change `` We've created some sort of a monster here,'' he said. He noted <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> statistics that in 1987, the agency assessed 27 million penalties totaling over $ 14 billion and waived 4 million totaling $ 4 billion. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> cited one business that underpaid employment taxes by 2 cents and was hit with a penalty for $ 400.29. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> noted that many of the levies were enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over the past seven years in an effort to increase compliance with the tax laws. `` A penalty system that operates based on the wrong principles may provide appropriate sanctions for some types of behavior and yet have an overall negative impact on taxpayer behavior because it is not perceived as fair,'' he said. <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON> rejected allegations that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is stiffening penalty enforcement primarily to raise revenue, rather than improve compliance. `` We certainly hope there's not any reaction ... by <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agents in the field ... that penalties should be used as means of raising revenue,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> study found that instructions for 1040EZ _ the simplest tax form _ require an 8.45 grade reading level, compared with a grade level of 7.1 for the Wall Street Journal. The study concluded that the penalty system is especially onerous for lower-income Americans because in many instances they are not even aware of the need to comply. Because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not given the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> sufficient guidance, said <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>, penalties often are applied to taxpayers who have neither the money to hire a lawyer or accountant nor knowledge of how the system works. `` The low-income taxpayer has about as much knowledge of how to obtain abatement of a penalty through problems resolution -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' `` consumer advocate'' -RRB- as he or she does of getting to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Childs </PERSON> `` Abuses by high-income taxpayers have brought about a plethora of new penalties. Unfortunately, the low-income taxpayer has been caught in this net.'' The university used a textbook-grading formula and statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> to gauge the reading skill required to understand instructions for filling out tax forms 1040 and 1040EZ, which generally are simpler than an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> notice of deficiency. Sufficient skills were possessed by: _ 19.8 percent of blacks _ 37 percent of Hispanics _ 11 percent of those with less than a high school education _ 22 percent of high school graduates _ 50.2 percent of those with less than two years of college _ 82.8 percent of those with at least two years of post-secondary education

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities today banned Palestinians from traveling between the occupied territories, and hundreds of people rioted after a nightly curfew on the 650,000 Arabs in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Hospital officials said troops shot dead one Arab and wounded five today during clashes on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported in the rioting in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said seven of 90 Arab polie officers had quit. They were the first such resignations in the disputed Israeli capital. Their action came after 500 Arab police in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> heeded a call by underground <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists to turn in their badges. On the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a general strike called for by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> got under way with transportation halted and Arab-owned stores closed. The travel ban between the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> represented an effort by the Israeli army to stem the growing campaign against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation inspired by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. An official of the military's <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the measure applied to traffic in both directions. He said exemptions would be issued for hardship cases. `` They are allowed to work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but they ca n't continue into <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> or vice versa. They would be turned back at a checkpoint,'' said the official, using the biblical terms for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` The policy is not to separate -LRB- the Palestinians -RRB-, but to make it more difficult for agitators to move and to help stop distribution of anti-Israeli pamphlets that cause incitement,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The ban was the most comprehensive travel restriction imposed since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the areas in the 1967 Middle East War. Under Israeli law, Palestinians are allowed into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to work but must have police authorization to spend the night. The Israeli military also said it would to take punitive actions against foreign and local journalists it believed had filed false reports about incidents in the occupied territories. Army officers declined to elaborate, saying a statement would be released later. Officials at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mukassad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said a 22-year-old Palestinian from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Ain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yabrud </LOCATION> was dead on arrival with a bullet wound to the jaw. The Arab-owned <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> identified the dead man as <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hweih </PERSON> and said he was shot during a demonstration in <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarir </PERSON>, 9 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. Troops also shot and wounded four Palestinians in <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, 16 miles west of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, officials at <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. The Press Service put the wounded at six and said two were women shot in the head. The army said it imposed a curfew on <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, thick black smoke from burning tires rose above several neighborhoods. At least three handcuffed Palestinians were detained by troops and sitting on the ground in the <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> police station. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the army imposed a 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. curfew over the entire coastal territory following the resignation of 300 Arab policemen. Soldiers at the <LOCATION> Erez </LOCATION> checkpoint, the main entrance leading into the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, turned back <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents during the curfew, which was imposed without advance notice. Journalists saw 15 to 20 cars turned back in the first hour. After the curfew was lifted for the day, soldiers fired tear gas at hundreds of Arabs who threw stones at an army administrative office in the <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported. Army officers said the nightly curfew, which forces Arabs to stay in their homes, would keep <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> agitators from entering the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and provoking demonstrations. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio today said 300 Arab police in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had also resigned. They joined 450 officers in the occupied lands who turned in their badges earlier following orders of PLO-inspired underground leaflets. The radio said that 40 officers who had handed in their resignations in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> continued working after local <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders asked them to stay on. About 850 Arab policemen work in the occupied territories. In response to months of PLO-backed unrest in the occupied lands, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stepped up economic sanctions. Shipment of gasoline and other fuel to service stations in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was banned as of Sunday. According to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> figures, at least 91 Palestinians have been killed since anti-Israeli rioting began Dec. 8.

<HEAD>Vietnam Investigating 29 Cases Possibly Involving Americans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it is investigating 29 cases that may involve Americans listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts said today upon returning from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Joint Casualty Resolution Center, made the announcement following four days of what he called `` positive and productive'' talks with Vietnamese officials. `` The Vietnamese told us they are investigating 29 instances where they have received information, material or remains,'' he said in a statement. `` But they said it will take at least three weeks for them to draw any conclusions from these investigations or to have remains to repatriate.'' He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team provided new information to the Vietnamese government, emphasizing cases mentioned by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential emissary and retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> during his mission to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> last August. <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> had asked the Vietnamese to accelerate progress on resolving 70 `` discrepancy cases,'' in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says there is strong evidence that Vietnamese officials know what happened to the missing men. The evidence includes photographs of the men taken after their capture. In all, nearly 1,800 Americans remain unaccounted for from the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which ended in April 1975 with a communist victory over the U.S.-backed South <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> government. Progress on the issue has been slow principally because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have diplomatic ties with the Vietnamese government. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team also visited a site near the major northern port of <LOCATION> Haiphong </LOCATION> where a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft had crashed. <LOCATION> Haiphong </LOCATION>, over which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes flew intense bombing runs during the war, is about 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. The team was composed of six experts from the center and the Army Central Identification Laboratory. The laboratory and the casualty resolution center, both based in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, are entrusted with resolving the fates of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s wartime missing. It was the fourth round of technical talks since <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> told <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> during his visit that it would end months of deadlock and resume cooperation on the MIA issue. For its part of the agreement, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has on four occasions sent medical teams into <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to study how war-disabled Vietnamese and other humanitarian cases could benefit from private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance. There is an embargo on official aid because of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has returned remains it believes are those of Americans three times since the <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> agreement. The last repatriation came on March 2, when it handed over 17 sets in a ceremony at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> along with reports on three other missing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers. It was the largest turnover in two years and the fourth largest since the end of the war.

The man finally left in a white Datsun. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said he resumed watching cartoons and about 10 minutes later heard more banging, this time at a dining room window. He saw two men climbing through the dining room window. The boy said he went into the bathroom to climb out the window, but saw the white Datsun was parked in the back yard. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> told police he went back to the hallway, peeked around the corner into the den and was spotted by one of the intruders as they were taking the VCR. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> then fired three rounds at the men, who dropped the VCR and fled. When police arrived, one of the dead men was found face down next to a woodpile in the back yard, approximately 50 to 75 feet from the house, while the second man was in the driver's seat of the white two-door Datsun. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>'s parents both work and his sister had gone to a school activity with plans to be home in about an hour, said <PERSON> Blackwood </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Ice Chunk Probably Killed Prince Charles' Friend, Pathologist Said</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A British army officer killed in an avalanche that nearly engulfed his friend, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, most likely died from a chunk of ice that crashed down a Swiss mountainside, an inquest was told today. Maj. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, a 34-year-old career army officer, died of a single blow to the head and probably was standing when he was struk, Dr. <PERSON> Esha </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarvesvaran </PERSON>, a pathologist, testified. The pathologist told <ORGANIZATION> Hammersmith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coroner </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that the blow fractured <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>'s skull and caused severe bleeding. He said the object that struck <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> probably was a lump of ice. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and others were skiing in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> on Thursday off of a main trail at <LOCATION> Klosters </LOCATION> when the avalanche broke loose. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and other members of the party skiied clear but <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> was caught in the avalanche. Another friend, <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer-Tomkinson </PERSON>, suffered broken legs and lung injuries. Coroner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, who presided over the inquest, said he wanted to dispel speculation that <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> suffocated in the snow. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> is to be cremated after a funeral Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Sandhurst </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> adjourned the inquest until an unspecified date while a Swiss examining magistrate completes his inquiries. `` If it proves necessary to seek further evidence, then that would be taken from those who can give the most helpful evidence,'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said, reading from a statement. `` That is the only consideration when one decides which witnesses one might call.'' He said nothing about whether <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, the 39-year-old heir to the British throne, might be summoned to testify.

Newspapers said about 60 passengers were believed to be on the bus, which was en route from the southern town of <LOCATION> Barisal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. They quoted witnesses as saying only seven people jumped or swam to safety after the accident Monday night. The Janata, a Bengali-language daily, said the bus' brakes apparently failed. It said the driver and two assistants were among the missing. A senior police official at <LOCATION> Madaripur </LOCATION> said in a telephone interview today that five bodies had been recovered. `` Some more bodies might have been trapped inside the bus,'' he added. The police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said rescue work was hampered by a lack of equipment. He said that the <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> fire department had been asked to rush cranes and other equipment to the scene.

 Three students accused of putting a foreign substance into a school official's coffee in an attempt to poison him have been expelled for the rest of the school year, school officials say. The school board took the action Monday after two of the students, girls in the seventh and ninth grades at <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, waived their right to hearings. The other student, a ninth-grade girl, had insisted on a closed hearing, which was held March 10 before a state hearing examiner. The examiner recommended that she be expelled, and the board accepted the recommendation. All three girls have been accused in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juvenile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> of conspiracy to commit murder. They're accused of putting a foreign substance into vice principal <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Espelien </PERSON>'s coffee cup on Feb. 25. <PERSON> Espelien </PERSON> said he became suspicious when he saw a `` brownish-tan substance'' floating at the top of the cup and had it sent to a medical lab for analysis. The substance put in the coffee has not been revealed. <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brynildson </PERSON> said the students are entitled to return to school next fall unless the expulsion is extended. Until then, the district is required to provide tutors.

 A Swiss oilman involved in a failed <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline plan says a friend of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> tried to bypass the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by attempting to get <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s help on the project. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> also said Monday he had been ready to give <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> a third of his profits from the $ 1 billion project in return for an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> promise not to bomb the pipeline to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, which would have passed near the Israeli border. Speaking in Hebrew on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television, <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> denied allegations he offered a bribe to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, then prime minister, in return for a promise not to attack the pipeline. The pipeline project was prompted by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> backed out of the project because it was not satisfied with security arrangements. On Sept. 19, 1985 <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> wrote a letter to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not bomb the pipeline, and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s friend, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, took charge of organizing meetings with officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> said. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> -RRB- apparently approached and told me: ` Look, if Mr. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> confirms the -LRB- assurances -RRB- to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, then we will arrange such a meeting, and it will go up to the president' and so on,'' <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> said. `` What I understand now is that the intention then was to bypass the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> said. He was not clear in the interview exactly what the meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were about. `` <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> understood that if we want to receive support for such a guarantee which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has no possibility or need to give ... and we had an alternative agreement with large insurance companies, with a group of bankers, with individuals, so if this had to pass through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> it would not come into being,'' he said. He said President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> feared for his life if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> bombed the pipeline and in meetings <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> demanded a $ 400 million guarantee no bombing would occur. <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> said he received the guarantee from the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-run export company, while <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was asked to provide `` a moral guarantee.'' At that stage, <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> said, he was introduced to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who organized a meeting with then-National <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> -RRB- was very excited to get all possible assistance for ... <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said. A memo by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> says that on Oct. 16, 1985, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had a `` three-way discussion'' of the project at the Israeli Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers, said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s account `` totally exaggerates'' the discussion. <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> said he was first told of the pipeline project in September 1984. He said he met in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who confirmed the Jewish state had no intention to bomb the pipeline. He said he also met with representatives of the San-Francisco based <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was to build the pipeline. <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> said he had been prepared to give <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> $ 60 million to $ 70 million a year, or a third of his profits from the project, over a 10-year period. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> wrote a memo to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> saying that of $ 65 million to $ 70 million a year over 10 years which <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> was going to funnel to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, some would go to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, although that would be `` denied everywhere.'' As a result, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is investigating in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> and others conspired to pay an illegal bribe to a foreign official _ that is, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and his party. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is trying to determine if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was simply passing a problem on to the appropriate official _ as <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers say _ when he referred <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> in May 1985, or if he was aiding a conspiracy to get funds for the guarantee despite opposition from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Whatever he heard from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> endorsed the idea and assigned an aide to work on it while keeping progress of the proposal secret from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Proposal Dropped by Superintendent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Public school Superintendent <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> abruptly withdrew a districtwide plan for year-round schools by July 1989, conceding there was n't enough support from the school board. `` Frankly, it is very late to place the entire school district on a new calendar in July 1989,'' <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> said Monday, just before the seven-member board was to vote on the proposal. The board earlier had agreed to the July 1989 date, but tabled it last October after a fiery public outcry. The district adopted a policy two years ago phasing in year-round schooling for all students by the 1991-92 school year. Those in favor of the proposal said it would ease overcrowding by putting some students in classes during the usually idle summer months. They also said it would provide educational advantages such as better retention of information. Currently about one-quarter of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Unified School District students, those in the most crowded schools, are on year-round schedules. Proponents say the selective policy is unfair, especially to the minorities who account for most of the student population. Critics say year-round schools disrupt family vacations and students' summer jobs, make child care more difficult and force some students to spend summer days in hot, antiquated rooms. <PERSON> Britten </PERSON> said the district will still aim for a year-round schedule, but he admitted a majority of the current seven-member school board may never agree.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> peace talks reached a Soviet-set target date today but the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator, citing difficult issues still to be resolved, said negotiations will continue. `` We are discussing very serious, difficult issues but we continue to negotiate and look for solutions,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said that if an agreement was reached by March 15, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s estimated 115,000 troops would start leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by mid-May. Neither side in the negotiations, which resumed today, has said the deadline was a rigid one or that the Soviets would consider going back on their pledge to withdraw their troops if the deadline passed without an agreement. But in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today, the Soviets said failure to meet the deadline will delay the start of a Soviet troop withdrawal. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said there was only a `` slim'' chance the accords could be signed by the end of the day. He blamed the situation on <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s insistence that a coalition government be formed in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> before the agreement was reached. He accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of `` procrastination'' in the negotiations in an attempt to arrange a post-war government to its liking. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has said it wants a transitional government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> before the Soviets begin their withdrawal to oversee the Soviet pullout and ensure the safe return of more than 5 million refugees from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> say <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> should decide the makeup of its future government after the settlement is signed. The current round of talks, now three weeks old, has completed all main elements of the settlement aimed at ending nine years of fighting. Those elements include the timetable and basic logistics of the pullout of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops, an issue that has eluded a solution for several years. Sources close to the talks, who declined to be identified, said on Monday the Pakistanis also have reservations about some minor points in the complex agreement package. The sources said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> received a new <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> message during the weekend, urging it to sign the settlement without delay. Unconfirmed reports quoted <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> as saying that a decision on whether it would sign would be announced Monday. But there was no official word by nightfall. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s Cabinet has held three meetings since Sunday, apparently to weigh its next step. Meanwhile, the fragile seven-party <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas failed to decide whether it would drop its demand to dominate a future Afghan government. A guerrilla leader said on Monday in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> again rejected direct talks with the Moslem rebels on the Afghan issue. The resistance is represented by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks but its position has not always been identical with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s. The guerrillas have started to form a government of their own which <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> considers too hard-line. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began sending troops to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 at the request of the pro-Moscow government. The Soviet troops and the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government's regular army of about 50,000 men are pitted against 200,000 Moslem rebels, supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> today buried Premier <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> <PERSON> Hung </PERSON> after eulogizing him as a dedicated revolutionary who defied torture and harsh battlefields in a 60-year struggle for the communist cause. Guerrillas fighting <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s nine-year occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> called Hung `` a notorious murderer'' who brought widespread suffering to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Hung, who played a key role in defeating the U.S.-backed South <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> government and rose to the No. 2 position in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy, was buried in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> after dying of a heart attack last Thursday. He was 75. Vietnamese radio reports said Communist party chief <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> and other top party officials carried <PERSON> Hung </PERSON>'s casket from the <ORGANIZATION> Ba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dinh </ORGANIZATION> conference hall to a gun carriage for the trip to <LOCATION> Mai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dich </LOCATION> cemetery, the final resting place of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s revolutionary leaders. Tens of thousands of mourners lined the six-mile route of the carriage, flanked by two rows of armed military honor guards, said the reports monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The radio of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the main anti-Vietnamese guerrilla group, said <PERSON> Hung </PERSON> died `` as one who brought endless misery and suffering on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and on the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples.'' The broadcast, a text of which was seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today, said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s leaders should rethink the line adopted by Hung and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Duan </PERSON>, who died in July 1986. Hung died while Vietnamese forces were `` almost choking to death from their attempt to swallow <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' the broadcast on Sunday said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s economy has `` hit rock bottom,'' and the country is internationally isolated, it said. <PERSON> Vo </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiet </PERSON>, a vice premier and head of state economic planning, has been chosen acting premier to replace Hung. <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiet </PERSON> are regarded by Western analysts as the country's leading proponents of Western-style reforms which the party has deemed crucial to overcome the nation's economic crisis

 Convicted murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, who maintained his innocence through 14 years on death row and became the focus of an international debate on capital punishment, was executed today in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s electric chair. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, 54, was convicted of fatally shooting <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> while robbing his wife of $ 15 in September 1973. `` I was not guilty for the charge for which I was arrested and this morning I tell you I am not guilty of the charge for which I am about to be executed,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said in a final statement to 30 witnesses in the death chamber. `` I go this morning with a clear conscience. I bear no guilt. I'm at peace with myself, with the world, with each of you. God bless you.'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> winked and nodded at one of his attorneys just before the hood was put over his head, and was declared dead at 7:12 a.m. after 2,000 volts of electricity flowed through his body for two minutes. Two puffs of smoke rose from his right leg where one of the electrodes was attached. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s case attracted worldwide attention, including pleas for clemency Nobel peace prize winner <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and other human rights activists. They said <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> was railroaded because he was black and the victim was white. Earlier today, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> was executed in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s electric chair for the 1978 murder of a policeman It was the first time two inmates were executed the same day in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since Aug. 28, when three murderers were put to death, in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> spent 14 years on death row, one month less than <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who has been on death row in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since December 1973. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> refused his last meal this morning, said prison spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Macmaster </PERSON>. By 6 a.m., <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> had showered, and his head and lower right leg were shaved to facilitate the flow of electricity, the spokesman said. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, a federal judge and the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s appeals. His last hope was a reprieve from Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who signed <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s seventh black-bordered death warrant last week and said Monday he had no plans to issue a stay. `` I think of the victim at a moment like this and the family which was destroyed,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` A hideous murder took place and that's what I keep in mind. Just because it's 15 years later, that does n't reduce a crime that was committed at the time.'' `` The governor's hands are now stained with the blood of a man from whom justice was withheld,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Healey </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Early today, about 40 people gathered in a cow pasture across from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison to protest the execution. The opponents maintained silence after 7 a.m. while the execution took place, then began singing `` We Shall Overcome.'' `` I think it's long overdue. He did it to himself. I'm just thinking right now I want some peace of mind ... it's been a long time and I'm glad it's finally over,'' said <PERSON> Turman </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, minutes after the execution. Mrs. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> has remarried since the shooting. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> went into <PERSON> Turman </PERSON>'s furniture store on September 8, 1973, and had just robbed <PERSON> Turman </PERSON>'s wife of $ 15 when <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> came on the scene. Court records say that after shooting <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> between the eyes, <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> unbuckled his belt and unzipped his pants and ordered his wife to get on the floor, remove her false teeth and perform oral sex on him while <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> lay dying just a few feet away. A neighbor, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, also identified <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> during the trial. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, then 16, entered the store after apparently hearing the shooting and the woman's cries. He was shot three times but survived. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> became the 18th person executed in the state and the 96th executed in the nation since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> restored capital punishment in 1976. Death penalty opponents, led by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, have said <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> had an alibi to prove his innocence. They claim there is evidence _ statements from a minister and a woman _ that <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> could not have committed the murder. In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, about a dozen people demonstrated Monday outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, urging <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to commute <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s death sentence. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> rejected appeals on <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s behalf by <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, actress <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, through Florida-based Roman Catholic leaders, has expressed concerns in the past about <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> death cases, but never <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s specifically <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> for the <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> killing said Friday, `` There is no question he is guilty.''

<TEXT>
 At least four people were killed and more than 90 injured today during an opposition-sponsored strike to demand the resignation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. The strike closed offices and businesses in six of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s states but failed to achieve widespread support in the other 17 states At least three people were killed and several others were hurt in street clashes in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. Violence also was reported in neighboring <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state, where at least 75 people were reported injured. In <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION> state, the news agency reported a youth was killed and seven other people injured when a flour mill operator opened fire at opposition party supporters attacking his mill near the coastal city of <LOCATION> Ernakulam </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> also said 14 police were injured near the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border in <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> state when they were pelted with stones while trying to remove roadblocks. The strike disrupted normal life in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s business center, and in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, the country's largest city. But it drew little response in the capital at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, where most businesses remained open. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said police arrested at least 3,000 people from various cities for attempting to block traffic and close shops. But the opposition coalition that called the strike said at least 150,000 people were arrested. In a statement in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the eight parties maintained the strike was complete in all major towns and industrial areas. The strike was called by most major opposition parties to protest sectarian violence, rising prices and alleged corruption in government. The parties, which include two communist groups, demand that <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> be dissolved and new elections held. In Parliament, proceedings were disrupted for more than an hour when opposition members raised anti-government slogans in the upper house. Earlier, the entire opposition boycotted the first hour of business in both houses in support of the strike. On Monday, at least 25,000 people were arrested in the southern state of <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> and 500 others in <LOCATION> Orissa </LOCATION> in the east in what police said was a move to pre-empt violence during today's strike. Opposition members in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> today criticized the government for Monday's arrests, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds more than 400 of the 542 seats in the popularly elected lower house of Parliament. The rest are divided among opposition parties which have failed to act jointly despite common demands that <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> resign.

<TEXT>
 A grand jury has indicted Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedo </PERSON> on 23 charges including theft, falsifying expense records and attempting to obstruct the state auditor. The indictment, made public Monday after the mayor's arraignment in <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, included 22 felony charges. Fedo, 37, said the charges were a political ploy arranged by people who do n't like him. The indictment, he said, `` is not going to have an effect on City Hall.'' If convicted, <PERSON> Fedo </PERSON>, 37, faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on the theft charge and up to five years in prison on most of the other charges. <PERSON> Fedo </PERSON> was freed on his own recognizance and scheduled to appear in court May 3, when a judge will determine whether enough evidence exists to proceed to trial. His lawyer, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauter </PERSON>, said he will move for dismissal of the charges. <PERSON> Fedo </PERSON> was `` tried once in the election and found not guilty,'' he said. Fedo, a member of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic-Farmer-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, won his first four-year term as mayor in 1979 and has been re-elected twice. The theft charge concerns $ 13,500 given to Fedo by three businessmen to lobby for state funds for a convention center in the city. During the 1987 election campaign, <PERSON> Fedo </PERSON> said he passed the funds to an unnamed Twin Cities businessman in 1985 in exchange for information about other cities' convention center proposals. But prosecutors say the mayor played a limited role in lobbying for a convention center he later claimed to have won almost single-handedly. <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, a city of 85,000 on the western tip of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION>, was never in competition for the $ 200 million convention center for which <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> vied, the charges say. The State Legislature awarded <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> a total of $ 17.2 million for its own, relatively small center.

 Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> wrote in an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> newspaper today that television cameras should be barred from the occupied territories. In a signed column published in the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said that in view of what is happening elsewhere in the world, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be justified in taking steps to bar TV crews from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` Many other nations throughout the world are experiencing troubles similar to those now taking place in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Should <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> be the only nation to allow full television coverage of these troubles? `` This creates a false impression in the minds of television viewers that such events are happening only in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' wrote <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, a longtime supporter of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. More than 90 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire and beatings in riots that started Dec. 8 in the territories occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. The territories are home to 1.5 million Palestinians. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he thought <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should use whatever force necessary to put down the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands. The mayor also criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> editorial writers and columnists for their `` relentless drumbeat of criticism against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' He added that he had attacked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the Vietnam War but now had `` second thoughts'' about the wisdom of deserting South Vietnamese allies. `` It's easy for columnists, and for all of us, to play God with the lives of other people, endanger them and leave them ultimately to be destroyed,'' he wrote.

 Passengers spent longer than they bargained for today in the world's longest undersea tunnel, which opened to trains two days earlier. A power outage left them stranded for more than three hours 460 feet underground in the 37-mile-long Seikan Tunnel. The tunnel links <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest island, <LOCATION> Honshu </LOCATION>, with Hokkaido, the northernmost main island. It cuts two hours off a trip formerly made by ferry. It took 24 years to build at an estimated cost of $ 8.5 billion. Most of the 166 passengers were asleep when the outage halted their 11-coach express train, bound for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION>, about 12 miles from the tunnel's south exit. A locomotive pulled the train from the tunnel, and it resumed its journey from the next station, at <LOCATION> Aomori </LOCATION>, 3 hours and 50 minutes behind schedule, a <ORGANIZATION> Hokkaido </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The cause of the power outage was under investigation, said the Hokkaido representative, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Six trains have been stopped by faulty fire detectors since the tunnel opened.

<TEXT>
 More than 50 independent production companies, including <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s talk show, are seeking exemptions from striking scriptwriters, union officials say. That would allow some companies to work during the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> strike against the 200-member <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>. No talks were scheduled in the 10-day-old strike by 9,000 Guild members. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> executive director of the guild, said its board would consider appeals for an interim agreement with several companies. <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the writers, said decisions on exemptions would probably be announced Wednesday or Thursday. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> declined to identify those seeking interim agreements, but `` The Tonight Show'' announced through its publicists that it was among them. A spokesman for the producers belittled the union's assertion about the number of independents seeking waivers. `` The overwhelming number of independents are actually a writer that employs himself for tax purposes. He produces nothing,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. `` With the exception of <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, I do n't know of any other independent producer looking to make a deal who is also member of the alliance.'' Among shows already rejected for a waiver or interim contract was the Academy Awards, scheduled for broadcast on April 11. Lobell-Bergman Productions disclosed Monday that the strike has affected development of five of eight movies on its slate and stopped work on a network comedy series. Previously postponed was a revival of `` The <ORGANIZATION> Smothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hour </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` The Dictator,'' a new series starring <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. The guild is seeking an increase in creative control, an increase in residuals from foreign market distribution, and rejection of a producers' contention that residuals for hour-long syndicated television shows should be adjusted.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has released a new report sharply criticizing quality control procedures at <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes drugs to fight symptoms of AIDS and other diseases. An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday a re-inspection of <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION>'s main manufacturing plant found the same sort of problems that led the agency to take disciplinary action against the suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> company last fall. <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it intends to respond to the latest inspection report later this week. `` We are committed to ensuring that our quality meets and exceeds the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> standards,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapoor </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> gained national prominence for its sales of pentamidine, a drug used to fight a form of pneumonia that frequently kills people with AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In November, the federal agency warned <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> it could be taken to court if `` serious violations'' of <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> regulations were not corrected, and it suspended approval of the company's applications to market new drugs The latest <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> report listed 44 violations of `` good manufacturing practices'' found during a three-month inspection. Violations cited included shipping products that had failed some sterility tests, changing the manufacturing process for several drugs without knowing the effect of the changes, distributing drugs without proper <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval, and other quality control problems. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a compliance officer at the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> district, said the problems were the same type of violations as cited last fall, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. `` The severity and degree of the violations is yet to be determined,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it had appointed a new director of quality control and a new director of regulatory affairs since November. The discovery of new or continuing violations does n't necessarily mean the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> will continue its suspension of work processing <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION>'s applications to market new drugs, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said `` It depends on how significant the deviations would be and what they have done to correct them,'' he said. A former <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> employee, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, filed a lawsuit earlier this month claiming the company had fired him because he refused to release drugs that had failed quality tests. <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> has said he was fired for `` performance reasons.''

<HEAD>10,000 March In Protest Through Budapest Streets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 About 10,000 protesters marched through the streets of this Communist capital today calling for democracy and freedom of the press. Dozens of police patrols passed by, but authorities made no attempt to hinder the unofficial protest, which came on the anniversary of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s aborted 1848 revolution against <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Protesters carried signs that read `` We Want Democracy'' and `` We Want Freedom of the Press'' and chanted anti-government slogans. Groups of demonstrators whistled and applauded when police vehicles passed by, but authorities refused to act on what appeared to be attempts to provoke them. The protesters blocked traffic and attracted large groups of passers-by, some of whom joined the throng as it meandered through central <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. Dissident sources said four prominent activists were detained in advance of the unofficial protest. The sources earlier report three activists had been taken into custody. Communist party authorities, meanwhile, held an official rally to mark the anniversary on the steps of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s national museum, where the 1848 revolution broke out. Communist party officials laid wreaths and made speeches calling for greater national unity and economic progress. Hungarian dissidents have marked the anniversay by staging unofficial rallies on March 15 since 1973, and have met with varying reactions from authorities. Last year, police allowed thousands of people to march through downtown <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, calling for democracy as part of one of the biggest unofficial protests here in years. But in 1986, police clashed with protesters on March 15, and broke up that year's unofficial demonstration. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has won a reputation as a relatively liberal Soviet bloc country, although far less dissent is tolerated than in Western countries. One dissident source identified three of the activists detained this morning as writer <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tamas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlynar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Demszky </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s biggest underground publisher. The source, who asked not to be named, said two other activists _ <PERSON> Ottilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Solt </PERSON> and writer <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gado </PERSON> _ may also have been taken into custody. He said friends were unable to reach them early today. Sources speculated the activists were detained to warn dissidents away from the unofficial protest, and predicted they would be relased later today. Police have raided the homes of at least eight dissidents during the past two weeks, including <PERSON> Gado </PERSON>, <PERSON> Solt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Demszky </PERSON>, sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. During the police search, hundreds of copies of unofficial journals, political documents and books were confiscated, <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON> said.

 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today `` we're going to have a good day,'' casting his ballot as the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> presidential primary began with a light turnout in cold weather. On the Republican side, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wondered aloud what was keeping rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the race. `` I'm not sure I understand what he's doing,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during a final campaign swing in the state where polls were forecasting a landslide victory for the vice president over his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rivals. But both <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> were insisting they were staying in the race, though the former television evangelist said he would re-evaluate his status if he gets less than 5 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> voted at <ORGANIZATION> Bryn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mawr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on the city's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. `` We've been winning all the way and we'll keep winning,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the victor last Saturday in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and winner of five states on Super Tuesday. The state's other Democratic favorite son, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, voted at the Makanda Fire Station in rural southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. After casting their ballots, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and his wife went to their home and planted a tree in their yard, an election-day tradition. Between 2.5 million and 3 million voters were expected to turn out for the primary on a wintry day. <PERSON> Kel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, associate director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION>, said that would represent 46 percent to 48 percent of the registered voters. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> does not have party registration so voters could choose a Democratic or Republican ballot at their polling place. Initial reports from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> precincts were of a light turnout. Precinct captain <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Smar </PERSON> said that during the first hour and a half his polling place was open, only 15 of the 498 registered voters had cast ballots, nearly all of them Democrats. `` It's more quiet than normal for this type of election,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, spokesman for the city election commission. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> voters express their presidential preference in a non-binding beauty contest and also elect convention delegates. It was possible a candidate would do well in the popular vote, but lose out in the contest for delegates to a contender who had stronger slates filed in the state's 22 congressional districts. As if to emphasize his determination to fight on, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> to campaign in two of the states that follow <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said, `` I will win'' his home state's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary, and conceded second place in either the popular vote or the delegate contest would not be good enough. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he has made `` significant gains'' in his effort to finish ahead of at least one of the state's two favorite-son candidates. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll done Saturday and Sunday suggested <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had the support of 39 percent of 328 likely Democratic voters, with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 34 percent. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s lead was within the poll's 6-point margin of error. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trailed with 17 percent. At stake in today's voting were 82 <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and 113 Democratic delegates. Another 10 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates will be chosen at the party state convention in June. Sixty additional Democratic delegates will be allocated to candidates in the same proportion as they won delegates in the primary and 15 more elected and party officials will become super delegates to the Democratic convention. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 705, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 165 and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 17 GOP convention delegates, out of the 1,139 needed for the nomination. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 462.5, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 423.55, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 352.8, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 145 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 35.5. There are 275.65 uncommitted Democratic delegates. Democratic Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> suggested Monday he would try to rally uncommitted delegates behind whichever candidate leads the field when the primaries have ended, if none has yet secured a numerical lock on the nomination. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said Monday that the party leaders and other officials who automatically hold seats as national convention delegates have a `` special responsibility'' to help ensure that the nominating process does not turn into a political fight that damages the nominee. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in the aftermath of his Super Tuesday sweep of 16 primaries, saw <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> as a chance to take another giant step toward clinching the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> hoped the return to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> would blunt the vice president's momentum. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> saw his home state primary as an opportunity to challenge <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the leadership of the Democratic field. For <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was a fight for survival, while Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> was looking for `` an opportunity to punch through'' with a victory in a Northern industrial state. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> did little campaigning in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, concentrating instead on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which holds Democratic caucuses on March 26. A poll published Sunday in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a 34-point lead over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> among Illinois Republicans, with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> a distant third. Yet, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator insisted he had no plans to even consider dropping out if he does poorly in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` I've made a judgment that <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, whatever happens, we're going to keep going,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said at a news conference on Monday But he conceded candidates sometimes fail to understand when it is time to get out. `` Now if you're out there and you've been twisting in the wind for six or eight months and you're starting to smell a little, somebody has to cut the rope,'' he said.

 Jury selection began today for the trial of the first of 23 people charged with physically or sexually abusing their children or young relatives, but there were fears that impartial jurors might be in short supply. <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Back </PERSON>, 33, sat hunched over in her chair, clutching her purse, when <ORGANIZATION> Magoffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> called the court to order. She is accused of using lighted cigarettes to torture her three boys, ages 5, 8 and 10. Ms. Back, of the mountain hollow community of <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>, is charged with three counts of first-degree criminal abuse. She was not charged with sexual abuse. Five trials have been scheduled through mid-June in this eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> coal mining county for 12 of the defendants, and the remaining cases could come to trial later this year. `` It is difficult to get an impartial jury for any trial in <LOCATION> Magoffin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' said Deputy Judge-Executive <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Salyer </PERSON>, the county's top appointed administrator. `` People have a lot of connections, both politically and otherwise.'' The investigation began when state social workers asked <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> state police for help on a complaint of suspected child abuse in 1986. The social workers say they can not reveal details on the cases. Indictments were returned by a county grand jury that was shown videotaped interviews with six children. The indictments were accompanied by hand-written notes from some of the children describing acts of sodomy and abuse among family members. Two members of the state attorney general's staff began handling the case last August after a local prosecutor withdrew. The state prosecutors unsuccessfully sought in October to have the trials moved, claiming the defendants were members of `` five large, extended families'' that had too many friends and political allies in the <LOCATION> Appalachian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> county of about 14,000 people. Many of the defendants share the family name <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON>. The prosecutors cited a courthouse demonstration in support of the defendants in November 1986 and a series of sympathetic letters to the editor of a local newspaper. Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said he would try to find an impartial jury without moving the trial. He said he expected the case to last three or four days, and was not sure if he would let the children testify on videotape or in person in a state where cameras are allowed in courtrooms. Dr. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> dermatologist, wrote in a pretrial report that Ms. <PERSON> Back </PERSON>'s three sons had numerous scars on their faces, arms, backs and legs that `` suggest having been burned with a cigarette or similar sized burning object.'' The doctor reported that two of the boys told him their mother was responsible for the scars. The children, and others in the county ranging from age 1 to 11 who were alleged victims of incest, rape, sodomy, sexual abuse, physical abuse and assault, all have been placed in foster homes. Customers at the Coffee Cup restaurant, across the street from the courthouse, said Monday the trials are bound to bring bad publicity to a county that already has received more than its share. But <LOCATION> Magoffin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> should n't be viewed as a hotbed of physical and sexual abuse against children, maintained <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>, one of the customers. `` You see it in the papers every day all over the country,'' <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>, business manager of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salyersville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> and a distant relative of <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>, agreed. `` This goes on everywhere but it just seems to fit into the stereotypical view of people here,'' in the mountains, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> said. `` But that stereotype just is n't true.'' Widespread vote-buying in the county was the focus of an article in the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> Herald-Leader and a series of stories on election fraud in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> Courier-Journal last fall. Government services in the county also were shut down for five weeks last summer when the Fiscal Court, the governing body, could not reach agreement on an annual budget.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired six missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> today and its air force bombed other Iranian cities. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it pounded southern Iraqi towns with shells, short-range rockets and warplane raids. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said civilians were killed in Iraqi missile attacks and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Iranian shelling killed nine civilians in the city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> acknowledged it failed to win support for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for an end to the deadly missile duel in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war The U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Gas Prince was sailing up the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in the 17th convoy conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> this year. The Iraqi News Agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said six missiles were fired into the Iranian capital today. It reported eight such missiles strikes Monday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said `` a number'' of civilians were killed in missile attacks on residential areas of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> overnight. It did not say how many rockets hit the city. On Monday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said missiles killed 26 civilians and wounded 50 in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also reported civilian casualties in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> but gave no figures. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says it has fired 15 missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> since the duel resumed with a single rocket fired into the Iranian capital Sunday night after a two-day truce. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has fired two into <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The Iraqi agency said warplanes pounded the western Iranian cities of Dezful, <LOCATION> Kermanshah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hamadan </LOCATION> today in `` destructive'' raids. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said sores of civilians were killed. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its artillery shelled <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> province, whose capital is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, and fired 11 short-range rockets into the region. The Iraqi agency quoted its correspondent in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> as saying nine civilians were killed and 10 wounded. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said Iranian warplanes bombed <LOCATION> Al-Amarah </LOCATION>, about halfway between <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, and the northeastern town of <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that Revolutionary Guards commandos pushed to within 12 miles of <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION>. It said the Iranians seized a dozen peaks and several villages, killing or wounding 1,000 Iraqis. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the latest round of missile attacks was a reprisal for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s shelling of Iraqi border towns Sunday night in which at least 21 civilians were killed and 80 wounded. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> earlier charged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> broke a Friday cease-fire by launching ground attacks and bombarding Iraqi towns. An uneasy two-day truce brought a brief respite after 12 days in which both sides fired dozens of missiles and artillery fire and launched air raids that killed or wounded hundreds of civilians. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> acknowledged Monday that the Soviet bid for a new resolution on the `` war of the cities'' had failed after the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> met behind closed doors. `` Our personal preference would be a resolution of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, but the important thing is `` not the form but the essence'' of the council's action. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> saw the proposal as a maneuver designed to deflect attention from the American push for a worldwide arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to punish it for refusing to honor the council's July 20 cease-fire resolution and peace plan. Instead of a new resolution, the council is expected to issue a statement later this week calling for an end to the missile attacks. The 46,723-ton Gas Prince, a liquefied-gas carrier was sighted off <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> at midday. It was escorted by the missile frigate <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, witnesses reported. The convoy was the 39th since July, when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> began escorting 11 Kuwaiti tankers, re-registered under the American flag, to protect them from Iranian attack. There have been no direct attacks on any of the vessels since the escort operations began.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Riot police using tear gas, shotguns and a water cannon today broke up a demonstration by unpaid public employees as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military government announced it would begin partial salary payments to thousands of government workers. More than 500 employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s main hospital in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> blocked a divided highway this morning before three units of riot police dispersed them `` Fewer guns, more medicine,'' the workers chanted. A nurse, who declined to give her name for fear of reprisals, said the hospital's 9,000 employees had been given no explanation by supervisors of when or how they would be paid. Reporters saw five or six people brought to the hospital with minor injuries from birdshot fired by police during the melee, which tied up traffic for more than two hours. The facility was offering only emergency services. The presidential press office said the partial payments would be made on a sliding scale that would give full wages to more than half of the public servants, with others receiving a percentage of their salaries. The action came a day after sporadic violence broke out in the capital and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> port city of Colon, the nation's second largest, after word spread that public employees would not be paid this week. Directors of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Servants </ORGANIZATION>, which represents nearly all government employees, said they would reject the government plan and demand full wages. In another development, the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government asked <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> here, to leave the country within 48 hours, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> source said. The government did not explain the expulsion, but <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, a leading embassy spokesman, has formally responded to several government accusations in the past week, including a formal charge that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was preparing to invade <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. His response to that allegation was that it was `` ridiculous.'' Some teachers, telephone and dock workers struck Monday to demand their wages and police put down a demonstration in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with tear gas and rubber truncheons. Protesters lit fires in the streets of the capital and chanted `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go'' _ a reference to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military strongman, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The government provided no other details about its partial payment plan, but sources said the plan would provide full wages to employees making less than $ 30 every two weeks, while others would get a percent of their salaries. On Monday, the government began selling sacks of food, called `` dignity bags,'' to unpaid workers. And the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent an additional 100 military personnel to beef up security around the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to allow <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> limited use of 17-year-old school bus drivers through the end of the school year. The governors of the two states today announced the agreement overriding a February order that had required a halt to the young drivers by April 1. `` During our discussions with -LRB- Labor -RRB- Secretary -LRB- <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, I think it became apparent that our school children would be a lot safer riding with 17-year-olds with seven or eight months of bus driving experience than it would be to have them riding with drivers who have little or no experience driving a school bus,'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. Without the extension there would n't be enough trained drivers to transport students, the governors contended. Under the agreement, all districts in both states may use drivers who will turn 18 before June 15. And certain districts that have had difficulty hiring older drivers may through the end of the school year use 17-year-old drivers who will not turn 18 by June 15. All 17-year-old drivers must have been hired and trained before the school year began and must have clean driving records, the agreement said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> has about 2,100 17-year-old drivers; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> has about 1,200. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskew </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, estimated several hundred 17-year-old drivers in that state would turn 18 by June 15. Seventeen-year-olds have been permitted to drive school buses in the two states under an exemption to the Fair Labor Standards Act. That was repealed after <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigations found <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> had violated the act 80 times in January and February, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> had recorded 200 violations in that time. The investigation was triggered when a 4-year-old boy in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, was struck and killed by a 17-year-old driver with a bad driving record. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said in a statement today that he would seek a $ 24 million from the legislature in June to increase the school bus drivers pay so the state can attract more adult drivers.

Former <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigg </PERSON> testified earlier. In addition, two former aides in <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s office, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, testified last week before the grand jury to which <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s office is presenting evidence. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s chief of staff before leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> several months ago <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> worked on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s staff in mid-1985. The probe of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> revolves around whether he may have violated the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribes by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies or their agents to foreign officials. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> wrote a memo to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in September 1985 saying that a portion of up to $ 700 million from the pipeline would be paid to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> says he does n't recall reading the portion of the memo relating to planned <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> payments. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had been hired by Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> to assist in the project and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> went to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on the matter in May 1985. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> referred him to then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who directed that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> assist the project. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was seeking an insurance package for the pipeline in the event it was bombed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Then-Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> gave assurances that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not attack the line, but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wanted a financial package to back up that promise. The <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aides assisted on a number of proposed packages, initially trying to promote a $ 400 million bank-backed package acceptable to the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The government agency insures foreign investments by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms such as <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was going to build the project. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> and his place on the project was taken by <PERSON> Wigg </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> on alternative proposals. Those included pledging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a guarantee for the pipeline and seeking to put <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget money for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in an overseas escrow account as insurance. None of the insurance proposals was adopted and the pipeline was n't built.

<HEAD>Panel Finds Little Evidence That Cabinet Status Would Improve VA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An independent study group said today it could find little evidence that elevating the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to a Cabinet-level department would help the agency do its job better. The group and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said changes in the way the VA is managed should be made whether or not the agency is granted cabinet status. In a report to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a panel of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said it was not making a recommendation for or against a Cabinet-level VA.. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, chairman of the academy's seven-member study group, said the panel did not take a vote on elevating the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> to Cabinet status, but he said, `` We did agree on the report. `` We are not here to discuss the priority of meeting the needs ... of veterans,'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> told the committee. `` We are discussing ... structure.'' The panel, which did the study in seven weeks, found `` little evidence that the prospects of fulfilling the vital mission of providing for the present and future needs of veterans would be materially improved by elevating the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> to a Cabinet department.'' The panel also said it does not believe the elevation to Cabinet-status `` would significantly improve either access to the president, the adequacy of necessary resources, or the organization, management and delivery of high-quality services and benefits. `` The panel does recognize the potential political value of raising the public visibility of the needs of veterans and the programs designed to meet these needs by making <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> a department in the president's Cabinet,'' the report said. `` However, given the broad political support which already exists for the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> and its programs, the gain would be at the margin.'' Legislation to elevate the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has been endorsed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 17. There has been strong support in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for passage. Governmental Affairs Committee chairman, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said at today's hearing: `` If the elevation of the VA to Cabinet-level status is accompanied by significant measures to improve the management and operation of the agency, as well as to ensure the fair treatment of all veterans seeking access to agency services and benefits, then the case for elevation becomes much stronger.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said improvements within the VA legislation `` should be the goal of this committee over the next few weeks.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, chartered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, provides independent advice on the organization and operation of government at all levels.

 Two soldiers were convicted and given less than a month in jail for their role in the brutal Arab beatings taped by an American television crew, the military said today. A military judge sentenced <PERSON> Ronnen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasson </PERSON> to 21 days in jail and <PERSON> Arieh </PERSON> <PERSON> Moalem </PERSON> to 10 days in jail, the army said. They were sentenced Monday following their convictions on charges of brutality and harassment. <PERSON> Sasson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moalem </PERSON>, along with two other soldiers and an officer, were taped by a CBS news crew on Feb. 25 as they beat and kicked two bound Palestinian youths in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the largest city in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The soldiers kicked the two Arabs in the head and chest, then picked up fist-sized rocks and smashed them on arms and legs. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said the beating lasted 40 minutes. The film produced widespread criticism and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> commander, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, ordered the detention of four soldiers and their commanding officer, all from the elite <ORGANIZATION> Golani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>. The army said an investigation showed that <PERSON> Moalem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sasson </PERSON> played a relatively minor part in the beating. The film did not show <PERSON> Moalem </PERSON> taking part. The army said that the two other soldiers involved, <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harpaz </PERSON>, and their commander, Capt. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>, will face more serious charges.

<HEAD>Deputies Seek `Hard Worker' Who Allegedly Buried Stolen Cars And
Wastes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HESPERIA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who spent months industriously burying stolen cars, trucks and other equipment in the back yard of his rural home was being sought today, officials said. The man, identified as <PERSON> Korey </PERSON> <PERSON> Cragg </PERSON>, jumped out a back window of his home when he was questioned by a deputy, sheriff's Detective <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cragg </PERSON> was being sought for an alleged role in a car-stripping operation. By Monday afternoon officials had unearthed more than a dozen cars and trucks plus various equipment and car parts, officials said. They also discovered numerous buried 55-gallon drums containing motor oil, gasoline and transmission fluid. For months, residents living in the desert 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> had watched as <PERSON> Cragg </PERSON> buried the vehicles with a backhoe, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said. `` A neighbor told us he was hauling out a trailer load of engines every other day,'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said. `` He was a busy, busy boy. It appears he was working 24 hours a day. ... He could go through two or three cars a day.'' <PERSON> Sylvestre </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON>, who lives in a home just east of the house, said he thought his neighbor was `` just a hard worker.'' `` He'd be at it day and night,'' <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON> said. `` He was a pretty good mechanic, or so we thought.'' Someone finally called the sheriff after seeing <PERSON> Cragg </PERSON> bury an almost-new car over the weekend, and a deputy confronted <PERSON> Cragg </PERSON> on Sunday. After answering a couple of questions, <PERSON> Cragg </PERSON> excused himself to go to the bathroom. Instead, he climbed out a back bedroom window and fled, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said. Police found a stolen red Corvette in the garage and secured a search warrant, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said. Three people inside the house at the time were booked for investigation of grand theft auto, a jail deputy in <LOCATION> Victorville </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of here, said. They were identified as <PERSON> Cragg </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Hesperia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, 26 and <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> VanSanford </PERSON>, 28, both of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Bail was set at $ 200,000 each and the three were scheduled for arraignment Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Victorville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the deputy said. On Monday, county detectives-turned-archaeologists returned to excavate the cache of stolen property. The car-stripping operation apparently started about five months ago, and <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said officialos had not idea how many vehicles they might eventually find. He said investigators expect to find even more buried cars in the surrounding desert. `` That's just a guess at this time,'' said <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>. `` Neighbors say he would haul the backhoe out into the desert to bury stuff.''

 Monsignor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> was named Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> today and became the first black archbishop in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> called his appointment `` a great sign of hope to all of our people.'' Blacks have a rich religious tradition, but `` not a rich tradition that enriches the Catholic church,'' <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said today at a news conference in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said he was `` not one to dodge issues; at the same time I am not one to go out and look for issues for issues' sake.''

There are about 1.3 million blacks among the 52 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Catholics. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> is the first black Catholic archbishop in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Some people in the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> still believe a serpent swallows the sun every night, but those who do n't are buying `` eclipse viewers'' at about $ 2 each to watch a total solar eclipse. <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is one of the best places to see the eclipse Friday morning. It will be visible longer in <LOCATION> Mati </LOCATION>, but you can hardly get there from here or anywhere else. The viewing devices are made of cardboard, in the shape of eyeglasses or scopes, with exposed photographic film as lenses. An estimated 1,500 scientists, journalists and observers from all over the world will bring more elaborate equipment to watch the moon blot out the sun. A Department of Tourism brochure says the rare phenomenon will be visible Friday in three areas: <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kkalimantan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION>, and the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, where it can be seen longest. Nowhere will the view surpass that in the <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> area, 600 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. For three minutes, day will become night as the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> moves between the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and the sun. Darkness is expected to envelop neighboring <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> at 9:05 a.m.; <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> at 9:07 a.m., and <PERSON> Mati </PERSON> in adjacent <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oriental </LOCATION> province 38 seconds later. Along with the makeshift glasses and scopes, the most popular items at sidewalk stalls in advance of the eclipse were baseball caps at $ 1.50 or less and T-shirts ranging in price from $ 1.75 to $ 6. Some shirts proclaim `` I was there.'' Others depict a man battling a huge serpent wrapped around the sun, representing the ancient belief that the sun disappears each day because the serpent <LOCATION> Bakunawa </LOCATION> swallows it. Friday morning could be noisy in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> and General <LOCATION> Santos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. People who still believe in <LOCATION> Bakunawa </LOCATION> will bang pots and pans in hopes the noise will distract the serpent's attention from the sun. Although the eclipse is expected to last longest in <LOCATION> Mati </LOCATION>, the town has been all but ignored in advertisements because it has only two small lodging facilities and is much harder to reach than the <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santos </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Layson </PERSON>, regional tourism officer. Officials said most of the visiting scientists, journalists and other foreign observers would stay in General <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. They are expected to spend about $ 750,000. <PERSON> Layson </PERSON> said most of the foreign astronomers are American and British, and most of the other observers Japanese. All hotels and other facilities have been booked since January, and tourism authorities have arranged lodgings in private homes for $ 7.50 to $ 10 a day. There have been reports of threats by rebels to disrupt the event, but <PERSON> Layson </PERSON> said news reporrts of some visitors canceling reservations were `` exaggerated.'' Both the Moslem rebel <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla New People's Rebels operate in the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Moslem insurgents said they plan a demonstration in <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, the front's 16th anniversary, but rebel sources said it would be peaceful.

 A woman and her daughter have returned to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> after retired <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commandos hired for $ 200,000 grabbed the girl in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> where she had been taken by her father in a custody dispute, newspapers reported today. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> expressed regret to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> over the incident, and an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officer in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> was recalled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for questioning about his knowledge of the affair, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported on Saturday that the woman and the commandos entered <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and seized <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON>, 7, from a school bus Jan. 28 in <LOCATION> Jerash </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>. The woman had been identified at <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoon </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Planells </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Held </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hostage </ORGANIZATION>, said her name is <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON>, The Dallas Morning News and the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The woman claims her ex-husband, Jordanian-born <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON>, kidnapped the child and took her to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> although she was granted custody of the child following a divorce. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> court records confirm that a judge granted Ms. <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> custody of her daughter, but police say they have no record of the reported kidnapping in September. `` She -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> -RRB- called me from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and said they're alive and well and very happy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Planells </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, told the Morning News on Monday. `` She's really getting assimilated back to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> life,'' Ms. <PERSON> Plannels </PERSON> said, referring to the girl. `` It was a traumatic experience to be away from her mother like that. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is a strange place.'' Ms. <PERSON> Plannels </PERSON> declined to say where Ms. <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> is, saying the woman fears her husband `` will try this again.'' Ms. <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON>, unable to get her daughter back through legal channnels, hired former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> commandos to take the girl away from her father, who claimed legal custody of the child under Jordanian law, the Inquirer reported Saturday. Corporate Training Unlimited, a company in <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, that specializes in `` hostage rescue training,'' plotted and carried out the seizure, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> quoted Ms. <PERSON> Planells </PERSON> as saying the operation cost Ms. <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> $ 200,000. Ms. <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> has mentioned the possibility of a movie deal about the raid, Ms. <PERSON> Planells </PERSON> said. Company president <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON> denied the story, but other well-placed sources described the company's role, the <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON> reported his daughter had been abducted by three Americans and he published newspaper advertisements seeking information. <PERSON> Sameer </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> friend of <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON>'s, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON> had returned to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in fall 1987 after selling a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> restaurant called The Country Skillet. The recalled <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official, who was not named, had some knowledge prior to the incident that the group had arrived in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. But the officer had been misled as to its intentions. `` We have expressed regret to the government of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> for any role that an embassy officer might have played in this violation of Jordanian law,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. There was no official comment from <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> authorities. However, one <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official, who did not want his name used, said a Jordanian citizen was involved in getting the girl out of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. He said the man was an employee of an agency which does security work for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and that he had been detained for questioning. He did not give the man's name.

<HEAD>300 March in East Germany to Demand More Freedom</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 About 300 protesters defied police orders and marched in a human chain to demand greater freedom from the communist government, witnesses said Tuesday. Police did not intervene except to order by loudspeaker that the demonstrators disperse, the witnesses said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The demonstration came Monday on the second day of the <ORGANIZATION> Leipzig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION>, which draws visitors from 100 nations. The protesters came out of a `` peace prayer'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Nicholas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, marched about 500 yards to another church where they sang songs, and then walked back to where they began, said the witnesses. The protesters voluntarily left after about 40 minutes. They were among more than 1,000 people who attended the prayer service at the Lutheran church, according to the witnesses. Church officials speaking at the hour-long prayer service were applauded when they demanded greater freedom for East Germans and an end to legal actions against those who want to leave the country, the witnesses said. An unidentified church official was quoted as telling the congregation that the country needs laws in line with international conventions. Officials of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have become increasingly outspoken in favor of improved human rights conditions in the country. The witnesses also said government officials banned a Monday night rally where activists had planned to publicize the plight of East Germans who are denied the right to leave the country.

 A Nigerian official said Tuesday the government will press ahead with its population control project over the objections of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders who argue it favors Moslems. The plan to curtail the growth rate in black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most populous nation, with about 95 million people, created considerable controversy when it was announced last month.

Several prominent women have demanded that the government also institute a plan to limit <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> men to one wife. The government's population control plan attempts to limit women to four children through education campaigns. Air Marshal <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ruling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the government intended to advance the plan anyway. `` This is a policy that will take some time to take hold, and we are quite aware of the problems it would face,'' he said.

<HEAD>Studies Say Changes Needed at VA, With or Without Cabinet-Level
Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Significant changes in the way the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is being managed should be made whether or not it is elevated to Cabinet status, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee was told Tuesday. A panel of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, an independent study group, and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, did not make recommendations on whether the VA should become part of the president's cabinet. But in its reports to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the seven-member academy panel said it found `` little evidence'' in its study that Cabinet-level status would materially improve the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s mission of providing for the present and future needs of veterans. `` The panel does not believe that such an elevation would significantly improve either access to the president, the adequacy of necessary resources, or the organization, management and delivery of high-quality services and benefits,'' the report said. The panel said it `` does recognize the potential political value of raising the public visibility of the needs of veterans and the programs designed to meet these needs by making <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> a department in the president's <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. However, given the broad political support which already exists for the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> and its programs, the gain would be at the margin.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said signficant changes are needed in the way the VA is being managed, and that they should be made whether or not the agency is granted Cabinet status. `` To appropriately manage any large, decentralized organization, top management must have reliable information on each unit's output and the resources used to achieve the output,'' the office said. `` <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reports have documented situations in which top managers were unaware of inefficient or poor quality services because they lacked complete, reliable and accurate data and the incentives to use those data to improve service delivery.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy administrator, or the undersecretary if the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> is made a cabinet department, be given the responsibility for the agency's day-to-day management. The academy panel said it had seen reports of internal weaknesses in the VA. However, it concluded that a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> department is not required to make necessary improvements, `` although the creation of more presidential appointments could improve the quality of veterans programs by attracting better managers.'' A Cabinet-level VA could possibly achieve more uniformity of broad, cross-cutting national policy goals, the panel conceded. However, it said, `` there are other mechanisms now in place or available which have been, and could be, used to accomplish these purposes whether or not the VA is elevated to be a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> department although Cabinet status might make the current mechanisms work more effectively.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has endorsed legislation to raise the VA to Cabinet status. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a similar bill last Nov. 17. There also has been strong support in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for passage of the legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> is an independent agency created in 1930. It provides health, disability, pension and death benefits to veterans, as well as loans and educational programs.

 Judges in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s war crimes trial granted a defense request Tuesday to admit new evidence from 15 Holocaust survivors who failed to identify the retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker as a Nazi guard. Defense attorney <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> said the new evidence casts doubt on testimony from five <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp survivors who identified <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> from a 1942 photograph as `` Ivan the Terrible.'' Prisoners used that nickname for the guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` There are 15 statements of <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> survivors who did not identify <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> as <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> versus five who did,'' <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` This evidence is extremely substantial and extremely important.'' The three-judge panel interrupted its deliberations Tuesday to consider the new evidence during a special session in <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s year-long trial ended Feb. 18.

<HEAD>Capitol Police Seized 1,162 Weapons Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Capitol Police, who have arrested visitors carrying an Uzi machine gun, a pistol disguised as a beeper and soda bottles containing explosives, are worried about a 147 percent surge in weapons seizures at the Capitol last year. The police confiscated 1,162 weapons from visitors entering the Capitol or six adjacent <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office buildings in 1987, up from 470 weapons seizures the previous year, according to House Sergeant at Arms <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Russ </PERSON>. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> is citing these figures to lobby for an $ 18.5 million plan to tighten security on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> side of the Capitol, including bombproof glass around the visitors' gallery overlooking the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> said in an interview that most of the weapons last year were seized from visitors who were unaware of gun control restrictions at the Capitol and had no criminal intent. These included constituents carrying out-of-state gun permits that are invalid on the Capitol grounds. Of the 1,162 arrests on illegal weapons charges last year, he said, only 63 were prosecuted, compared with 50 arrests prosecuted in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> security plan being pushed by <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> calls for spending $ 4.2 million to install shatterproof glass shields around the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> visitors' gallery and modify seats on the chamber floor to protect against bomb blasts. He also is requesting a $ 4.7 million emergency telephone system to alert every <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office immediately to a terrorist attack, $ 413,352 worth of additional bomb detectors in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office buildings, a $ 3.5 million electronic card system for access to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> garages, and a $ 5.7 million alarm system connecting home-district offices with local police. Strict anti-terrorist proposals, such as placing a wrought iron security fence around the Capitol grounds and glass enclosures around the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> galleries, have been widely criticized in the past. Many legislators argue that the Capitol, as a symbol of open democracy, should be easily accessible to the public. But <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> says this is unrealistic because of growing security threats. `` I think everybody _ me included _ would like the easy-going atmosphere of a Mayberry RFD police force, with a friendly cop directing traffic,'' <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> said. `` But in this day and time, you also need a high-tech, well-trained police department. You've got to have both.'' <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> outlined his plan last week at a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the proposed $ 1.96 billion budget for congressional operations next year, and plans to seek spending authority from a separate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. Still awaiting action by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leadership is a more sweeping security plan that calls for fencing in the Capitol Plaza, a parking ban on the East Front plaza and gatehouses to screen visitors before they enter the Capitol grounds. Although only authorized vehicles are permitted to enter the Capitol grounds, pedestrians may enter unhindered and are not screened for illegal weapons until enter the Capitol building itself, or adjacent office buildings. The comprehensive security plan for the entire Capitol area has been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, consisting of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sergeants at arms, the <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> chief and the architect of the Capitol. A $ 13 million appropriation to implement the plan remains largely unspent, awaiting a final go-ahead from congressional leaders. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> said he hopes the leaders will meet before the end of April to review the broader plan. Meanwhile, police are using hydraulically operated, steel street barricades to halt unauthorized vehicles at the two main traffic entrances to the Capitol grounds. In addition, large concrete flower and shrubbery pots stand along driveways and sidewalks to thwart any attempted truck bombings of the Capitol.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> registered his objections today to a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace conference and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the two had been unable to bridge their differences on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for negotiations on settling the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. But both pledged to continue their efforts. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a speech to an American Jewish audience, described the situation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> as `` urgent.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also gave assurances in talking to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> that `` we will not leave <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stand alone, nor will we acquiesce in any effort to gang up on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The president added: `` Peace will not be imposed by us or by anyone else. It will and must come from the genuine give-and-take of negotiations. That's what we're working to set in motion now.'' Emerging with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> from a 90-minute session at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said `` we have n't found our way to bridge all of the differences.'' But, he said, `` I see quite clearly what the nature of the difference are and what they are n't.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not offer any details, but <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> underscored a major disagreement with the plan for negotiations <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> devised two weeks ago and proposed to Arab and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders. `` We are interested, first of all, to negotiate directly with all the parties concerned,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. `` We do n't see any positive role for an international conference.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan would have an international conference attended by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> convene last month and set the stage for negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a mixed <LOCATION> Jordanian-Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation by May 1. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is concerned the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which do not have relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, would try to tilt the outcome in the Arabs' favor. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> called his session with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> `` very constructive and worthwhile'' and said `` we feel encouraged to continue our efforts to work with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and others in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to seek greater stability, constructive and peaceful relations in the region.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said their talk was ` ` very serious and thorough. He pledged to cooperate with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and others in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government `` to get peace and to enhance the prospects for peace in our area.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, meanwhile, added <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a television evangelist seeking the Repulbicn presidential nomination, to his afternoon schedule. In a tough speech Monday night to an American Jewish group, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said yielding territory on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> would invite another attempt by the Arabs to destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` These matters are questions of life and death, of our very existence,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> group. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan for peace talks anticipates <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> relinquishing at least some of the territory in exchange for Arab recognition of the Jewish state. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said `` the two most dangerous attempts to destroy us'' _ in the 1948 and 1967 wars _ were made when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did not control the territories. During a stop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Monday to meet with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish leaders, and then in an arrival statement at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prime minister made it clear he would not give <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> a yes-or-no answer on the peace plan. Instead, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> seemed intent on persuading the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to revise its blueprint. It calls for a peace conference by May 1 to set up Palestinian self-rule for three years, and then negotiations by December on an overall settlement. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters at the White House under rules of anonymity, appeared to rule out any major revisions in the proposal <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> gave 10 days ago to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The official acknowledged `` it gives pain to all of the parties,'' but he said `` we wo n't let any aspect be eroded or compromised.'' So far, the official said, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> had not rejected the plan, which he called an improvement over the 1978 Camp David agreements that produced a peace treaty between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but failed to resolve the Palestinian problem. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who met briefly Monday with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, had a busy schedule today. It began with breakfast with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> at his home, lengthy talks with him at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and congressional leaders. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader sees President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday. While <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> promised to keep an open mind in the talks, he took a hard line on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s retention of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> in his speech Monday night. `` I am astonished at some people's short memory,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. `` Did we have peace when we did not have these territories? Do n't they remember that the two most dangerous attempts to destroy us _ in 1948 and in 1967 _ were made when we did not control any of these territories Do they want us to go back to a situation which would inevitably invite another such attempt?'' Referring to the recent violence on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> in which 91 Palestinians have perished, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said `` it is not a war for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in those areas. It is a war against Israelis, against the existence of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.''

 The protective ozone layer over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appears to have shrunk about 2.3 percent since 1969, scientists said today in the most thorough study yet of ozone depletion. Experts have estimated that a 1 percent depletion could mean a 5 percent to 6 percent increase in skin cancers. But today's report from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the work of more than 100 experts over 17 months, put the annual ozone depletion over the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere at a much higher rate. Those latitudes, 30 degrees to 64 degrees, take in all of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> except southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and extend halfway up <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s Yukon Territory. The scientists laid the responsibility for the ozone depletion squarely on chlorofluorocarbons -LRB- CFCs -RRB-, chemicals used to power some aerosol sprays. `` At this point there is no other culprit to blame,'' said <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>. `` We have taken out all the natural phenomena that are believed to affect ozone.'' The report also said that the annual springtime depletion of ozone over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> appears to be diluting ozone yearround over the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> to about 60 degrees southern latitude, a point midway between the tip of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> at the southern tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, who headed one <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> study groups, said the scientists had re-examined years of ground-based and satellite observations of the atmosphere to remove the normal biennial fluctuations of many atmospheric characteristics and also the effects of the 11-year solar cycle. The ground-based observations were limited to mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere because there are few stations elsewhere in the world. But never before have scientists re-analyzed the monthly data at differing latitudes to try to remove the solar and biennial fluctuations. Ozone in the atmosphere 15 miles to 25 miles up filters out the sun's ultraviolet rays, making life on earth possible. The same ultraviolet breaks up the <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds, liberating chlorine, which in turn destroys ozone. Ozone is a pollutant on the ground, but CFCs do n't break up there _ not enough ultraviolet gets through. CFCs were banned as aerosol propellants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1978, and worldwide emissions declined. There was one report in 1983 from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> that said future ozone decline would be only 2 percent to 4 percent. But <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use started growing again, in part because one compound turned out to be ideal for cleaning computer chips and other electronic parts. Other major uses are for refrigeration fluids and as blowing agents in making plastic foams. Then an annual ozone `` hole'' over the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> was discovered, and records going back to 1958 showed that it had n't happened before the late 1970s. Discovery of the ozone hole _ an annual Antarctic springtime plunge in ozone concentrations, last year by a record 50 percent _ spurred treaty negotiators last fall in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that a 1 percent thinning of the Earth's ozone shield means a 5 percent to 6 percent increase in skin cancer. If <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use continued increasing at 2.5 percent per year, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said, 20 percent of the ozone barrier could be gone in the next century. Today's report came one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, on a vote of 83-0, became the first major chemical-producing nation to ratify a 31-country treaty cutting emissions that damage the Earth's protective ozone layer The treaty commits the signers to a 50 percent cut from 1986 levels in production of compounds called chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs, by 1998. The treaty will be officially ratified when the president signs it. Though the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be the first major producer of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds to ratify, it is not the first ratifier _ that is <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Under the treaty, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says, the decline would slow to the point where it would be swamped by the normal year-to-year fluctuations. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has several <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> plants under construction, and won concessions permitting it to exceed the treaty limits for a time _ which led to a Soviet treaty signature in December. Similar provisions were made for developing countries. If those exceptions are used, the Environmental Defense Fund has estimated, the actual 1998 rollback in emissions could be 35 percent instead of 50 percent.

<TEXT>
 In an interview with his biographer, porno actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said he did not know who was responsible for a multiple murder in which he was a suspect, a newspaper reported today. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said that during the hours before four people were bludgeoned to death and a fifth was maimed at a house in <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> on July 1, 1981, he was held at gunpoint at another house. The Los Angeles Times, relying on two unidentified sources familiar with the manuscript of <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' as-yet-unpublished biography, reported that after his captors let him go, he went to the house where the killings occurred and discovered the bodies. The biography is based on extensive interviews with the actor, but it was not clear when those interviews were conducted. One of the sources said: `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> ... did not know up to the time of his death who did the murders. He was not there when it happened.'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> died early Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sepulveda </LOCATION> at the age of 43. He died of pneumonia brought on by AIDS, his second wife, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON>, said Monday. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a leading sex film actor of the 1970s and early'80s, was tried and acquitted in the murders in 1982. At the time of the killings, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was a cocaine addict. Within the last six weeks, homicide detectives again questioned <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> about his role in the killings, but he either refused or was unable to answer, the Times reported. Attorneys <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenman </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D </PERSON> <PERSON> Kibanow </PERSON> confirmed Monday that a biography of <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> has been offered to several publishers, but they declined to discuss its contents. The lawyers represent Mrs. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 24, and her husband's estate. The biographer's name was not revealed. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> had been hospitalized with acquired immune deficiency syndrome since November. Authorities have theorized that the <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> killings were committed to avenge an armed robbery of nightclub owner <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>. Former Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coen </PERSON>, who prosecuted the case, said <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was a middleman between <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and a theft ring. <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> set up the armed robbery of <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> and later was forced to lead the killers to the Laurel Canyon house where members of the ring were staying.

 Two married Department of Corrections guards have been charged with conspiring to kill two robbery witnesses for $ 50,000, authorities said.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, U-2 and other Western rock groups will join Soviet musicians for a series of concerts to raise money to fight drug addiction. The concerts, originally scheduled for this month, are to take place in late April, the <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. Novosti did not give a date, but said the three six-hour concerts will be held at the 30,000-seat Olympic Stadium in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The agency did not say why they were delayed, but sources close to the organizers blamed the postponement on bureaucratic red tape. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said former Beatles <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, as well as <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, the son of the late Beatle <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, had been invited. It was unclear whether they would participate. The press agency said revenue from ticket sales will be donated to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> fund for the struggle against drug addiction and to the Soviet toxicology research center. Sponsors include several Soviet organizations and trade companies from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Soviet officials denied reports of drug abuse in the country until <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for greater openness. Now, newspaper stories often point out the problems and have disclosed there are 50,000 diagnosed addicts and many more who may be undiagnosed. Novosti said musicians from 10 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries will peform along with several Soviet groups. Among the foreign groups that have agreed to perform, Novosti said, are Level 42, <PERSON> Supertramp </PERSON>, U-2, Foreigner, <ORGANIZATION> Tangerine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dream </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>. Participating Soviet groups are Aquarium, <LOCATION> Bravo </LOCATION>, Brigade S, <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> and others whose music ranges from heavy metal to traditional rock' n' roll, according to Novosti. Tickets will be about $ 16, much more expensive than for the average Soviet concert. When <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> performed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last summer, tickets sold for a little under $ 8.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is investigating another 29 possible cases of Americans who never returned home from the Vietnam War, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military official said Tuesday. The latest inquiry could represent a significant step in resolving the fates of nearly 1,800 Americans listed as missing in action since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> withdrew its troops in 1973. `` The Vietnamese told us they are investigating 29 instances where they have received information, material or remains,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. `` But they said it will take at least three weeks for them to draw any conclusions from these investigations or to have remains to repatriate.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Joint Casualty Resolution Center based in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, returned Tuesday from four days of what he described as `` positive and productive'' talks on accounting for the MIAs. It was the fourth round of negotiations since retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, a presidential envoy, visited <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in August and the Vietnamese agreed to end a deadlock on the MIA issue. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said his team provided new information to the Vietnamese. He said it also visited the crash site of an American aircraft near the major northern port of <LOCATION> Haiphong </LOCATION>, about 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, but he gave no details. At least 27 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft were shot down when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in December 1972 launched air strikes in the <LOCATION> Hanoi-Haiphong </LOCATION> area to pressure the communists into signing a peace agreement. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s team is composed of six experts from the casualty center and the Army Central Identification Laboratory. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Can </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, headed the Vietnamese side at the talks. <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> had asked the Vietnamese to give top priority to resolving 70 `` discrepancy cases,'' in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says there is strong evidence that Vietnamese officials know the fates of the missing Americans. These include cases where Americans failed to emerge from prisoner of war camps. Since <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>'s talks, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has returned remains it believes are those of Americans three times. The most recent, on March 2, involved 17 sets of remains _ the largest turnover in two years and the fourth largest since the war ended. The Vietnamese also turned over reports on three other MIA cases. In exchange for Vietnamese cooperation on the MIA issue, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has sent medical teams to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> four times and encouraged private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies to provide assistance to war-disabled Vietnamese. It has rejected calls for official aid because of continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 9-year-old military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

 The changing face of his home district finally caught up with Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>, an Italian-American who spent 20 terms crusading for civil rights but who is now reluctantly giving up his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat to make way for a black successor. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Democrat, who gained national prominence when he chaired the impeachment hearings of former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, yielded Monday to calls from minority constituents who want one of their own to represent them. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>, 78, one of the most senior members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of its powerful <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement saying he would step aside in January. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, the next ranking Democrat on the committee the past 13 years, will be <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>'s likely successor. `` Chairing that committee would be an honor and a privilege should my colleagues extend me that opportunity next year,'' said <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, who currently heads the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> would have to be officially named by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and elected by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. Committee members said they expected <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> to be the next chairman. `` It is not without a sense of sadness that I am announcing my decision to retire from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at the end of this term,'' <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> said. Although he did not mention the demands of blacks and other minorities, who now comprise the majority in his district, <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> had been under increasing pressure to step aside. A host of black leaders _ most notably Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ lauded his record but urged him to make way for what would be <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s first black member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In his statement, <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> said, `` I believe that my part of the journey in this great American experiment is at its end. I feel I have served my time and a purpose.'' <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1948, a 38-year-old lawyer from an <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> neighborhood in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, eager to represent the bustling city in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He became an institution in the intervening 40 years: fighting for liberal legislation, controlling one of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' most powerful committees and helping write into history the downfall of a president. But in those same years, <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> decayed from the heart of the Garden State into the brunt of jokes. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>'s political base eroded, and three black Democrats, including two <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> city councilmen, announced plans this year to seek his 10th Congressional District seat. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>, respected even by those calling on him to retire, had survived earlier challenges. In 1984 and 1986, he won re-election even though <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> to lead the retirement calls himself. Backers, both black and white, noted <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> served as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor manager for the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1966 and wrote the 1982 Voting Rights Act. He is an honorary member of the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> and has been honored by the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> is a good man,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. `` That's not the issue. We can have a good man and black man from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> at the same time.'' During his fight two years ago, <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> hinted strongly he would retire after another two-year term. He said said he wanted to stay in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to counter the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. But, as <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> began last year to raise campaign funds and plan for re-election, black and white leaders in his party accused him of breaking a promise. Aides said he wrote the resignation statement in his Capitol Hill office on Monday, then left for his home. The announcement brought immediate accolades for <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>. `` I will miss his knowledge and his friendship. He sets an extraordinarily high standard for whomever will succeed him,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <PERSON> D-N.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> served nearly 20 years as a representative before being thrust into the national spotlight. In 1974, barely a year after his predecessor's defeat in a renomination battle gave <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gavel, the panel was charged with reviewing <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s role in the Watergate affair. The televised proceedings won <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> respect for his evenhanded handling of an emerging national crisis. In an interview last year, <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> recalled weeping after he and a majority of committee members voted to deliver articles of impeachment to the full House. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> resigned before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> also served on the House Iran-Contra committee, which investigated the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's handling of the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the funneling of profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.

<HEAD>President Urges Clemency for `Sharpville Six'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today urged clemency for the `` <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, saying such action would be `` welcomed by all Americans.'' The six blacks are scheduled to be hanged Friday for being in a mob outside a home where a township official was killed. In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has refused to block the hangings, but added that any further petitions for mercy would be given `` careful consideration.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters, `` The president urges clemency for the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on compassionate and humanitarian grounds.'' `` We implore the South African government to respond favorably to these requests,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` An act of compassion such as this by the South African government would be welcomed by all Americans.'' `` Our disgust for apartheid has been stated many times, and we continue to speak out for its total elimination,'' the spokesman said. He said the administration was appealing directly to South African officials for clemency, as well as making the paublic statement. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had previously appealed for clemency in the case through public statements, support of a resolution in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and representations at diplomatic talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` We are making this view known officially as well as publicly to the South African government,'' he said.

<HEAD>US Official Urges End to Speeding Penalties For States</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal official urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday to eliminate the penalties that face states whose drivers ignore the 55 mph speed limit, but two senior lawmakers said they are writing bills that would do just the opposite. Reps. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> surface transportation subcommittee, said they are working on measures that would extend the penalties to states that have adopted the 65 mph limit States with 55 mph limits can lose up to 10 percent of their federal highway aid if monitors find that more than half their motorists are driving too fast. But when two laws were passed last year allowing 65 mph driving on many rural highways, the penalties were not extended to roads where states allow the faster speeds. `` The states are clearly in the best position to determine where speed enforcement is needed to enhance safety,'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steed </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement delivered to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s panel. `` They should be able to deploy enforcement personnel accordingly, without the threat of losing federal funds.'' Lawmakers from the 11 states that have retained the 55 mph limit have complained that it is unfair for their states to face the loss of federal assistance while states that permit faster driving can not be penalized for motorists speeding on 65 mph roads. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he is writing a bill that would apply the penalties to 65 mph highways. An aide said the measure could be ready in a week. `` The states simply have no economic incentive to enforce the speed limit laws on higher speed routes,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said of present conditions. During a break in the hearing, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said he is shaping a bill that could roll back the number of miles of roads where 65 mph driving is allowed, and make it easier for 65 mph states to be penalized for drivers violating the speed limit. `` It's a more dangerous speed,'' he said of 65 mph.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should give top priority to negotiating reductions of 50 percent to 75 percent in conventional military forces in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, former U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> said Tuesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> also said she believes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should continue restrictions on trade with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in an effort to win human rights improvements inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` So long as the Soviets do not permit the free flow of people across the borders I do not believe it is appropriate for us to permit the free flow of goods across borders,'' she said. At the same time, she said she is not opposed on principle to expanding U.S.-Soviet trade `` as long as the trade is profitable to us and does not subsidize them.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> commented at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> which was organized to monitor Soviet compliance with the human rights provisions of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords. She said it was not `` inappropriate'' for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to have signed the new Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces agreement eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles worldwide. But she said she does not believe that agreements reducing specific nuclear weapons systems are very important as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies retain superiority in conventional forces. `` I think the top priority of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be to negotiate real reductions _ 50 percent to 75 percent _ in conventional forces in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' she said. The hearing was convened to explore the impact on the nations of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of the reforms insituted in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> called those reforms important, said they should not be belittled and said of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>: `` I believe his sincerity can not be reasonably questioned.'' `` I think in fact <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is the kind of man who would like to dismantle the structure of oppression'' in order to revitalize the stagnant Soviet economy and retain his nation's superpower status, she said. `` He has made ... significant steps toward the release of political prisoners and dissidents in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` I think that for both internal and external reasons <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has concluded that repression and reliance on force is undesirable,'' she said. `` What we do n't know is how far he is willing to go.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> said there is relatively little <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy can do to influence the Soviets as the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> policies of glasnost -LRB- openness -RRB- and perestroika -LRB- restructuring -RRB- run their course. Responding to questions, she said she does not believe that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators should hold agreement on reductions in intercontinental strategic nuclear weapons hostage to Soviet agreement to make human rights improvements. `` I'm not personally in favor of using arms reduction to win concessions in human rights,'' she said.

 A colorful new English-language tabloid hit the streets Tuesday in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, the best-served newspaper market in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with six dailies. The splashy <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> was an instant success in this bilingual city. Many newsstands sold out of the first press run of 80,000 copies. With minority-interest financial backing from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, owner of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION>, the new tabloid features color pictures and the blue-collar standbys of sport, crime and sex. The lead headline was `` OUT _ No Appeal for Turk Refugees,'' a story about the deportation of 40 Turks. The principal owner of the paper is <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Peladeau </PERSON>, whose company <ORGANIZATION> Quebecor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> also produces <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s leading French-language daily, <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peladeau </PERSON> said he was prepared to invest $ 20 million in the tabloid in the next five years to firmly establish it in an English-language market previously monopolized by the serious-toned broadsheet <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, circulation 196,000. The Daily News is the Gazette's first direct competitor since the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> folded in 1979. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s second-biggest city is also served by the French dailies <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Devoir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Matin </PERSON>.

 CBS seems to have reclaimed the top spot in the news Nielsens as the glow of the Winter Olympics wears off <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. For the week ending March 11, the `` CBS Evening News'' had an average rating of 11.1 and a 21 share, its second win in a row. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' had a 10.2 and a 19 share. `` NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.4 and 18 share. The rating is the percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. After a lengthy reign at the top of the news ratings last summer, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is now struggling in third, although the close ratings make the news race virtually a three-way tie. `` We're in the middle of a big investigation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>. He said the network is awaiting more information from <LOCATION> Nielsen </LOCATION> on the February sweeps before deciding whether the slide is a result of <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>'s new people-meter sample or a real decline in viewership. <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> pointed out that results from the November sweeps showed <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> with a distinct disadvantage in local news lead-in. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> affiliates had an average rating of 11.5, which `` Nightly News'' improved on, to 11.9. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had the best advantage. Its affiliates had an average rating of 12.9, and the network newscast improved on that to 13.1. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> affiliates averaged a 12.0 rating and the network broadcast was a 12.3. `` Network news is an island in a sea of local news,'' said <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>. `` If the local news is going down, there's not much you can do to keep the network news from going down, too.'' If the Winter Olympics helped <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> to first in news, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> can look forward to potentially the same boost when it carries the Summer Olympics.

 The White House, pushing for new aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, told congressional leaders today the Sandinista regime appears to be preparing `` an all-out death blow'' against the Contras, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Describing a lengthy meeting in which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> discussed the possibility of a new Contra aid package with lawmakers, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> quoted national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> as saying: `` The resistance program is on the verge of collapse. It's only a matter of weeks.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` asked for bipartisan support to keep the resistance from withering away and to prevent a dismantling of the infrastructure that supports the Contras.'' The spokesman said that in the Cabinet Room meeting, `` General <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> outlined the buildup of <LOCATION> Sandindista </LOCATION> forces for an offensive in the <LOCATION> Bocay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, and it was indicated that Sandinista forces appear to be preparing to launch an all-out death blow to the Contras by destroying the supplies now in major Contra camps.'' `` There was a considerable discussion of this turn of events.. and the implication that has for the peace process,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said But he stressed that no decisions were reached in the meeting about how to proceed with a humanitarian aid package. `` I think everyone in there agreed it was a time to look forward and to talk about how to fashion a new package, and let the fights and arguments in the past stay there,'' the spokesman said. `` There was no anger. ... Everyone, I think, was intense in the sense that they think this was a time of decision for the national government.'' `` I think it's important to point out that everyone in that session agreed a cease fire is what we're going after and that if you get a cease fire, that relieves the tension for lethal aid and for an awful lot of other kinds of aid,'' he said. `` The important thing now is the humanitarian package that we could use to meet their human needs.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, speaking to the Prime Ministers Club earlier, accused the Sandinistas of practicing religious oppression, particularly against Jews. He said President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government had aligned itself with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, talking to reporters following today's meeting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, reiterated that he would be willing to reconsider a $ 30 million humanitarian aid package that was defeated 216-208 in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on March 3. `` We told the president that we had worked very diligently, Democrats and Republicans, to put together a package'' which was defeated, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` We would be glad to run it again if they -LRB- the House Republicans -RRB- would be of a mind to vote for it.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said it would be virtually impossible to suspend <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules to get a vote on a new package this week, as the administration wants. And one congressional supporter of renewed Contra aid, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., said an aid package he has been working on was `` on hold'' for the moment while aid backers look for a way to get agreement in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, always the most problematic hurdle on the Contra issue <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, appearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a group of approximately 150 supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>, said that among other reasons the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should support the Contra rebels is the oppression of Jews in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` Few regimes today so blatantly sanction and practice official anti-Semitism as the Sandinista communists in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` The Jewish community has been forced out almost entirely. <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s one synagogue has been defaced and firebombed. ... `` `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has officially aligned itself with <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>,'' he said, `` and, of course, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> _ an organization that has again revealed its true colors, opposing our efforts for peace and trumpeting its responsibility for a sickening terrorist attack on a bus carrying Israeli men, woman and children.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> `` have led the way in sponsoring anti-Israel resolutions in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. So I think it's time that some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who want to turn away from the reality of left-wing anti-Semitism face the facts about the anti-Semitism of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> as well as their ties to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and other terrorist groups.'' `` It is the Nicaraguan freedom fighters who are resisting this kind of moral corruption,'' he said. `` It is the freedom fighters who are fighting for the political, civil and human rights of Jews and Christians in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The rebels and the Sandinista government have agreed to sit down and talk about their 7-year-old civil war on March 21-23 in the town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> near the Costa Rican border. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a political director of the umbrella opposition group the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to represent the rebels, and Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, brother of Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, is to represent the leftist Sandinista government.

<HEAD>Report Says Cuba Short Of Dollars</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A severe dollar shortage forced the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government to ask Western creditor nations earlier this year to reschedule its foreign debt over 15 years, including a five-year grace period, according to an official document made public Tuesday. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s inability to meet it debt repayment obligations was blamed on `` extremely adverse external factors,'' the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said. The study was obtained by <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative human rights group, and copies were distributed at a news conference. The authenticity of the report could not be verified independently but it was similar in style and content to a study by the same bank several years ago which also was made available in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. At the time, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government acknowledged that the report was an official document. There has been no report of the outcome of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s request for debt rescheduling, but <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a former deputy minister of trade in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> who defected in 1985, told the news conference the appeal was unsuccessful. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s dollar shortages stem partly from the decline in the world market price of oil. Under a special arrangement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> sells oil on the open market and sends the earnings to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said these revenues reached a high of $ 584 million in 1984 but dropped to $ 284 million in 1986, the last year for which figures are available. Disputing the report's claim that external factors are unfavorable for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s situation is `` exceptionally good'' compared with other countries because of Soviet generosity. In addition to the oil sales bonus, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said the Soviets pay four times the world market price for Cuban sugar. This subsidy amounted to $ 22 billion between 1975 and 1985, he said. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> listed <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s debt to Western creditors at $ 5.5 billion. Most of that money is owed to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said. The report was prepared for a January meeting of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s creditors in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> It described 1987 as `` one of the worst years'' for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> because of the combined impact of adverse weather conditions, the sustained slide of the dollar and `` the dramatic decrease in imports from the freely convertible currency area.'' It said a number of industries dependent on these imports suffered `` diminished performance'' as a result.

 When <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> was starring in the 1934 film `` Spitfire,'' her mother was getting plenty of her own attention as a `` spitfire'' for her outspoken support of birth control for women. Today, the 79-year-old Miss <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, with her family's characteristic wit and keen intelligence, has taken on her mother's cause and become one of Planned Parenthood's staunchest In a tribute Monday night, entitled `` Celebrating Two Generations of Individual Courage,'' the actress and her late mother, <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, were honored by Planned Parenthood for their efforts to gain greater reproductive rights for women. `` It's a frightfully important subject,'' the actress told the 1,100 guests gathered at the Waldorf-Astoria for the black-tie event. `` And I'm damn lucky to have had a mother who waked me up at an early age.'' Tickets for the gala were priced from $ 500 to $ 1,000, with proceeds going to Planned Parenthood dedicated to the actress' three priorities: keeping abortion safe and legal, preventing teen pregnancies and preserving family planning for the poor Former TV anchorman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>, tennis champion <PERSON> Martina </PERSON> <PERSON> Navratilova </PERSON>, TV journalist <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, star of the Broadway musical `` Me and My Girl,'' were among the participants. As guests arrived, they encountered a small protest by the Stop Planned Parenthood organization. Guests rose to their feet and applauded as Miss <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, elegantly attired in a black pantsuit, approached the podium. `` It's so touching to me, I can hardly begin to say what I have to say,'' she said. But she had much to say. `` When a girl becomes pregnant, should she be forced by law to have this baby? She's 13. She does n't want it. She ca n't support it. Her family does n't want it. It would seem to me that she should be allowed to have an abortion.'' `` By the same token, if an older woman with several children gets pregnant and feels that she ca n't support it or care for another child, I can not for the life of me see that anyone but this woman has the right to decide what she's going to do,'' Miss <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> said. `` It's certainly much harder to be a woman than it is to be a man,'' she lamented. `` But men got here first and arranged everything to suit themselves. And it's taking women a long time to ... try to catch up.'' Miss <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> became involved with Planned Parenthood in 1981. The group's president, <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON>, said she recruited her because she was `` someone who really had the public's respect.'' Her participation in the organization has brought an additional 200,000 donors and supporters. It was only after the actress agreed to work for Planned Parenthood that, Ms. <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON> said, she learned `` serendipitously'' that Miss <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>'s mother had been an outspoken advocate of birth control at a time when it was illegal. Mrs. <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> worked alongside Planned Parenthood founder <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> more than 70 years ago. A member of the <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> family that founded Corning Glass, she testified before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the 1930s on the need for birth control, particularly for poor women. `` Women want children but they want children they can properly take care of,'' she testified. She died in 1951 at age 73.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bid Tuesday for an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary victory that would doom the Republican presidential campaign of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> dueled <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a battle of Democratic favorite sons that made third place attractive to their rivals. In the first industrial state to vote, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought to leave Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> far behind. The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primaries included presidential straw polls and separate elections of delegates to the nominating conventions next summer. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, winner of 16 out of 17 Super Tuesday contests last week, led <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> by huge margins in the pre-election polls in the Land of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. He looked for his first primary win on Midwestern soil, and an increase in his seemingly insurmountable lead in convention delegates. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spent the day campaigning in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> in a demonstration of his determination to stay the course _ even though he had speculated about withdrawing if he suffered another big defeat. He said he hoped to win 40 percent of the delegates at stake during the day. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the former television evangelist campaigning as a conservative alternative to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said he might quit if he failed to pick up 5 percent of the vote. `` I'm not <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON> and I'm not going to tilt against windmills,'' he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was rated the slight favorite on the Democratic side as he sought a victory he said was essential to sustain his candidacy. He campaigned as the man to represent <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> at the bargaining table of what he said would be a brokered Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. But pre-election polls suggested <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s popularity among black voters could propel him to his first industrial-state victory, and the Chicago-based civil rights activist forecast a `` significant breakthrough.'' He voted at a South Side church in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used a combination of personal campaigning and $ 250,000 worth of television ads in an appeal to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> supporters to reject <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s strategy of forcing a brokered nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides said they would be pleased if that made <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> the winner, since a <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> withdrawal would eliminate a rival for white, liberal support in the next states to vote. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> all follow next weekend's <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> caucuses. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> cast a primary-day ballot in <LOCATION> Makanda </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and said, `` We have to win both'' the popular vote and the delegate contest to stay alive in the race. He said he would do both, and spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> predicted the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator would pick up 135 of the 173 national convention delegates at stake. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was locked in a close race nationally with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for national delegate superiority and hoped to establish position over the field for the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses on March 26. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign said he has a reserve of some 100 delegates won in caucuses in other states that have been held but have not yet been counted. Going into <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 462.5 of the 2,082 needed to win the nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 423.55, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 352.8, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 145 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 35.5. Republicans elected 82 of their 92-member delegation Tuesday. Democrats picked 113, with an additional 60 to be allocated later at a state convention on the basis of the evening's results. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began the day the prohibitive leader in the delegate competition on the Republican side with 705 of the 1,139 needed to clinch the nomination. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had 165, while <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had 17. Illinois' separate delegate elections looked like an easier contest for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, although <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was expected to virtually sweep the competition in the predominantly black congressional districts in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Most of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s delegate candidates were well-known figures locally, and they urged him not to drop out of the race after earlier primary disappointments, at least partly so they could have a chance at attending the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> this summer.

 Thus ended the campaign in the first of the industrial states to vote, a battle that seemed as clear-cut on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> side as it was complicated for the Democrats. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned like the prohibitive front-runner that he was after his Super Tuesday rout, in which he won all 16 primary elections and lost nly a caucus state _ <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. He ignored <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s repeated demands for a Lincoln-Douglas-style debate without moderators and began tailoring his campaign to the independent voters and potential <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> converts likely to hold the balance of power in the fall election campaign. He seemed to be gently trying to nudge <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> out of the race, declaring, `` I'm not sure I understand what he's doing.'' `` I've made a judgment that <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, whatever happens, we're going to keep going,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said at a news conference on Monday But he conceded candidates sometimes fail to understand when it is time to get out. `` Now if you're out there and you've been twisting in the wind for six or eight months and you're starting to smell a little, somebody has to cut the rope,'' he said. Nonetheless, his campaign was looking ahead to April 5, releasing this to the Political Hotline: `` On <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, On <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, grand old Badger state, `` We thy loyal sons and daughters hail thee good and great. `` ... On <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, On <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, fight on for her fame, `` Fight, fellows, fight fight fight `` We'll win this game.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> vowed to stay in the GOP race until the convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> as `` a champion of conservatives.'' But he also said a finish of less than 5 percent likely would force him to reassess his vow. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> supporters ranged from Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> to <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, once the Democratic kingpin of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> but now a Republican. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent $ 400,000 in television advertising to boost his vote. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> a `` recovery state'' after his Super Tuesday debacle and paid a memorable visit to the hospital where he recovered from crippling World War II wounds 40 years ago to underscore his point. But he conceded, `` We're hanging by our fingernails'' and he staggered through the week. He laid off more than half his staff, canceled television advertisements and was reported by aides to have discussed quitting the campaign even before <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> voted. He decided to remain a candidate and gambled on a 30-minute paid television broadcast Saturday night _ only to fall victim to a power failure that interrupted his statewide appeal in mid-sentence. The Democratic race was fittingly Byzantine in the land where local politics is a year-round sport. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was attempting a tough campaign restart _ without funds for advertising _ after sitting out the 21 Super Tuesday contests. He urged his home state voters not to desert him in his hour of need, and said he wanted to represent them at a brokered convention this summer. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded that a brokered convention would be a `` disaster'' for the Democrats and plowed $ 250,000 into television advertising in a bid to whittle away at <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s support. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who won five Super Tuesday states and followed up on Saturday with a victory in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> caucuses, said a victory in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> would be a breakthrough _ his first in an industrial battleground. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> hoping to ride the crest of a Super Tuesday-generated wave, but it failed to show up in the pre-election polls. He spent an estimated $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 on television advertising in search of a place to `` punch through'' in his battle to compete with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, the candidate with political momentum only five weeks ago when he won the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, gave short shrift top <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Aides said he was conserving his cash and his energy for a last stand in the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses on March 26.

<HEAD>Students Given Taxing Task: Simplifying IRS Forms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> are aiming for a breakthrough that has eluded some of the best minds in government and the professions: a tax form that can be understood without a college education. `` We know it can be done and we're going to prove it,'' Professor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Creme </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in the university's law school, said in an interview Tuesday. `` We're not saying we could bring it down to a second-grade level, but we certainly can make it simpler. `` If you simplify the forms, people will be a lot less hostile toward the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` And you'll raise a lot more revenue.'' <PERSON> Creme </PERSON> said about 20 students majoring in law, business or education will be put to work on the project. Testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Monday, some of the students and their leaders promised Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., that most of the work will be done by September The students got interested after seeing estimates that nine of 10 people with less than a high school education can not understand the instructions for the simplest tax form _ the one-page 1040EZ. That study also determined that it takes less reading skill to get through a typical issue of the Wall Street Journal than through a tax form. The reasons for the complexity are simple, say Creme and Professor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>, director of the university's Tax Clinic. `` The average sentence length of these -LRB- IRS -RRB- publications exceeds 25 words ... One-third of the words in these publications are multi-syllabled words.'' `` By reducing the number of syllables and the number of words in a sentence we can the forms and instructions significantly more readable,'' said <PERSON> Creme </PERSON>. `` And we want to change how the forms look _ change the spacing so things do n't look so crammed in.'' It is not just college students or even high school dropouts who are having trouble with tax forms. Even tax professionals shake their heads at some instructions that were prompted by some of the more complex provisions in the 1986 tax overhaul. This sentence, for example, is in the instructions for Form 8598, which up to 1 million taxpayers will have to file this year to calculate their mortgage-interest deduction: `` If you received monthly statements that show either the closing balance or the average balance for the month, you may determine your average balance by taking the average of either the closing balances or average monthly balances shown on your monthly statement.'' <PERSON> Creme </PERSON> said participants hope to develop more-readable versions of the W-4 withholding form; W-2 year-end wages-earned statement; 1099 interest-earned form and the basic 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ forms. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> forms are developed in consultation with lawyers, accountants and educators. In changing its forms last year to reflect the new tax law, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> hired a consultant and even went to some shopping malls for instant reaction from random taxpayers. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyrek </PERSON>, who helped develop the 1040EZ several years ago, says that form is written to an eighth-grade reading level. That does not mean, however, that a typical student in the eighth grade could understand it, he said. `` It means a grownup that understands certain concepts can understand the form,'' <PERSON> Pyrek </PERSON> said. `` A fourth grader does n't understand the concept of taxation, for example, although a 40-year-old with a fourth-grade education who has been on the job for 20 years probably does. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> concedes that many taxpayers find taxes puzzling. The agency's own statistics show that 46 percent of taxpayers paid professionals to fill out their returns last year. Nevertheless, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> contends that the forms and instructions are about as simple as they can be to reflect a complicated tax law. <PERSON> Creme </PERSON>, a tax lawyer for 20 years, said the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has nothing to lose by making its forms more understandable. `` When people ca n't figure out the right answer,'' he said, `` they will take the answer that gives them the best break.

 A witness for the prosecution at Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial said that a defense lawyer tried to intimidate him with obscene language shortly before he testified, according to an affidavit released today by prosecutors. Prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, replying to defense accusations that witnesses were being intimidated, released an affidavit saying that defense attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> had himself berated a witness and made accusations about the sex life of the governor's chief accuser. Craft accused state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> `` a consistent pattern of an abuse by the police power'' by intimidating witnesses. `` We are afraid in this state today because we've got a runaway police state.'' But French contended that a defense move to dismiss an obstruction of justice charge was a `` smokescreen'' put up because the governor can not disprove it. The impeachment allegations against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, include that he tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by then-state prison construction chief <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> against a former state official, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> testified last week that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> confidant, told her that if Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> did not keep her mouth shut about an unreported <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> campaign loan she might `` go on a long boat ride'' and come to harm. `` It has become apparent that there is no defense'' to the charge that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> tried to obstruct the probe, French said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted to take under advisement a defense motion to either dismiss the obstruction charge or declare a mistrial. A decision is expected Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel overseeing the prosecution released an affidavit from state official <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Corio </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> made statements about the alleged sex life of Department of Public Safety Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> has testified <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> ordered him not to cooperate with the death threat probe, while <PERSON> Corio </PERSON> testified Friday that he had been asked to search for listening devices in the governor's office and found none. Craft claimed that <PERSON> Corio </PERSON> changed his planned testimony after being seen with <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Corio </PERSON>'s affidavit said, `` I contacted DPS on my own. I have not been tampered with by <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Corio </PERSON>'s affidavit said Craft used obscene language on Friday in saying he did not have time to deal with him. According to <PERSON> Corio </PERSON>'s affidavit, <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> also said to <PERSON> Corio </PERSON> that <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> has sex with `` the widows of fallen officers to console them.'' <PERSON> Corio </PERSON> also claimed that <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> made <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> bureau chiefs put on his uniform so they could have sex with him. The affadivit did not specify the gender of the bureau chiefs alleged involved, and it also did not indicate whether the conversation was tape-recorded or how he remembered the quotes. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for an anti-terrorism seminar, but <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> called the alleged statements `` disgusting.'' Asked for further comment, he said, `` You ca n't print it. Craft indicated in arguments before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that he had seen the document, but he did not say whether he made the statements or not. On Monday, a former cabinet member and <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> confidante testified that a key prosecution witness lied about the alleged death threat. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, who was fired as state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> director by acting Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>'s public statements and testimony about the alleged threat were `` substantially different'' from what she told him in November. `` I think <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> really detested <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, a onetime <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> campaign chairman, testified. `` I think she really had it in for <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>,'' possibly because he had said bad things about her friend Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> before. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> repeatedly told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that he did not consider the alleged threat to be a serious matter. He said the story told to him by Mrs. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> was similar to what <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told him: `` People are excitable out there on both sides and she -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> -RRB- could end up getting hurt.'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said he did not remember Mrs. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> telling him anything about <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> saying Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> could get killed or go on a `` long boat ride.'' Sen. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a Democrat, chided <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, saying, `` You hear a threat and you do n't have the intelligence to discern a threat?'' The defense has accused the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> trying </ORGANIZATION> to intimidate <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON>, a defense witness who testified she did not believe a death threat was made. Ms. Fields, who is Mrs. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>'s secretary, was arrested Friday night on a January warrant accusing her of not attending court-ordered Alcoholics Anonymous meetings required after a drunken driving arrest. The <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> has denied attempting to intimidate any witness, but the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began a preliminary investigation Monday into the allegation. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 5, also is accused of concealing the $ 350,000 campaign loan and misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. He is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to be impeached in six decades. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is required to convict him. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> faces an April 21 criminal trial on charges of concealing the $ 350,000 loan, and a May 17 recall election.

 Buzzard spotters got a welcome sign of spring despite today's 20-degree temperatures when two birds drifted into a park, officially marking their annual return to <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>. `` It stopped snowing for a brief moment there, for 20 minutes, and the sun came out and the birds came drifting in,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Woinset </PERSON>, a ranger at Hinckley Reservation. `` Capt. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> called in the official sighting at 12:02 p.m.'' `` They probably would have been in earlier if it had n't been snowing, but they have trouble negotiating the snow. By Sunday, there should be quite a few of them in for the crowd,'' <PERSON> Woinset </PERSON> said. A flock of the large, long-necked black birds supposedly returns to its northern home at the park's Buzzard Roost each year on March 15. The annual buzzard search began in 1957 in an attempt to verify the legend that the birds return on the same day each year. <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metroparks </ORGANIZATION> ranger captain, agreed that the annual buzzard news tends to `` build on the tradition,'' but he discounted the possibility that the buzzards stay in <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> through the winter months. `` There's a flock of about 75 to 80 that stay in the <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> area during the year. We believe they fly to <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, during the winter ... though it's difficult to verify,'' he said. According to local legend, buzzards were drawn to <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> in 1819 because of tons of decaying game killed in the Great <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Varmint </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. On Dec. 24, 1818, 475 men and boys attempted to rid the 25-square mile community of predatory animals that had been attacking farm stock. The carcasses froze during the winter and thawed in the spring, attracting the buzzards.

 A jury awarded the estate of a prematurely born boy who lived only 24 hours $ 75,000 for pain and suffering after he received allegedly negligent treatment from a city ambulance crew. The six-member jury also awarded $ 350,000 to the child's mother, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Canty </PERSON>. The jury had ruled Jan. 15 that the baby was conscious enough to experience pain and suffering, but city lawyers argued that the finding was medically impossible and said they would appeal. <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorter </PERSON> refused on Feb. 29 to overturn the verdict, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Canty </PERSON>, then 21, went into labor in her home two months early on April 24, 1975. Her husband, <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON>, called the <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at least once, possibly three times, according to conflicting accounts. The baby, still in its amniotic sac and moving one appendage, `` lay between the mother's thighs visible to her during the alleged 45-minute delay and negligent treatment ...,'' the judge wrote in his decision. Mrs. <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EMS </ORGANIZATION> technician who finally arrived told her the baby was dead and refused to open the sac. `` Finally I asked her -LRB- the technician -RRB- if the baby was a boy or a girl,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> said. `` At that point she took a small instrument and slit open the sac. ...

 Only one man has lived longer on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s death row than <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who turns 52 on March 30, has been on death row since Dec. 4, 1973. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> was sentenced to death seven weeks later and was executed Tuesday. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was convicted of killing his ex-lover's husband after forcing the pair to engage in a series of sex acts while he watched, court records say. Former Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> signed a death warrant on <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> for July 26, 1979, but that was stayed and subsequent legal steps resulted in the case being sent back to <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for resentencing. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was again sentenced to death in August 1985, and the appeal from that hearing now is with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which heard oral arguments in September 1986. The court could affirm the death sentence or reduce it to life, clerk <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said Tuesday. In the original trial, the jury found <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> guilty and recommended life, but the judge imposed the death penalty based on a finding of no mitigating circumstances. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, jury recommendations in death cases are advisory, and the final sentencing decision is up to the judge. Although <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> has been on death row for more than 14 years, his case could to drag on for years more. `` He would have the right to start the process all over again as far as the new sentence is concerned,'' said assistant attorney general <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Martell </PERSON>. `` It's a new death sentence that has not been reviewed by any court, so he would have a right to take a petition to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was convicted of killing <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> on July 17, 1973. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>' body was discovered by a hunter July 21, and five days later the victim's wife reported the killing to authorities. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> later testified she once had lived with <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> but returned to her husband following the birth of a baby in June 1973. Mrs. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said she and her husband were forced to commit various sexual acts at gunpoint before <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> struck <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> with the butt of a rifle, then shot him. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> returned later to move and cover up the body.

<TEXT>
 A homeless man who refused to help his dying brother until he was offered $ 1,000 finally submitted to a blood test Tuesday to determine his suitability as a bone-marrow donor, blood bank officials said. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, 32, who lives on the streets and earns money by submitting to medical experiments, had initially refused to help his brother in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` If he dies, he dies,'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> had said. `` He's about as much a brother to me as you are.'' But he changed his mind after an anonymous <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> man who also suffers from a blood disease offered him $ 1,000 to take the blood test. Other family members had been tested but were found unsuitable. `` I was n't too proud of myself when I read in the paper what I had said. I sounded cold, but I guess all my repressed feelings came out,'' said <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, who had not been in contact with his family in 14 years. `` I do n't wish my brother any harm. It's just that my family only wanted me when they needed something from me. Where were they when I needed them?,'' he said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> submitted to the blood test Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Chidley </PERSON>. The test will determine if <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> is a suitable match for his brother, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, 38, who is dying from leukemia. If he proves suitable, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> stands to gain an additional $ 2,000 for donating marrow, the source of blood cells. `` I'm glad he did it and I hope it all works out after all this trouble,'' said the ill brother, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, who is married and the father of two. `` I just wish he had n't raised such a ruckus. There was no sense in doing that. He's a little rough around the edges, I guess.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> was released from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> last week after chemotherapy treatment. His disease is in remission, but he must have the marrow transplant within three to four months, his doctor says.

The philanthropist said he hopes his offer will not only save <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>'s life, but also help <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> turn his life around. `` I hope it works out well for both of them,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> said he hopes the money will enable him to give direction to an aimless life. `` I'm planning to do something constructive with my life, rather than destructive,'' he said. `` I'm thinking about leaving <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Ethnic feuding between Sinhalese and minority Tamils killed 10 more people Tuesday, Indian authorities said, bringing the two-day death toll to 17. Sinhalese attackers dragged away three Tamil bus passengers near <LOCATION> Tampalagama </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> and hacked them to death, according to a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. An hour later in nearby <LOCATION> Gomarankadawela </LOCATION>, Tamil rebels shot and dismembered seven Sinhalese, including a child, according to the Indian-Sri Lankan joint operations command. The rebels reportedly belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, who have been fighting for a separate homeland in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. An <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping force of about 50,000 came to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> at the government's invitation to stem such attacks after a peace accord was signed in July. The violence has persisted, however. Sri Lankan and Indian authorities say 98 civilians have died in <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> so far this month. At least 12 Sinhalese villagers were killed Monday in an attack by suspected Tamil rebels on the village of <LOCATION> Galmetiya </LOCATION>, according to Sri Lankan military officials. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people They claim they are discriminated against by the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON> <PERSON> Buddhists </PERSON>, who control the government and military. Militant Tamils have been fighting since 1983 for a separate homeland. They have rejected the Indian-brokered peace accord of July, saying it fails to protect their interests. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> hopes to foster peace in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, an island just off its southern tip, because an estimated 60 million Tamils live in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s southern states.

 Convicted murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> went to his death Tuesday proclaiming his innocence and thanking people around the world, from <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who aided his 14-year battle to escape the electric chair. For the widow of the man he shot between the eyes, <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s execution on an unprecedented seventh death warrant offered hope, finally, for peace of mind `` I think it's long overdue,'' <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> said minutes after the execution about 7 a.m. at the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison. `` He did it to himself. I'm just thinking right now I want some peace of mind ... it's been a long time and I'm glad it's finally over.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> has remarried since her husband, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turman </PERSON>, was killed Sept. 8, 1973, after <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> walked into their <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> furniture store and found his wife being robbed of $ 15. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> also was unmoved about the international attention <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> attracted, from death penalty opponents and people who believed his conviction was racially tainted. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> was black; <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> was white. Among 1,600 telephone calls Monday, the majority protesting, was one from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Nobel Peace Prize winner <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, actress <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>, rock star <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and other human rights and religious groups also all called for a halt to <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s execution. `` I think justice was served today,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said later. `` This was not someone out of a choir. He was a career criminal. This was a man who had a career of violent crimes.'' It was the 18th execution in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and 96th in the nation since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1976 that states could again invoke capital punishment. Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> was executed in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s electric chair for the 1978 murder of a police officer It was the first time two inmates were executed the same day in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since Aug. 28, when executions were carried out in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, 54, gave a final taped interview Monday with <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, broadcast on `` Nightline.'' He had exchanged letters with many people and had become known as the `` sage of death row'' for the poetry he wrote as he pressed his claim that he was unjustly accused and convicted. But although he had promised in the `` Nightline'' interview to be `` hollering ` innocent, innocent' `` as he was strapped into the electric chair, <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> instead offered, without notes, a firm, evenly delivered, last denial. `` I was not guilty for the charge for which I was arrested, and this morning I tell you I am not guilty of the charge for which I am about to be executed,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said to 30 witnesses in the death chamber. `` I say to my friends and supporters around the world: I love each and every one of you. Your love and support has been a great comfort to me, and my struggle for justice and freedom. `` I go this morning with a clear conscience. I bear no guilt. I'm at peace with myself, with the world, with each of you. God bless you.'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> winked and nodded at one of his attorneys just before the hood was put over his head, and was declared dead at 7:12 a.m. after 2,000 volts of electricity flowed through his body for two minutes. Two puffs of smoke rose from his right leg where one of the electrodes was attached. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, a federal judge and the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>'s appeals on his seventh warrant. No inmate on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s death row had ever survived more than three warrants on the same crime Before dawn Tuesday, 40 people gathered in a pasture across from the prison. The protesters maintained silence until the execution took place, then began singing `` We Shall Overcome.'' Court records say that after shooting <PERSON> Turman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> ordered his wife to perform oral sex on him while <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> lay dying a few feet away. A neighbor, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, also identified <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> during the trial. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, then 16, entered the store after apparently hearing the shooting and the woman's cries. He was shot three times but survived. Death penalty opponents, led by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, have said <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> had an alibi proving his innocence. They claim statements from a minister and a woman show <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> could not have committed the murder. In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, about a dozen people demonstrated Monday outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and bishops in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> had urged a halt to the execution. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Snow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the second of four children. His conviction record dated to 1964 and included attempted rape. Only <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> had been on death row longer _ by seven weeks. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was convicted of the July 1973 shooting death of his former lover's husband.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, hoping to regain the momentum he established in long-ago <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, waited for the Democratic presidential field in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, site of free-for-all caucuses uncluttered by any favorite-son bias. The stakes in the March 26 caucuses were high and the campaign was already in gear as <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> voted on Tuesday. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wrapped himself in influential endorsements and sought to establish himself as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> sought a big-state victory outside his native South. And <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> looked for delegates in a state that shorted him in 1984. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the first contest post-Super Tuesday, was destined to leave no deep imprint on the Democratic race, given its two-way favorite son loyalties to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. So <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> looms as the next big contest, with 138 delegates at stake. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> skipped over <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and headed straight for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, a state that would seem tailor-made for his tough-on-trade, save-the-farms message with its $ 15 billion agriculture industry and import-triggered auto industry layoffs. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is hoping the message saves the messenger. `` If we do n't do well here, obviously we're not going to be able to continue in this race,'' he told <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> supporters last week. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was the first to hit the airwaves with a commercial featuring his tough talk on trade sanctions, his family farm legislation and an endorsement from elderly champion Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` From the farms, the factories, the neighborhoods, comes the yearning for change, and now our cause finally has a voice,'' the ad says. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> support that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> cornered in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is missing here. Unlike 1984, when the union endorsed <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> more than a year before the balloting, labor leadership has taken a vow of neutrality. The word to the rank-and-file has been `` Support the candidate of your choice.'' The 650,000 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> members appear to have taken that word to heart: their support is fractured. Former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, still popular with the rank-and-file, has endorsed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, various union locals have donated telephones to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s phone bank, and other union leaders have asked for management favors to arrange short-notice plant tours for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. Even Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> plays to the labor audience here, touting scorecards issued by the national <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s political action committee. `` I have been a friend of organized labor ... in 12 years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said Monday night in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. In 1984, the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> system left <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s delegate winnings far short of his 16 percent popular vote. Detroit Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> actively opposed him and mobilized the city's black vote for <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. This time, the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign ambushed Young by quietly winning over the ministers, unionists and party activists that form the backbone of the Young machine. Young favors <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in this race, but the mayor is unable to promise the turnout <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> enjoyed. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign plans no television, instead concentrating on ethnic radio and making sure the core constituency of black Democrats knows where to go to vote, said <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> campaign chief <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is also getting a good reception from white voters in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s campus communities. The <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign's goals seem to be twofold: prove a Southerner can do well in the Rust Belt and siphon away enough votes to push <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> below the 15 percent threshold for winning delegates. `` For a modest investment we can take enough votes to cut <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> out of the race,'' one <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> supporter said privately. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had one of the first <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> campaign organizations in place, but his future was uncertain.

 A federal agency proposed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that it be allowed to offer insurance to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses to help them stay in countries threatened with political turmoil, such as the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. But the proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> prompted Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON>, D-Wash., to say: `` Would n't that be like offering health insurance to someone who's terminally ill? `` Or like fire insurance on a house that's burning,'' agreed <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to sell the insurance against political risks. <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON> was quick to add that such policies would only be offered in consultation with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We would not go forward if Molotov cocktails were coming through the windows of the plant,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs subcommittee on economic policy, which <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON> chairs. <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON> explained that an insurance policy would be offered in order to prevent a company leaving a country. `` That could be devastating to a country that's in difficulties,'' he said. <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON> offered the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> as an example and <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON> suggested <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> as another. <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON> said the idea needs further exploration. In testimony prepared for the subcommittee, <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON> emphasized that the purpose of the insurance would be to keep the country concerned economically stable and would be offered only in rare circumstances. `` It is very unlikely that private insurers would be interested in underwriting the kinds of exposures <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> would be considering under this authority,'' he said. The new authority would permit the agency to offer insurance to new or existing companies. <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON> said members of his staff also have been discussing agreements for insurance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms operating in the territory of two communist governments: <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON> reminded him of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law that prevents economic favors to countries that limit emigration of their citizens. <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION>'s job is to insure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investors in other countries against political risks, including war, domestic violence, confiscation and the freezing of their assets. It also makes loans for investment. <PERSON> Nalen </PERSON> told the subcommittee that in the last three years it had promoted $ 8.7 billion worth of investment in 61 countries and turned a profit of $ 300 million.

<HEAD>Lawyers In Chambers Case Sum Up Wednesday, Prosecution To Suggest
A Motive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The prosecutor in <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' murder trial plans to suggest during closing arguments a motive that might have led him to deliberately kill <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> in Central Park, a source said Tuesday. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON> said at the beginning of the 11-week trial that she would prove Chambers intended to kill <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, 18, and that it was not an accident during rough sex as he claimed. She told the jurors that the prosecution is not required to prove motive and that the real reasons for the killing might remain forever locked in the defendant's head. Other lawyers, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike, agree generally that juries like to hear a motive when they are being asked to convict someone on a charge of intentional murder. Chambers, 21, is charged with second-degree murder in the strangulation death of Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> on Aug. 26, 1986. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, a former drug abuser and <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> dropout who has been indicted on burglary charges in another case, admits he killed Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> but says it was an accident after she attacked him sexually and hurt him. The summations by both sides are expected to take most or all of Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> will likely give the jurors final instructions Thursday before they begin deliberations. Ms. <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON> said in her opening statement that <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' assertion that the killing was an accident was `` ludicrous. A source said Ms. <PERSON> Fairstein </PERSON>, to emphasize the beating Chambers allegedly gave Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> before he killed her, might display a large color photograph of the teen-ager before she died next to a gruesome morgue picture showing red welts and bruises on her body. The judge has said he will instruct the jury to consider every category of homicide, including two charges that carry no mandatory minimum sentence. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said that besides the two types of second-degree murder which with Chambers is charged _ intentional and `` depraved indifference'' to life _ he will tell the jury to consider first-and second-degree manslaughter, and criminally negligent homicide. During Tuesday morning's court session the jurors watched Chambers' vidotaped admission for a second time so the lawyers would not have to interupt their summations to replay it. The replaying of the tape had an emotional effect on <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, the victim's divorced parents. When Ms. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> started crying, her ex-husband hugged her and eventually escorted her out of the courtroom. They had no comment as they left.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Propose Trade Sanctions on Haiti To Force Democratic
Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday proposed to impose a series of trade sanctions on <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> unless it takes steps toward establishing what the lawmakers regard as a more democratically elected government. The group introduced legislation to revoke <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s 7,500-ton sugar quota, which enables the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation to sell sugar at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> price-support level more than three times the prevailing world price; suspends other trade preferences; and directs the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to oppose loans to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> by international development banks. The bill also would formally continue in force the suspension of nearly $ 59 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, would impose an embargo on any arms shipments from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and would express concern about the growing use of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> as a transshipment point for drugs from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, one of the backers of the legislation, said the current Haitian regime of <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was the result of `` fraudulent elections'' held in January and that the military still rules the nation. `` Many Haitian citizens, in spite of the continuing oppression which they face, continue to work for democracy in their country,'' <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` We must support them and their cause, and we should disassociate ourselves from the murderous thugs who unlawfully usurped the rights of the Haitian people.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, another supporter of the bill, called for the dismissal of Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, the Haitian military chief. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> drew parallels between <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Both have been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug-related charges. jpd

<TEXT>
 A lawyer planned an appeal and the government agreed Tuesday to hear more calls for clemency for the `` <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>,'' a group of blacks sentenced to hang in two days. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> joined the growing international call for mercy for the five men and one woman, who were convicted of complicity in the 1984 lynching of a black township official. `` I am not saying that a sign of mercy will solve the problems of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but it might be a little signal that human feelings have not died out altogether,'' West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> told a news coference in <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, where he was on a state visit. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has rejected all clemency bids for the six, the goverment said Tuesday. But he agreed to meet Thursday with two members of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who oppose the executions, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that further petitions for mercy would be given `` careful consideration.'' <PERSON> Prakash </PERSON> <PERSON> Diar </PERSON>, attorney for the six, said he would file an appeal in the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to seek a stay of execution. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, meanwhile, said she asked <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on Tuesday in another bid for clemency. The condemned are <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramashamola </PERSON>, 26; <PERSON> Mojalefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefatsa </PERSON>, 32; <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON>, 24; <PERSON> Oupa </PERSON> <PERSON> Diniso </PERSON>, 32; <PERSON> Duma </PERSON> <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON>, 28; and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokgesi </PERSON>, 30. They were convicted in the September 1984 killing of black township councilor <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION>, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. No evidence was produced that the six were among those who hacked and burned <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON> to death. They were convicted under the doctrine of `` common purpose,'' which holds they were responsible for the killing by being part of the mob that gathered outside <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON>'s home with the intent to kill him. One of the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> planned to meet on Thursday was <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> who called the executions `` sheer madness'' in remarks to the body on Tuesday. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> said the executions would have have a devastating effect on international opinion. `` What reputation do we have in the outside world anyway?'' responded <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` An example must be set,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't allow these people to roam the streets and intimidate the moderate black who is only too willing to negotiate with us.'' <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said British Ambassador <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Renwick </PERSON> was given instructions `` to express my hope that President <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> will see fit, even at this late stage, to exercise the perogative of mercy.'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> told reporters that the executions would contribute to the violence and tension in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where the system of apartheid gives control of the country to the white minority. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights organization, also urged <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to spare the six. The organization expressed shock that 164 people, only nine of them white, were hanged in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON>'s killing came during riots that sparked a two-year outbreak of nationwide anti-apartheid unrest that left more than 2,000 blacks dead. Black activists frequently targeted black township councilors, considering them collaborators with the white-led government. The <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> riots were provoked by the local council's decision to raise rents.

<HEAD>Reagan Will Offer Alternative After Vetoing Civil Rights Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will propose an alternative when he vetoes a sweeping civil rights bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the White House said Tuesday. The president is scheduled to act on the bill Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill 75-14 and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed it 315-98, which are margins substantially greater than the two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto. The measure is designed to reverse a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that limited the reach of laws protecting women, minorities, the elderly and the disabled. The bill would require entire colleges, school systems, government agencies and private entities to comply with anti-discrifminaion laws if any program or activity within them receives federal money. The court decision limited this requirement to the specific program or activity involved. The bill is known as the <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> bill after the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> college involved in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case. Noting that Wednesday is the deadline for vetoing the bill, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that `` at the time of that presidential action we will be offering an alternative administration proposal for overturning the <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> decision.'' `` The president has always believed that the <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> decision was a mistake and that the non-discrimination protection decisions that were available before that decision should be restored,'' he said. As far as the congressional bill is concerned, however, he said, `` We have said all along that we would veto.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has objected to the bill on grounds that it `` dramatically expands the scope of federal jurisdiction over state and local governments and the private sector'' and `` poses a particular threat to religious liberty.'' `` We think we have a very positive alternative bill that overturns the Grove decision and also lays out our civil rights objectives in these areas and states the very important civil rights principles that we think need to be restored in terms of preventing discrimination,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman said White House officials `` believe that if this alternative bill has enough support that it would be voted instead of an override.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the bill would be different from the Republican alternative that was offered and defeated in the House. He declined to elaborate.

 <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> launched his campaign for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucuses Tuesday by trumpeting the endorsement of legislative leaders and depicting the race for the presidential nomination as a decision `` whether or not the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is viable in national elections from here on out.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, contending he stands a better chance than his rivals of attracting independent voters, was looking beyond Tuesday's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary _ to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s statewide caucuses on March 26 In a news conference near the state Capitol, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was endorsed by the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, the Democratic leader in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, and other state legislators. `` This is a battle for the future of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a battle that will determine whether or not the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is viable in national elections from here on out,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. He was addressing his familiar appeal for support from `` working men and women'' to the state's heavily unionized work force, describing himself upon arrival in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Monday night as a `` friend of organized labor.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he would use existing trade laws to bring down unfair barriers to trade overseas. However, drawing a distinction with rival <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s retaliatory policies, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> pointed to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as bearing most of the blame for the nation's large trade deficit `` Now we must acknowledge that 80 percent of the problem is with our own policies and the policies of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. He pointed to his own 88 percent approval rating by the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> over his career in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and said that was particularly noteworthy since he comes from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, a state without the Northern states' tradition of organized labor. `` It is a record that's been built up in the political fires and forces of a right-to-work state,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he backed the rights of states to have such laws banning compulsory union membership. `` I believe in the right to organize,'' he said, but `` what decisions states make, that's for them to determine.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he hoped to `` substantially exceed expectations'' in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> but refused to predict a victory and said no state was make-or-break for him. `` We're starting at a point where other campaigns are ahead,'' he said of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> planned to fly to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> to campaign Wednesday and Thursday toward that state's Democratic caucuses March 19. Aides said they were considering having <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> go Friday to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, where delegates are selected March 28. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> strategist, described the race in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> as between <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also met privately with <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> fund-raisers and said his fund raising has improved greatly since his victories in the South last week. `` It was the difference between night and day before and after Super Tuesday,'' he said.

<HEAD>Whites to Live in Black Township for Four Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 200 black and white Christians will live and worship together this week in an unusual attempt to break down the psychological and social barriers created by apartheid. Most of the participants are whites coming from across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to stay Wednesday night through Sunday in <LOCATION> Mamelodi </LOCATION>, the main black township outside <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. About 35 blacks from <ORGANIZATION> Mamelodi </ORGANIZATION> will stay in white homes in the capital. The encounter, culminating with a community barbecue and and a church service, will be the largest interracial get-together of its type in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. One of the principal organizers is the Rev. <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a Dutch Reformed minister in <LOCATION> Mamelodi </LOCATION> since 1982. He moved there two years ago after becoming the first white permitted by the government to live in a black township. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says relations between the races in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are warped by fear and estrangement. `` Since I'm living in the black community myself, I have become aware of the almost total alienation which has developed between whites and blacks,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` Apartheid was successful. It brought about what it promised to do. It separated people,'' he said. `` If people are forced to live separately they become strangers ... Eventually on both sides they have certain perceptions are totally different from the real people. This eventually turns into fear of one another.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and other clergymen organizing the four days of socializing, Bible study and prayer have brought smaller groups of whites into <LOCATION> Mamelodi </LOCATION> in the past. They said men and women sometimes tremble with fear as they enter a township that two years ago was wracked by violent anti-apartheid protests, political killings and factional battles. There has been some opposition to the encounter from militant groups in <LOCATION> Mamelodi </LOCATION> who say whites should be viewed as enemies. A right-wing white group called <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> sent letters to <ORGANIZATION> Mamelodi </ORGANIZATION>'s mayor and the commissioner of police asking that the meeting be banned. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said some black hosts have expressed fears that they will be arrested if they participate. Most South African blacks know how whites live because they work at white homes and businesses. Few whites know first-hand how blacks live because they seldom venture into the townships located on the periphery of the cities. One of the delegates, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Prest </PERSON>, said he has had blacks in his house near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> many times but has never visited a black home. `` The black culture is so set up that they do n't invite people to come,'' said <PERSON> Prest </PERSON>, retired director of a bible study program. `` They'll say, ` Why do n't you just come,' and I'll say, ` I've not been invited.' `` It's just a cultural problem,'' <PERSON> Prest </PERSON> said, `` and also a logistics problem. Also, it's very hard for an African to have you home, because of their accommodation, their facilities.'' The number of black delegates is much lower than the whites, said Baptist Rev. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, because it is harder for blacks to take two or three days off work. The main goal, he said, is to expose whites to the black lifestyle, encourage them to think about positive action to change the apartheid system, and take their knowledge back to their communities. `` Maybe for four days we will treat them -LRB- the white visitors -RRB- as blacks. They will start seeing things from the way we look at things, not the way they are used to looking at things,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramakgadi </PERSON>, a field worker for <LOCATION> Koinonia </LOCATION>, one of the organizing church groups.

Despite statistics showing the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> widening its lead as the world's largest debtor nation, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he had `` very little concern about the issue of direct foreign investment.'' `` We will find that foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be a plus,'' even at present record levels, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also suggested that a recession is unlikely throughout the next year. He cited recent positive economic statistics, including an unemployment rate that fell to 5.7 percent in February, its lowest level in almost nine years. He said the rate could drop further, probably somewhere between half a percentage point and a full percentage point, before triggering an increase in inflation. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said foreign investments flowing into this country now from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are a direct consequence of the large sums of money the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent in those areas in the aftermath of World War II. He testified as the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> current account deficit _ the broadest measure of foreign trade _ surged to a record $ 160.7 billion in 1987. The figures add trade in services and investment flows to other export and import numbers. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said direct investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by foreigners was preferable to them putting their dollars _ amassed through the trade imbalance _ into `` short term liquid holdings.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was asked by Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, whether he was troubled by the extent of the growing foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, particularly by Japanese companies. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is buying <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and leasing it back to us,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> suggested. `` On the contrary, the integration of the world economies ... is inevitable ... and is a desirable trend,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chief said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that foreign-owned businesses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had become `` good corporate citizens in the localities in which they chose to locate.'' He noted that in terms of direct investment _ excluding government securities _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business holdings overseas remain about $ 50 billion above holdings by foreigners in this country. In terms of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, foreign investors held 16.4 percent of the total at the end of last year, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also: _ Urged <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to do more to reduce its trade surplus and bring its economic and monetary polices into equilibrium with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other major trading partners _ Said the British government took the `` correct action'' in not seeking to stem the recent sharp rise of the pound through heavy central-bank intervention _ Praised <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for taking steps to stimulate its economy, but said that steps with a similar goal taken by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have not been as successful _ Said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is keeping in close contact with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the current turmoil in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> maintains an account for the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said.

 Bishop <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, named Tuesday as the first black Roman Catholic archbishop in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said his appointment as head of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> archdiocese is `` a great sign of hope to all our people.'' The appointment by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> comes more than two years after <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> and other black bishops wrote a pastoral letter calling on the church to increase the number of blacks in official positions. `` The church has spoken but has the church listened to itself?'' said the letter, suggesting that in the absence of a major appointment such as a black archbishop in a big city, `` the church's commitment to black leadership may be seen as half-hearted and superficial.'' The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> archdiocese has only 10,000 blacks among its 156,000 Catholics. Of 52 million Catholics nationwide, 1.3 million are black. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said he could see in his appointment `` a sign of hope to all men and women of good will that the church recognizes its wealth within its own ranks ...'' `` I think that this appointment is a sign of hope to all minorities that the church in general'' and the pope in particular are sensitive to the needs of blacks, <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, 53, is one of 12 black bishops in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and has served as an auxiliary bishop in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, archdiocese since 1974. In 1985, he was elected secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, the first black to hold an office in the organization. He is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION>, formed in the late 1800s to work in the black community. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>'s selection was hailed by an advocacy group as an outstanding appointment. Calling him `` quiet, but effective,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, acting executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> `` is a pastoral man and he is sensitive to the needs of lay people, especially the needs of black Catholic lay people in the country. `` We have optimism that the church is showing us signs of being responsive to the call by black Catholic lay people for black men to be elevated to positions of authority and responsibilty,'' <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> has represented the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> in congressional hearings, testifying about the needs of the unemployed and the homeless and for voting rights. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said his appointment did not necessarily make him the church's spokesman on civil rights, despite <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s historical position in the civil rights movement. He also declined to be labeled an activist priest, saying he was `` not one to dodge issues; at the same time I am not one to go out and look for issues for issues' sake.'' <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, said he hoped to be able to expand black membership in the Catholic church. `` We -LRB- black bishops -RRB- feel that this is a good time for our sisters and brothers to come forward with their gifts to enrich the church,'' <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said. `` We have a rich tradition of spirituality in the African-American tradition ... but it is not a rich tradition that enriches the Catholic church, unfortunately,'' he said. `` Our people tend to be religious, our people tend to be spiritual, but they do not tend to be predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and we feel that being <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> is something special.'' After meeting with some of the 200 priests in the archdiocese, <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> led a noontime mass at the Cathedral of Christ the King before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> will be formally installed May 5, to succeed Archbishop <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnellan </PERSON>, who died last Oct. 15. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> archdiocese covers 69 counties in north <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and has some administrative responsibility for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> dioceses in the rest of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> met with his Soviet counterpart Tuesday, hoping to prod Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> into providing concrete evidence of a new Soviet military doctrine. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, speaking to reporters en route to meeting <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, said that despite publicity surrounding the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> doctrine of reasonable or defensive sufficiency, he had seen `` absolutely no practical change.'' `` If anything, their military continues to grow. They continue to modernize,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, who also arrived in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> on Tuesday for the opening of the three-day session, said before he left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that he hoped for a `` frank, constructive discussion'' on arms control issues including strategic arms, nuclear testing, chemical and conventional weapons. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> emphasized that he did not want the meeting, the first business session between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet defense secretaries, to open a `` parallel channel'' to ongoing superpower arms negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> were attending a dinner by Swiss Defense Minister <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Koller </PERSON> on Tuesday night, and were to sit down for formal talks on Wednesday and Thursday. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and other Soviet officials have said they are moving toward a new doctrine, relying on defense. But Kremlin leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, and other military and civilian commentators have offered different versions of the doctrine, puzzling Western analysts. `` I'm still not sure what it is,'' said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` That's a question, by the way, I intend to ask him.'' If <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> wants to prove that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is moving from an offensive to a defensive posture, said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, he should seek `` a slacking off in tank production, in artillery production, maybe desisting from highly accurate follow-on systems like the SS-18'' intercontinental ballistic missile, which carries 10 nuclear warheads. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators have raised all those issues in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, but it is not clear when agreements may be reached to cut strategic and conventional arsenals. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts were looking for unilateral Soviet action to define the new <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> doctrine. `` One of the most important indicators, I would think, would be tanks. But tanks continue to pour out. So there is no indication at the other end of the pipeline that there has been any change,'' said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, in remarks reported from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, said nothing about the doctrine. `` The goal'' of the session, he said, `` is to facilitate the search for ways of resolving the most acute and immediate issues of strategic offensive weapons and the -LRB- 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile -RRB- treaty, reduction of the armed forces and conventional armaments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, termination of nuclear testing, and prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons.''

 The two people whose identification and testimony sent <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> to the electric chair expressed relief Tuesday that their ordeal had ended but anger that it had taken so long. `` I think it's long overdue,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, whose husband, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, was shot dead in front of her in 1973. `` I need to get on with my life. ... He -LRB- <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> -RRB- put me through torture. No one knows what I have suffered through his hands. ... It is torture when you see a loved one shot down in front of your eyes.'' A 16-year-old boy who came to her aid in the Turmans' Lakeland furniture store was shot three times but survived. `` Justice has finally prevailed,'' <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said at the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> asphalt company where he works. `` But it was n't as swift and efficient as it's supposed to be.'' While death penalty opponents and <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> supporters said his execution Tuesday meant the judicial system had failed, the prosecutor, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON>, criticized the length of the legal battles `` and the unnecessary waste of legal and judicial manpower that went into the case.'' `` Those opponents of the death penalty simply hitched their wagon to the wrong mule,'' said <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON>, now a private attorney in <LOCATION> Bartow </LOCATION>. `` I wish 10 percent of their efforts and the money spent could have gone to the victims. ... Mrs. <PERSON> Turman </PERSON>'s life was ruined ... because of this.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, 59, remarried four years ago. She was making breakfast and hurrying to take her husband, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, to a doctor when she was called by a friend and told that <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> had been executed. She cried a little. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> rejected recent statements by a Baptist minister and a <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> secretary, who disputed testimony about the attack. Their statements provided ammunition for <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> and supporters who said he had been wrongly identified as the killer. `` I identified him several days later -LRB- after the crime -RRB- because his face stood out to me. I know in my heart it was him,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> said. `` There's no doubt in my mind. There never has been,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>.

 As summer edges over the horizon, millions of Americans are contemplating exercise programs to help get into shape after a winter spent as couch potatoes; health experts also advise watcing the diet carefully. The American <ORGANIZATION> Dietetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has declared March to be <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Month </ORGANIZATION>, and is urging people to make good eating a personal way of life, not a dreaded prescription. `` We want everyone _ men, women and children of all ages _ to grasp one critical message: It's never too late to start reaping the benefits of healthy food choices,'' the association said in a statement. Federal health officials, too, stress the importance of good diet, noting that food choices can be a major factor in having a healthy heart, avoiding cancer and in feeling well generally. To help, a variety of federal agencies have put together booklets which can be obtained from the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, 81009. Among them are: _ `` Planning a Diet for a Healthy Heart,'' item 521T, no charge. _ `` Diet, Nutrition and Cancer Prevention: The Good News,'' item 517T, no charge. _ `` Diet and the Elderly,'' item 516T, no charge. _ `` Food Additives,'' item 518T, no charge. _ `` <ORGANIZATION> Nutritive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>,'' item 119T, $ 2.75. _ `` Some Facts and Myths About Vitamins,'' item 523T, no charge. _ `` A Word About Low Sodium Diets,'' item 525T, no charge. Generally, improving the diet should be done gradually, not all at once, says the <ORGANIZATION> Dietetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Set realistic goals and try to plan a diet with as much variety of food as possible. Many very-low calorie diets can create potential problems by not supplying enough nutrition. In addition, while these semi-starvation diets may promote quick weight-loss, they do n't promote a change in eating habits, so the weight is rapidly regained, the dietetic group points out While many folks shy away from making sudden, major changes in their eating habits, the <ORGANIZATION> Dietetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says it can be simple to take small, healthful steps throughout the day. It's easy to skip breakfast in the morning rush, for example. So how about planning ahead by preparing breakfast the night before, including such foods as fruit juice, a whole-wheat bagel, yogurt or perhaps a banana. Even if lunch means a business gathering, most restaurants offer dishes that are low in fat and cholesterol, such as chicken or fish or moderate portions of beef, as well as fresh steamed or raw vegetables. The association suggests ordering salad dressing on the side so you can control the amount put on the salad. If dessert is needed, consider fresh fruit or split a dessert with a friend. Smart snacking does n't mean going without, the group adds. Snacks can include unsalted nuts, plain crackers, low-fat yogurt, seltzer water, fruit juice or ice water with lemon. Popcorn _ leaving off the salt and butter _ also can make a good snack, as well as celery and carrot sticks or pieces of zucchini or green pepper.

<HEAD>Bill To Be Changed To Avoid Discrimination Against Religious
Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsor of a $ 2.5 billion child care bill said Tuesday he will change it to address complaints that it discriminates against religious groups who provide some of the nation's best child care. `` Within the next week or so we are going to resolve that issue,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., sponsor of the Act for Better Child Care or <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill `` These concerns will be resolved to the satisfaction of all.'' The bill, which has 37 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> co-sponsors, would provide grants to nonprofit agencies to expand child care as well as money for child care certificates to working parents with incomes below a certain level. It would deny funding for `` any program or activity that has the purpose or effect of advancing or promoting a particular religion or religion generally.'' And it would cancel a Civil Rights Act provision allowing religious institutions to hire employees on the basis of religion. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said his group supports the goals of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill and other child care legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but objects to those two provisions. `` We are working with the sponsors to see if the church-state problems can be resolved,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, the conference's secretary for social development and world peace, said in an interview. `` Much of the child care now provided is provided in churches and by religious groups, and we do n't want to see an effort to broaden quality child care exclude those groups. We're quite hopeful a solution can be found.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill was discussed at a hearing Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on children, chaired by <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>. Lawmakers across the ideological spectrum are reaching agreement that the nation needs more, better and expanded child care services to address what Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> called `` a bipartisan problem of families.'' The major points of contention are over how much to spend and whether states or the federal government should regulate day care. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, has proposed a somewhat different and less expensive approach to the problem. He said the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill's price tag is prohibitive while its licensing requirements and religious provisions seem to discourage home-based care and participation by religious institutions. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said the bill's sponsors are `` strong supporters of home care. We just want to see minimum standards'' for day care workers, homes and centers. He said the religious problem would be worked out. The only witness against the bill was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, lawyer representing the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of evangelical Christian educational institutions including 1,000 preschools. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said the schools on principle would not take federal money, but said parents otherwise eligible for aid should not be penalized for sending their children there. Conservative activist <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON>, who opposes any federal encouragement of day care, led a protest outside the building where <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> was holding his hearing. In the February edition of her monthly newsletter, <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON> referred to the <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> bill as an attempt to `` sovietize the American family by warehousing babies in government-licensed institutions where they would be subjected to secular, unisex custodial care by government-trained personnel, while their mothers would be trapped full-time in the paid labor force.'' Debra and and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gunnison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, presented a different view inside the hearing room. The couple's first child was killed when his day care provider _ a woman with no training and little experience _ struck him on the head. The woman, now in prison, was `` not a stranger. I considered her a friend,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. Her husband said the experience shocked him into realizing that his government was not monitoring or regulating child care. `` I had no idea of the things that could go wrong,'' he told <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>. `` I trusted in a system that simply did n't exist.''

The 38-year-old killer was then led by four guards a few steps from the microphone to the big oak electric chair. Four alternating jolts of 2,400 volts and 500 volts of electricity were administered over one minute. Doctors pronounced him deat at 12:14 a.m. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> died for killing Officer <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> in 1978, as <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> was being driven to jail in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> had been picked up on a drunkeness charge and apparently had not been throroughly searched. He pulled a gun from his clothes and shot three times through the front seat. Three <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> officers joined the few pro death penalty demonstrators who come to the remote prison each time the state schedules an execution. `` Justice is being done tonight,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>. `` I hate it. It took 10 years.'' Cpl. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Feconda </PERSON>, who drove <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>' widow home from the hospital after the shooting, said he is still haunted by the memory. A third officer declined to be identified. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> was captured the night of <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>' murder when a lawman's shotgun blast brought him down Scars from the blast could be seen on the lower right side of his chest as his body was examined in the electric chair. Warden <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> told reporters shortly before the execution that <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> did not desire or expect a last-minute stay of execution. At his 1980 trial, <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> asked the jury that convicted him to recommend the death penalty, `` or other deaths will result.'' But he later helped in appeals that delayed his execution for eight years. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> had enlisted in the Army at age 18 and was sent to war in 1967. The experience, he claimed, left him unable to tell right from wrong. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>'s lawyers had hoped Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> _ who took office about 12 hours before the electrocution _ would grant <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> a stay and a new Pardon Board hearing. But <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who had said last week he had no plans to delay <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>'s death, decided against stopping the execution after meeting late Monday with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Surges To Record $160.7 Billion In 1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The deficit in the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign trade surged to a record $ 160.7 billion in 1987 as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> fell deeper into debt to the rest of the world, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. The deficit in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> current account was 13.7 percent higher than the 1986 deficit of $ 141.4 billion and marked the fifth consecutive year that this trade deficit has hit a new record. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has sought to downplay the significance of the trade deficits, but private economists contend that the rapid buildup of foreign debt could eventually topple the country into another recession, triggered by a plunge in the value of the dollar. `` The increasing indebtedness of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the most insidious and potentially damaging long-run problem the country must deal with,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The current account is the broadest gauge of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s dealings with other countries because it measures not only the flow of merchandise across <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders but also the flow of services, primarily investment earnings. For 16 of the past 17 years, the country has run deficits in the merchandise trade category. But the current account was in surplus as recently as 1981 because Americans' earnings on overseas investments were enough to offset the merchandise deficits. But in this decade Americans have handed over billions of dollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods, transforming the country from the world's largest creditor to the world's largest debtor nation That means that foreigners now own more in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments than Americans hold in foreign investments. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was last a net debtor in 1914. It regained that status in 1985 with a foreign debt of $ 111.9 billion. That debt grew to $ 263.6 billion at the end of 1986. Based on Tuesday's current account statistics, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Faux </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, estimated that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign debt now totaled $ 424.2 billion, more than four times the burden of the previous debt leader, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and other administration officials have argued that the country's debt status was not a cause for alarm because the debt was still a tiny fraction of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, testifying before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, said the fact that more and more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets are being acquired by Japanese and other investors was a plus for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, providing American jobs. But private economists argue that the increase in foreign investment means that more American assets will be flowing into foreign hands in the years ahead to service the growing debt, lowering American standards of living and leaving the country increasingly vulnerable to the whims of foreign investors. `` The most profound and enduring legacy of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> period is its conversion of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from the largest creditor country in the world to the largest debtor,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>. `` As long as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has to rely on foreign financing of such magnitudes, events could at literally any moment trigger a sharp turndown in our economy.'' <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> endured two such turbulent episodes in early 1987 and again in the fall when weakened foreign confidence sent the value of the dollar plunging and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates up sharply. The last such event has been blamed as a contributing factor in the record collapse of stock pricesd which occurred on Oct. 19. The new report on the current account showed that the trade deficit actually narrowed somewhat in the final three months of the year, dropping to $ 39 billion, compared to record quarterly deficit of $ 43.4 billion in the third quarter, reflecting higher American earnings abroad because of the decline in the value of the dollar. But this improvement did little to shrink the deficit for the year, an imbalance reflecting a continued worsening in merchandise trade and a shrinking of the investment surplus. The merchandise trade deficit, on a current accounts basis, totaled $ 159.2 billion last year. Adding to that deficit were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid and other government transfer payments totaling $ 13.5 billion. The deficit was lowered slightly by a surplus of $ 12 billion in the service category. While foreigners now own more in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments, the payments still show a slight surplus in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s favor because many of the older <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments are earning a higher rate of return Economists said the $ 12 billion surplus in 1987, down from $ 18.6 billion in 1986, will shrink even more in 1988 and by 1989 will drop into a deficit, further complicating the country's efforts to reduce its trade imbalance. <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON> estimated that total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt held by foreigners would rise to around $ 700 billion to $ 800 billion by 1995, requiring net interest payments of around $ 25 billion annually.

<HEAD>NASA Study Finds Atmospheric Loss of Life-Protecting Ozone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 High-altitude ozone, which protects humans from skin cancer, shows an unexplained thinning of about 2.3 percent since 1969 over mid-latitudes of the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> _ an area that includes most of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, scientists said Tuesday. The decline, which is at least twice as large in winter at high latitudes, was almost certainly the result of human use of ozone-destroying chemicals, the researchers said in what is believed to be the most definitive report on ozone concentrations to date. Ozone, a pollutant at ground level, makes possible life on earth by blocking the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun at high altitudes. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that every 1 percent decline in ozone overhead means an eventual increase in skin cancer of 5 percent to 6 percent. Satellite data from 1978 on are consistent with a similar shrinkage in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, according to the report of a panel assembled by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The satellite data show a similar unexplained decline in ozone around the middle of the globe in both hemispheres of about 0.5 percent to 1.8 percent from 1978 to 1987. The actual decline is larger, about 2.5 percent, but most of it results from variations in the output of the sun, the panel said. `` At this point there is no other culprit to blame'' but the chlorofluorocarbon compounds, said <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, and head of a panel subcommittee. `` We have taken out all the natural phenomena that are believed to affect ozone.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday approved, 83-0, a 31-nation treaty calling for 50 percent cuts by 1998 in production of chlorofluorocarbons, which are used for refrigeration fluids, cleaning solvents and foam blowing agents. Since 1985, there have been several reports of ozone decline worldwide in addition to the well-established ozone `` hole'' over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> _ a 50 percent decline in springtime, followed by recovery. But the reports have not been widely accepted because of such problems as out-of-calibration satellite instruments or failure to account for the solar cycle. The <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> panel of more than 100 scientists, convened 17 months ago, went back to the original data, analyzing possible errors in observations, cross-checking ground and satellite observations and making particular use of ground data taken when a satellite was overhead. It particular, it tried to estimate the effect of the 11-year solar cycle, which could decrease ozone by 0.7 percent to 2.0 percent in the period in question, and the effect of the two-year cycle of upper atmosphere winds. The northern mid-latitude decline was estimated from ground-based data taken by stations mostly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. There are too few stations at high latitudes, in the tropics or in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, the panel said. The decline reached 8 percent at the highest latitudes studied in January, averaging 6 percent in winter, and at higher northern latitudes `` limited data suggest that there has been a decrease comparable in magnitude,'' the report said. The agency's computer models predicted only a 4 percent to 5 percent peak decline, and researchers are asking, `` Can we believe our models?'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman of the ozone panel. Estimated average year-round ozone declines from 1969 through 1986 were reported from ground-based data for three bands in the Northern Hemisphere: latitude 30 degrees -LRB- about the latitude of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> -RRB- to 40 degrees -LRB- <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> -RRB-, down 1.7 percent; 40 degrees to 53 degrees -LRB- <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> -RRB-, down 3.0 percent; and 53 degrees to 64 degrees -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fairbanks </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> -RRB-, down 2.3 percent. No estimate was presented for all three bands as a whole, but <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said the simple mean average of the three, a 2.3 percent decline, would be close. Each estimate contains a margin of error of about one percentage point. The satellite data were presented similarly, with a decline of 2.5 percent before corrections for solar and other fluctuations estimated for the band between 53 degrees <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and 53 degrees South -LRB- about <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arenas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> -RRB-. This band covers all of the inhabited <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION>. The Antarctic hole is so pronounced that scientists now think of it as a year-round phenomenon because of its effects elsewhere. No one knows whether a similar `` hole'' could develop over the North Pole. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said planned high-altitude research flights over the Arctic next winter will be `` absolutely essential'' in deciding whether to accelerate or change the cuts called for under the chlorofluorocarbons treaty. Declining to make policy recommendations, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said, `` A fully implemented ... treaty can do absolutely nothing to remove the ozone hole over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>,'' which scientists earlier had estimated could last 100 years.

 About 450 gallons of highly flammable and toxic chemicals found in drums along a busy road probably were the waste product of an illegal drug laboratory, authorities said Tuesday. The chemicals, which included acetone and ether, were found Monday in 10 drums about 4 miles west of this northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> town, according to <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, coordinator of emergency services and assistant fire chief for <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The chemicals, along with another 400 gallons found on two other occasions in the past two months, probably came from a laboratory making methamphetamine, commonly known as speed, in the area, he said. `` The problem with these people is they do n't take any consideration of waterways or school children waiting nearby,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. He noted there was a creek 50 feet from the drums and a school bus stop 150 yards away. There were no injuries, but <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said there was concern about the chemicals because the drums had small leaks and some of the chemicals were crystalizing and foaming.

 Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedo </PERSON> has been charged with swindling, falsifying entries in his city expense records and lying to the state auditor about how city money was spent, but he says it's a case of dirty politics. The indictment `` is not going to have an effect on City Hall,'' <PERSON> Fedo </PERSON> said at a news conference Monday, insisting that the charges are an elaborate ploy by his political enemies. The indictment, including 22 felonies, was returned Thursday by a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury and was made public after <PERSON> Fedo </PERSON>, in office nearly nine years, was arraigned Monday. The indictment includes one count of theft, one count of failure to pay over state funds, six counts of presenting false claims to a public officer or body, 13 counts of permitting false claims against the government, one count of obstructing the state auditor and one count of misconduct of a public employee. If convicted, <PERSON> Fedo </PERSON>, 37, faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on the theft charge and up to five years in prison on most of the other charges. He was freed on his own recognizance. A hearing is scheduled for May 3. <PERSON> Fedo </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauter </PERSON>, said he will move for dismissal of the charges. <PERSON> Fedo </PERSON> was `` tried once in the election and found not guilty,'' he said. Fedo, a member of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic-Farmer-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, won his first four-year term as mayor in 1979 and has been re-elected twice. The theft charge concerns $ 13,500 given to Fedo by three businessmen to lobby for state funds for a convention center in the city. During the 1987 election campaign, <PERSON> Fedo </PERSON> said he passed the funds to an unnamed Twin Cities businessman in 1985 in exchange for information about other cities' convention center proposals. <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, a city of 85,000 on the western tip of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION>, was never in competition for a $ 200 million convention center for which <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> vied, according to the charges. The Legislature awarded <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> a total of $ 17.2 million for its relatively small center. Prosecutors say the mayor played a limited role in lobbying for the convention center which he later claimed to have won almost single-handedly.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said Tuesday negotations on banning chemical weapons are stagnating, and blamed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON>, chief Soviet delegate to the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament, said some Western delegations `` unfortunately make an ever greater emphasis on the idea that allegedly there is no need to hurry, that there is a lot more work to be done.'' His reference was to recent statements by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British delegates. <PERSON> Tessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Solesby </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> responded by telling the conference: `` We have to cope with a formidable number of technical difficulties. This is why I am uneasy and my authorities are uneasy when we are told a solution lies just around the corner.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> agreed and urged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to provide more information on the size of its chemical weapons arsenal. The disarmament conference began negotiations in 1968 on a convention to bar production, stockpiling and use of chemical arms. <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON>, in a declaration he said was aimed at helping the exchange of information, claimed the Soviets have not transferred chemical arms equipment or technology to other states. `` The Soviet delegation is concerned about a slowdown, even stagnation'' of negotiations, but a draft convention could be finished this year if there is a drastic change of pace, he told reporters later. <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON> spoke of three main obstacles to an agreement: The order of destruction of weapons over a 10-year period, inspection provisions for commercial chemical plants, and mandatory inspection of weapons sites on short notice if a violation is suspected. <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON> repeated the Soviet claim that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is blocking progress by seeking exemptions for private industry.

<HEAD>Wife, Son Wish Swaggart Happy Birthday And Plead For Donations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The wife and son of disgraced evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> pleaded with television viewers Tuesday to send huge donations to keep the $ 140 million-a-year <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> afloat. `` The Holy Spirit is telling you right now to send a large gift of help to carry my word, my program and my message around the world,'' <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said on the ministry's weeklong telethon. `` Do n't walk, run to that phone'' to make a pledge, <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> urged. Tuesday's pleas were made in the third day of a scheduled weeklong telethon aimed at raising money for the ministry. Tuesday's show also coincided with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s 54th birthday. <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, often sobbing, wished his father happy birthday and pledged `` I'll never leave or forsake you.'' <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> and his mother said that unless the telethon raises enough money, some of the ministry's work in foreign countries will have to shut down. In earlier broadcasts they said that even the ministry's regular daily television show may have to stop. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> JSM </ORGANIZATION> publication that the ministries were about $ 14.7 million in deficit through February. The announcement is made in the March 1988 edition of `` The Evangelist,'' a magazine published by the ministry. In an article outlining the telethon, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> claimed expenses average $ 13 million a month. The article did not detail how the money is spent or explain how the deficit was created. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has not participated in the telethon. He voluntarily stepped down from his pulpit at the 7,500-seat Family Worship Center and his worldwide television ministry shortly after news reports of his alleged involvement with a prostitute. National leaders of the Assemblies of God denomination will decide later this month whether to discipline him for committing sexual misconduct. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has publicly confessed to his family, church and television congregation that he had committed a sin but has not publicly revealed what sin he committed. Published reports, however, have alleged that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was photographed leaving a seedy <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans-area </LOCATION> motel room with a prostitute. It also is reported that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> paid prostitutes to perform lewd acts while he watched. Since <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> stepped down, the ministry has stopped work on one of its construction projects, laid off some 100 employees and canceled at least two ministry crusades. Mrs. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and her son said record donations are crucial to keep the ministry alive. `` God is going to touch you to give the largest gift you have ever given,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said. `` The last few weeks Satan has pressed his hand down strong to destroy'' the ministries. Family Worship Center co-pastor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON> said news reports about <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> are `` not the truth. They are being sidetracked.'' He did not elaborate. In the magazine article, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> complained `` the news media is opposed to us. Most of the world's religions are opposed to us. Sometimes I think every single denomination in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is opposed to us.''

<HEAD>Hearing For Pastor, Elders Of Community Chapel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge on Tuesday made formal an order reinstating a pastor accused by church elders of adultery stemming from his exhortations to build `` spiritual connections'' through dancing with other members' spouses. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> has admitted he sinned, but says he repented and wants to remain as pastor of Community Chapel and <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Burien </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The dispute spilled into court last week, and <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> on Tuesday signed an order he issued verbally on Friday, which reinstated <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>. A week earlier, church elders `` disfellowshipped'' <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, accusing him of sexual misconduct with several women in the congregation and saying he would not follow restrictions against being alone with any female parishioner other than his wife. Church elders filed a new motion Tuesday for a more detailed restraining order, which would prevent both sides from: firing church employees; interfering with worship services scheduled by either side; authorizing expenditures except through the established system; giving keys to buildings, offices r files to unauthorized people; destroying church documents; and hiring new employees except through the established system. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> set a hearing Thursday. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, 57, founded the 1,500-member church in 1967. He has an unpublished telephone number, and could not be reached for comment. Competing services were held Sunday, and an affidavit by elder <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> said that while <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> attracted 240 and 195 people to two services, the elders' services attracted 600 and 660 people. Church spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> said a note from <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> was posted at the school chapel, reading: `` Anyone who walks in this building will be ` disfellowshipped' and staff will be fired.'' When <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> heard how many attended the elders' service, he rescinded the order, according to <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>. A former <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> draftsman, <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> guided the church from a Bible study group to an organization that once had members in this country, western <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and several other countries. Membership locally was once about 2,500. Dissident members have said many problems resulted from <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>'s preaching of `` spiritual connection,'' a relationship between church members of opposite sexes with partners other than their spouses. The members are encouraged to dance with regular partners, or `` connections.'' Some former members have said relationships that developed between these partners have led to suicide and broken marriages. More than a half-dozen former members have sued, some alleging <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> sexually assaulted them under the pretense of ministerial counseling. On March 20, 1986, a woman drowned her 5-year-old daughter in a bathtub, believing it would save the child from demons. Court records said the woman was tormented by her 18 years of involvement in the church. She was sent to an institution.

 <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON>, who became a Presbyterian minister after serving a prison term for his role in the Watergate scandal, was named Tuesday to head a mayoral commission on values and ethics. `` A lot of my time outside has been talking about these issues,'' <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON> said. `` I talk about these issues to the Kiwanises and the Rotaries around here, as well as deal with these issues through the church, so I would hope that my background would be helpful.'' Mayor <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> said the 15-member commission, on which he also will sit, will attempt to stimulate conversations on ethics. A city-wide ethics debate was prompted last year after bags of money fell from an armored truck on a downtown freeway.

<HEAD>Nation's Urban Schools Failing, Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A national summit meeting of educators, business leaders and politicians should be convened to combat low morale and high dropout rates in urban schools, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Teaching said Thursday. `` I see it as a kind of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project for urban schools,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, referring to the task force of scientists who developed the atomic bomb during World War II. <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, speaking at a news conference to release a foundation's report on the nation's big-city schools, said schools must be extricated from `` a web of mindless authority and contradictory responsibilities. `` I wonder if we do n't need a national forum ... of top educators, politicians, corporate leaders, as voices most heard and listened to,'' said <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commissioner of education. The report, the first issued by the foundation trustees, said urban schols were riddled with problems ranging from low morale and high dropout rates to dilapidated facilities and crippling bureaucratic regulations. `` The nation was challenged -LRB- by President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> -RRB- to reach for the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> within a decade and we did. And I think it's not impossible for us to dream to have inner-city schools of excellence by the year 2000,'' <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said. In the 38-page report called, `` An Imperiled Generation: Saving Urban Schools,'' the Carnegie trustees said: `` Many people have simply written off city schools as little more than human storehouses to keep young people off th streets.'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikenberry </PERSON>, foundation chairman and president of the Univeristy of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, warned: `` If people in our cities do n't believe that our students can succeed and that our schools can succeed, they wo n't support them and the problem will continue. The foundation called for a `` crusade on behalf of urban education'' including greater financial support for inner-city schools and more freedom and accountability for teachers and principals. Principals and teachers `` should be given more authority to run the schools,'' but if urban schools do not shape up, `` there must be outside intervention,'' the report said. `` It is our deep conviction that when schools fail, swift changes must be made. No other crisis _ a flood, a health epidemic, a garbage strike or even snow removal _ would be as calmly accepted without full-scale emergency intervention,'' the report said. The trustees suggested that an evaluation team of educators, parents and others be dispatched to a troubled school, where it could recommend sweeping changes including removing the principal and, as a last resort, closing the school. `` School reform is failing in the inner city because the diagnosis is wrong,'' <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said. `` Formulas for renewal _ more homework, more testing, more requirements for graduation _ work best for schools that already are succeeding and for students who are college bound. `` But to require a troubled student in an urban ghetto to take another unit in math or foreign language, without more guidance and support, is like raising a hurdle in the high jump without giving more coaching to someone who has stumbled.'' Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> issued a statement saying: `` I am generally encouraged by this report. It's good to have major figures from the education establishment strongly endorse the principle of accountability. Now let's see if agreement on this idea can be followed by the political courage required to put it into practice.'' Support for the foundation's effort also came from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the American Federation of Teachers. Carnegie surveyed teachers and visited schools in six cities: <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It proposed fighting the problem on several fronts, including: _ Setting high expectations for all students It decried the 28 percent of urban teachers surveyed by <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> who thought a 25 percent dropout rate was tolerable. _ Freeing principals and teachers `` from a system of red tape that causes them to scrounge for chalk and paper clips while bombarding them with a steady flow of procedural directives. _ A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> that would feature expanded federal funds for Head Start, child nutrition, and the Chapter 1 remedial program, as well as loans to refurbish buildings and other new aid targeted at the nation's 100 biggest cities, from <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION> -LRB- population 160,000 -RRB- to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. _ Expanded partnerships between the schools and colleges and corporations

 Opponents of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> shuttered businesses and took to the streets in six Indian states Tuesday, but the general strike failed to win widespread support. Police arrested 7,000 people in the street clashes, which left seven dead and 200 injured, news reports said. Shops and offices were closed and traffic was disrupted in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s business center, and <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, its largest city. There were few signs of support, however, for the opposition-led strike in the other 19 Indian states. It drew little apparent backing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, where most businesses remained open. The strike was called by most major opposition parties to protest sectarian violence, rising prices and alleged corruption in government. The parties, which include two communist groups, demand that <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> be dissolved and new elections held. In Parliament, proceedings were disrupted for more than an hour Tuesday when opposition members raised anti-government slogans in the upper house. Earlier, the entire opposition boycotted the first hour of business in both houses in support of the strike. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds more than 400 of 542 seats in the popularly elected lower house. The rest are divided among opposition parties which have been divided despite common demands that <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> resign. At least five people were killed in clashes in eastern <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state, according to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>. The news agency also reported that two people were killed and seven injured when a flour mill owner opened fire at opposition party supporters attacking his mill near the coastal city of <LOCATION> Ernakulam </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION> state. The agency said at least 75 people were hurt in political violence in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state. State-run television said only two people died in strike-connected violence. At least 1,500 people were arrested in central Madhya Pradesh state and another 1,000 in eastern <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> state, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. It said 14 policemen were injured near the Pakistani border in <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> state when they were pelted with stones as they tried to remove roadblacks.

 A woman who paid up to $ 200,000 to have commandos snatch her daughter from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> fears her ex-husband may try a similar tactic to get the girl back in the custody dispute, people familiar with the case said Tuesday. The woman hired retired <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commandos to help her whisk <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON>, 7, off a school bus in <LOCATION> Jerash </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, in late January, and has kept her whereabouts secret, even from her husband, since returning to this country, family members confirmed. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> now fears her husband could try a similar maneuver to get the girl back, said <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Planells </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Held </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hostage </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Brentwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> advocacy group set up to provide help in international child custody cases. `` Once you get the child back, it is n't over,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Planells </PERSON>, who has been seeking the return of her own 4-year-old son from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in a similar custody battle. Ms. <PERSON> Planells </PERSON> said she had been in contact with Ms. <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> since she and her daughter returned from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> but did not know her whereabouts other than somewhere in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> claims her ex-husband, Jordanian-born <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON>, failed to return the child to her mother after visiting last Halloween. A <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> judge gave Ms. <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> custody after her December 1980 divorce, but <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON> reportedly claims custody under Jordanian law. Ms. <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> has not divulged her whereabouts even to her current husband, <PERSON> Lytt </PERSON>, whom she married five years ago. `` The main thing is their safety and their being together and hopefully not having anything else happen,'' <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> said in an interview with the <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- News Messenger. However, <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> said he was not in favor of the commando operation, saying he felt the odds his wife and stepdaughter would be injured were too great. Ms. <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON> has talked about possible movie and book deals about the raid to bring attention to 2,500 similar cases, Ms. <PERSON> Planells </PERSON> said. An official at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> knew the group was in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, but was misled about their intentions, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The embassy officer was recalled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for questioning, he said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had expressed regrets over the officer's possible involvement in the violation of Jordanian law. Jordanian authorities have had no official comment on the case. But one official, who did not want his name used, said a Jordanian citizen was involved in getting the girl out of the country. The man, an employee of an agency that does security work for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, was held for questioning, the official said. The operation was planned and executed Jan. 28 by Corporate Training Unlimited, a <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, company that specializes in `` hostage rescue training,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday, quoting anonymous sources close to the participants. Company president <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON> denied involvement. Ms. <PERSON> Planells </PERSON> said the operation cost $ 200,000, but Ms. <PERSON> Mahone </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Niceville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said he had been told the mercenaries were paid $ 100,000 Another brother, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, confirmed reports of the rescue were generally correct. The <ORGANIZATION> Phelpses </ORGANIZATION> and their sister helped pay some of the costs of the mission, the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 An 11-year-old boy who shot and killed two men who broke into his home and tried to steal a VCR had never been left home alone before the fatal day, his mother said Tuesday. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> shot the two men with his .22 - caliber rifle Monday afternoon when they broke into his family's rural home and tried to steal a videocassette recorder, authorities <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said her son did not think he had even wounded the men and was very upset when he learned they were dead. `` I think he went to pieces after it was all over,'' she said. `` He has never been here by himself _ not even for a minute,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. She said the boy still was shaken and the family stayed home Tuesday to be with him. The boy will not be charged, officials said. `` I feel sure he felt very much as having his life in danger and I certainly look at it as being justifiable,'' said <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwood </PERSON>. `` His life was in danger, he looked for an escape and could not find one ... He was a very brave young man,'' said county Coroner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. He `` acted very wisely,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, a fifth-grade student at <ORGANIZATION> Woodruff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, was left alone in the house when his sister, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, left to practice for a weekend beauty pageant, Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> would normally have gotten off his school bus at Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>'s parents' home nearby until the rest of the family came home, but her parents were not home Monday afternoon. Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> works at a <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> insurance agency and said she left work early to minimize the time <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> would be home alone. The boy told authorities that he was watching television when he heard noises at the front door. He said he got the .22 - caliber rifle his father gave him for Christmas and loaded four A man he described as `` rough'' was pounding on the door, but the man drove away and <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> went back to watching cartoons, keeping his gun nearby. About 10 minutes later he heard banging at a dining room window. He saw two men this time; unaware of his presence, they climbed through the window. The boy went into a bathroom to climb out the window but saw the men's car parked outside. He went back to the hallway, peeked around the corner into the den and was spotted by one of the intruders as they were taking the VCR off the television set. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> fired three shots at the men, who dropped the VCR and fled through a door into the garage. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> immediately called 911 for help. Police found one of the men face down in the back yard, about 50 to 75 feet from the house, while the second man was in the driver's seat of their car, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said she and her husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, were thankful their son was unharmed but they spent most of the night awake. `` There was n't much sleeping here last night,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. `` There are so many ` what ifs.''' Dead at the scene were <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Broadus </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON>, 39, both of <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Polish Official Denies Police Clubbed Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> on Tuesday disputed reports that riot police clubbed students last week to break up marches commemorating the anniversary of campus protests 20 years ago. He said no general orders were issued for police to use force to stop the March 8 student demonstrations in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. If force was used, it was applied only sporadically when demonstrations turned violent, he added. `` I deny Western reports that police used clubs to disperse demonstrations,'' said Urban at his weekly news conference. `` Police did not have any orders to use force without necessity, without some aggression from the side of illegal demonstrators.'' The demonstrations for more academic freedom coincided with the anniversary of March 1968 student protests against censorship and political repression that were violently broken up by police and pro-government workers. The outlawed Solidarity union condemned the authorities' reaction to the March 8 demonstrations It issued a statement saying that several people were hospitalized after they were beaten by police. The labor group, in a statement drawn up at a meeting Sunday of its <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said the police action reflected `` a growth of repressive tendencies'' on the part of communist authorities. <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, heads the committee. `` So the situation of 20 years ago has been repeated, which finally puts the lie to the authorities' statements about a change of judgment of the disgraceful events of'68,'' said the statement, which was read over the telephone Tuesday by Solidarity's national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>. At Urban's news conference, Western reporters said they had seen riot police charging demonstrators and hitting them with clubs to disperse a march by several hundred students after a Mass at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Urban replied, `` You have an undoubted advantage over me ... but it's the task of police to prevent an illegal demonstration.'' The students were demanding restoration of academic freedoms won during the 1980-81 Solidarity labor upheaval and legalization of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which was outlawed under martial law in 1982. The government said police detained 83 people taking part in the student protests in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. Solidarity was chartered by the government during nationwide strikes in the fall of 1980. It was suspended in December 1981 and subsequently outlawed by Parliament.

 A couple searching for aluminum cans stumbled on a set of bleached bones in the desert northeast of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> where five young women have been found in shallow graves since September, police said Tuesday. Police were painstakinly removing the remains Tuesday and did not know the victim's age or sex or how long ago the person had been buried. The bones were found a few hundred yards southeast of where the remains of five young women were discovered last fall, said Police Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scagno </PERSON>. The women's deaths could be the work of a serial killer, said police, who have resumed searching for additional bodies. `` The body has not been removed,'' <PERSON> Scagno </PERSON> said Tuesday morning. `` We're doing it inch by inch, like we've done in the past. We hope to have it out by this evening.'' The couple found exposed bones Monday afternoon and told police, <PERSON> Scagno </PERSON> said. Scagno would not say whether clothing or a weapon were found. `` The only detail we're going to tell you is ... the body had braces -LRB- on the teeth -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Scagno </PERSON> said. `` The body itself is just skeletal remains.'' The bodies of <ORGANIZATION> Maria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casio </ORGANIZATION>, 24, and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 20, were found buried close together Sept. 4. The bodies of <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON>, 15, and <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 14, were found Oct. 20, about 200 yards away. On Nov. 3, the body of <PERSON> Angelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Frausto </PERSON>, 17, was found between the first two pairs of graves. All were El Paso residents except Ms. <PERSON> Casio </PERSON>, who was from the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Addison </PERSON>. No one has been arrested, but a detective testified in January that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> is one of several suspects. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s trial on an unrelated sexual assault charge began Monday. He is accused of an assault last summer near where the bodies were found. After two bodies were found, police used dogs and airborne infrared cameras to find the other bodies. Deputy Chief <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scagno </PERSON> said they were not surprised that their search did not turn up the sixth body. `` The dogs, of course, have difficulty, given a certain period of time a body has been out there,'' <PERSON> Scagno </PERSON> said. `` The longer the period of time, the more difficult it is to locate.'' <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said strong winds may have uncovered the bones. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> are assisting in the investigation, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs airplane circled the area Tuesday. Customs officials on Tuesday ordered a plane carrying an <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Post </ORGANIZATION> photographer to stop taking pictures and leave. <PERSON> Scagno </PERSON> said residents of <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> should be `` concerned and careful as always.'' `` Do we think at this moment that there is any need for any type of panic? The answer is no,'' he said.

<HEAD>Panel Blames Flying Instructor in 1987 Utah Commuter Plane Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An instructor's failure to keep his plane out of restricted airspace on a student training flight was the primary cause of a 1987 collision that killed 10 people in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, a federal panel concluded Tuesday. The single-engine training plane and a <ORGANIZATION> SkyWest </ORGANIZATION> commuter plane collided near <LOCATION> Kearns </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, on Jan. 15, 1987, while making an approach to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after a flight from <LOCATION> Pocatello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> absolved the air traffic controller handling the <ORGANIZATION> SkyWest </ORGANIZATION> plane. The other aircraft was flying under visual flight rules and was not under the direction of air traffic control. Nevertheless, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said the accident might have been avoided if the private aircraft had equipment that would have provided the controller information on the plane's altitude. Investigators said the single-engine <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> M-20C was on the radar screen, but without altitude information the controller would not have known the two planes were about to collide. The controller, in any case, insisted to investigators that he never saw the <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> on his screen. With a `` Mode-C'' transponder the controller's screen would have shown a larger `` data bloc,'' including altitude information that might have caused the controller to notice the plane more easily, the report said. The plane did not require such equipment, however. The safety board put the primary blame for the accident on the instructor of the private aircraft's `` lack of navigational vigilance ... which led to the unauthorized intrusion'' into the restricted airspace that surrounds the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> airport. A plane may not enter the airspace without permission from an air traffic controller. No contact was ever made between the <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> aircraft and the control tower, investigators said. The <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> had been making `` touch-and-go'' takeoffs and landings at Salt Lake Airport No. 2 near the main airport and apparently strayed into the airspace being used by commercial aircraft, investigators said. The safety board cited as another contributing factor `` the limitations of the air traffic control system to provide collision protection under the circumstances of this accident'' although it did not blame the controller specifically. The <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>'s pilot was <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and the flight instructor was <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lietz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The crew of <ORGANIZATION> SkyWest </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1834 was: Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambill </PERSON> of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, and First Officer <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <PERSON> Chubbuck </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. While the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> staff recommended in a draft report that blame be limited to the pilots of the <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>, one board member, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON>, pushed for at least some blame being directed at the air traffic control system as well. <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON>, while saying he was n't blaming the controller, said he had `` fundamental concerns'' about the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> policy that generally limits a controller's responsibilities to those aircraft that are flying under instrument flight rules under direct air traffic control <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> and several other board members suggested that the two <ORGANIZATION> SkyWest </ORGANIZATION> pilots might have been preoccupied with trying to find a <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 that also was in the area. Shortly before the accident, air traffic control advised the crew about the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, but radio transmissions showed the pilots were having trouble finding the plane, which was several miles away.

 Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and her 11 relatives received an average 4.6 percent pay raise in Tuesday's annual government budget. Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> will get the biggest increase _ 73 percent. In all, the Civil List section of the budget allocated $ 10,241,000 to the royal family. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> received $ 8.3 million. The Civil List, announced in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> by Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, gave the queen and nine other members of the royal family 4 percent raises. But 28-year-old Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s pay went from $ 92,500 to $ 159,100. The share of Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, 24, who has been receiving $ 37,000, remained unchanged. The government said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s allowance, which more than doubled after he married <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> in July 1986 and became the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, was insufficent to meet his royal expenses. Before marrying his allowance had stood unchanged since 1972. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> also earns $ 32,400 a year as a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> instructor in helicopter warfare. His new allowance pushed up the royal family's appropriation up 4.6 percent from $ 9,785,600 last year. The current inflation rate is 3.3 percent. Money Magazine last month listed the 61-year-old queen as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s richest person, estimating her personal fortune at $ 5.87 billion. Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, 87, received the second-largest sum of $ 722,050 in the budget. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>'s husband, Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, received $ 402,750. The Civil List does not include such items as running the royal yacht Britannia or royal aircraft, or money for <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, the 39-year-old heir who gave up his share to live on income from land and investments. Royal family members officiate at public ceremonies and represent <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abroad in many trips each year. Published reports have estimated that the country spends at least six times the Civil List sum on the monarchy. Staff costs account for up to 75 percent of the Civil List, Buckingham Palace said. Salaries in the royal households correspond whenever possible to their equivalents in the civil service, a spokesman said.

 Twenty-three protesters in wheelchairs and a blind person were arrested Tuesday after blocking buses during morning rush hour at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, police said. The demonstrators, members of Americans Disabled for <ORGANIZATION> Accessible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>, were protesting the appeal by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of a judge's ruling that all public transit authorities provide services for the handicapped regardless of cost. The protesters had chained themselves to the entrances of the transportation building Monday afternoon and stayed there through the night as temperatures dipped below freezing. In the morning, they wheeled themselves into the traffic, <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. `` We kept warm with the thought we were sending the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> a message that we will take any action necessary to obtain our civil rights,'' protester <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told hearing commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treanor </PERSON> after her arrest. <PERSON> Treanor </PERSON> released the protesters on $ 10 bond each, saying they could forfeit the bond in lieu of a fine. The demonstrators were charged with obstructing traffic at about 9 a.m., police said. `` It is unfortunate disabled people have to take these actions. But we'll continue to do so until the federal government acknowledges our right to use public transit,'' said <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a protester from <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> is appealing the Jan. 4 decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> which struck down the department's regulation that transit agencies spend 3 percent of their budgets on the disabled. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> called the 3 percent an `` arbitrary and capricious'' figure that was so low it denied the handicapped `` the minimum quality of service mandated by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> spoke briefly with the demonstrators Monday and offered to meet them again next week, said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON>, spokesman for the department. `` We have n't heard anything from them,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. He confirmed that the department was appealing <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>' decision but would not elaborate while the case is pending.

<TEXT>
 A group of judges that makes policy for the federal courts urged the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to consider impeaching <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, who is scheduled to go to prison for perjury on March 23. The group, the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, unanimously supported a resolution that says `` consideration of impeachment may be warranted.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, 59, sentenced to five years in prison following his 1986 perjury conviction, has remained a judge but has not been hearing cases since he was indicted in 1985. He continues to be paid his annual salary of $ 89,500. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> would forfeit his salary and his eligibility for a pension at age 65 if he is impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and removed from office by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The recommendation that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> consider impeaching him was approved by a vote of 24-0 by the judges' group. Three members abstained, including Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, who traditionally does not vote on such matters. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> has been a federal judge since 1968 and chief judge for <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s southern district since 1982. His legal problems stemmed from his business relationship with <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairchild </PERSON>, a wealthy investor who sold three oil well properties to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1980 at bargain prices. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who netted more than $ 50,000 from the deal, testified he bought the oil and gas rights in three wells for $ 9,500 in a legitimate transaction and promised no favor to Fairchild in return. He was acquitted of bribery by a federal jury, but was convicted of lying to a grand jury when he denied discussing drug charges against Fairchild's son with the elder Fairchild and with a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> prosecutor. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 19 denied <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s appeal, clearing the way for his imprisonment. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> is the third federal judge ever to be indicted for crimes allegedly committed while in office. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was acquitted of bribery in 1983 and impeachment proceedings against him are pending in the House. Former federal judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> was convicted in 1984 of failing to report $ 106,000 on his federal income tax returns and was sentenced to two years in prison.

<HEAD>Processors May Substitute Water For Fat, USDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Processors who make hotdogs, bologna and other cooked sausages soon will be allowed to make leaner products by substituting water for fat, so long as there is no loss of nutritional value, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The leaner products can be labeled as `` lite,'' `` light,'' or `` lower fat'' if they contain at least a fourth less fat than similar cooked sausage products on the market, officials said. The labels must include a comparison that explains the term. For example, the label for lower-fat hotdogs might say: `` This product contains 20 percent fat, while <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> allows 30 percent fat in meat hotdogs.'' <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the change in regulations will be effective on April 14 and `` reflects our desire to facilitate the marketing of lower-fat products.'' Current federal rules for cooked sausages limit fat to 30 percent and `` added'' water to 10 percent. The new rule will limit the combination of fat and added water to 40 percent of the product. The maximum fat content in the finished product will continue to be limited to 30 percent, but the water restriction will be removed so that processors can substitute some of the water for fat _ and wind up with a lower-fat product, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. Protein content, which is indirectly controlled by the limits on fat and added water, will remain unchanged and will be comparable to other cooked sausages, he said. The rule change is being made at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private trade association, which asked <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to develop a standard for light frankfurters and similar cooked sausages. The proposed change was announced by the agency on Nov. 25, 1986.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Bill To Expand Legal Immigration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 88-4 on Tuesday for legislation that would expand legal immigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and open the gates wider for western Europeans who once dominated the flow of foreigners to this country. The bill went to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where its future is uncertain. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> has introduced a similar bill to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure. He said there may be attempts to link the bill with proposals to extend an amnesty program for some of those who came here illegally. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rolled up its overwhelming majority because the two leading immigration authorities in the chamber, Democrat <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and Republican <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, teamed up as bipartisan sponsors. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> was the only Democrat to oppose the bill. Three Republicans voted against it: <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> took aim at a legal immigration system in which 90 percent of those granted visas are admitted because they have close family members living legally in this country. Only 10 percent of the immigration visas are granted to fill the needs of the labor market. This system has resulted in 85 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigrants coming from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. A new `` independent'' category, based on labor skills and other factors, would be expected to admit large numbers of western Europeans. The legislation would apply to those who try to obtain legal residency through normal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government channels. Sixteen months ago, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ended a six-year debate by enacting legislation to curb massive illegal entries into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 1986 law included the provision granting amnesty to those who came here illegally, but resided continuously in this country since before Jan. 1, 1982. The one-year legalization program ends May 4, and <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> and others believe it should be extended. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> agreed not to link an extension to their bill to avoid a possible filibuster led by Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation would maintain priority for applicants with close relatives here and significantly expand available visas for the new independent category. The bill also would establish an overall cap on immigration. The level for the first three years would be 590,000 annually, which is 100,000 higher than the current number of visas. Under this umbrella, 470,000 visas in each of the first three years -LRB- 440,000 thereafter -RRB- would be reserved for family immigration, and 120,000 -LRB- 150,000 after three years -RRB- would be for the new `` independent'' category. Currently, spouses and minor children of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens can enter the country without limitation. Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn., a refugee from <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said he was concerned that the limitation could someday close the doors to many wishing to come here But <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said the cap is more than adequate to handle today's applicants, and pointed out the cap could be changed every three years. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>'s bill would address this problem with a cap of 750,000, including refugees fleeing from persecution. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> cap does not include refugees, who now are admitted under a separte law that sets annual limits. The current refugee cap is 68,500. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill also would: _ Revise family preferences to give higher priority to the closest family members of citizens and permanent residents _ Require the administration to report every year on the effects of immigration, and to recommend changes in the level of immigration every three years _ Create the independent visas by combining: existing preferences for professionals, persons of exceptional merit, and those with needed skills; and establish a new 55,000-visa category based on a point system Points would be awarded for education, work experience, English language skills and age. _ Establish a conditional visa for those who will invest at least $ 2 million in this country and employ at least 10 Americans or legal residents Up to 4,800 conditional visas would be available annually, requiring the investor to return to immigration authorities in two years for adjustment to permanent resident alien status. The applicant would face deportation unless he or she continued to meet the job-creation requirement.

Soviet officials said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was `` very satisfied'' with his first two days of talks with <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> leaders and seeks ways of developing closer relations with the country <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> once denounced for `` revisionist'' policies. President <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> broke with Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1948, defying the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s authority in the communist world, and developed ties to the West. Years of plots and threats from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> followed. Relations were mended in the 1950s, with <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> in charge at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, but the last visit to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> by a Soviet leader was in 1980, when <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> attended <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s funeral. During a brief photo session Tuesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters: `` We got off to a good start.'' The two sides exchanged copies of a new declaration acknowledging <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s independence from Soviet control, which replaces similar statements issued in 1955 and 1956. A Yugoslav spokesman said the document would not be made public until the end of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit Friday. <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>, a Soviet columnist traveling with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is preparing to adopt some practices similar to those in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, among them allowing the open sale of international newspapers and magazines. `` Everybody can hear many voices'' in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I believe there will be new decisions taken in a short time'' to let <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> newstands sell non-Soviet publications. He also praised progress <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has made `` from bureaucracy to self-managing socialism.'' Public interest remained high in the visit by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>. Crowds gathered to watch the motorcade pass. When word spread Tuesday evening that the Soviet leader would stop in a downtown square, several thousand people turned up, but the stop turned out not to be on his schedule. Earlier in the day, the <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON> visited the Park of Peace to plant a tree, a customary practice. To a group of children attending the ceremony, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the park contains trees planted by many leaders of the non-aligned movement, of which <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> was a founder. `` You take care of this park,'' he said, and carefully shoveled every bit of dirt from a small pile set aside for the planting. After chatting and joking with the children, the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> lined up with them for photographs. He promised the children they would receive copies. At the <PERSON> Ivo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribar </PERSON> factory outside <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> were shown modern machine tools and robots used by auto-assembly plants in both the East and West. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met with the factory <ORGANIZATION> Worker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for plant operations. His `` perestroika'' program, designed to modernize the Soviet economy, proposes reducing central planning and giving managers and workers more control over their own factories, but he told the workers some central control will remain. `` We have to maintain a regulatory role at the center to safeguard us against mistakes, particularly because the country of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is so large,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He brushed off a reporter's question about what useful knowledge he might take back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said his schedule was too tight for questions. In a dinner toast, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` Eastern and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are gradually becoming less and less suspicious of each other.'' He criticized what he called unfounded charges in the Western media that he is trying `` to drive a wedge'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. `` I have already stated and will repeat once again: We never had, nor do we now have any such ideas,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest trading partner. It ships raw materials in exchange for manufactured goods that generally are of higher quality than those made at home. In contrast to perennial Soviet shortages of consumer goods, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s shops and markets brim with domestic and imported products. Inflation is running at about 170 percent, however, the unemployment rate is 15 percent and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has a $ 20 billion debt to foreign creditors.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Move to Expand Farm Export Subsidy Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farm lawmakers drafting a compromise trade bill agreed Tuesday to expand by more than $ 1 billion an export subsidy program designed to spur worldwide sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural commodities. `` With this action, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has demonstrated that it will continue to fight <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> subsidization and give American farmers a fair chance to compete in world trade,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said in a statement The decision to expand to $ 2.5 billion the Export Enhancement Program came at a subcommittee session of the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> that is seeking a compromise version of 1,000-page trade bills passed by both houses. Under the program, which was first established by the 1985 farm law, grain exporters are provided with government bonuses in the form of surplus commodities in return for shipping American farm goods. Proponents say the bonuses offset the difference between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prices and lower price tags abroad. But the panel put off action on the most controversial issue it faces, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan to prod the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to drop export subsidies with the threat of a so-called marketing loan program for wheat, corn and soybeans. Marketing loans represent a form of subsidy that provides producers with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> price while selling the commodities abroad at world prices. The government makes up the difference. Marketing loans established by the 1985 farm law sent exports of American cotton and rice skyrocketing while stemming a surge in honey imports. Being weighed by the panel is a so-called `` triggered marketing loan'' that would be put into effect only if current negotiations under the 92-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade failed to produce an agreement on eliminating agricultural export subsidies by the 1990 wheat marketing year. Supporters of the concept said a congressional visit to the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last week found European negotiators dug in over the subsidy issue and added that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> negotiators want the `` club'' of a triggered marketing loan to hold over the heads of their counterparts. `` If you were talking to some of the people we have to negotiate with, then you might think we need it, too,'' said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>. He said the attitude of some of the Europeans has become `` arrogant.'' Critics said however that such a plan would strain the budget. `` This is potentially a huge amount of money we're talking about in agricultural programs,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., whose export-minded home-district citrus producers have traditionally been as wary of import curbs as they have of barriers to their products overseas <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> distributed a letter signed by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. It described the triggered marketing loan as a concept that could bring about a presidential veto of the trade bill. It was designed to counter claims that American negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> are encouraging the proposal. Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., whose home district includes numerous fruit and vegetable producers, described the concept as one that could boomerang on the lawmakers politically `` I can see us passing a $ 600 million marketing loan and the administration saying on the record that they do n't want it,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said. `` We get attacked on that point and there's no mention that this was a bargaining chip for the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> negotiations. I sense that coming.'' Wheat Belt lawmakers countered that the proposal would cost the treasury nothing because it would merely serve as ammunition to hasten agreement on subsidy reductions. `` We're not asking you to take her home,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>. `` We're just asking you to dance with her Then when it's closing time, you can go out the back door.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> imposed a travel ban Tuesday, one of several moves a moderate Arab mayor said would increase bitterness and hatred in the occupied lands. Hospital officials said soldiers killed two Arabs and wounded 12. The military administration also cut telephone lines connecting the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> with foreign countries, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said the measure apparently was to prevent `` <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from passing orders to residents of the territories.'' The military command declined to comment on the reason for the action, saying only that the army `` is taking different steps to treat problems in the territories.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 96 Palestinians have been killed since violence began Dec. 8 in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupied during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, three from the effects of tear gas and the rest from gunfire or beatings. As the ban on travel between the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> took effect, <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> began a two-day general strike that kept most of the 110,000 who work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> away from their jobs. The travel ban is one of several restrictions <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hopes will reduce the underground <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership's success in running strikes and forcing the resignations of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> police and tax collectors. Others include a nightly five-hour curfew on the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s 650,000 residents and selectively cutting off electricity as punishment `` What is the result? More bitterness, more hatred, more friction between the two peoples,'' said <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, a Palestinian Christian who is mayor of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town where <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was born. `` The Israelis have to realize that after 100 days of uprising, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> do n't want the occupation,'' <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> said. `` If they keep rejecting our demands the unrest will go on.'' <PERSON> Hashem </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawa </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, said the latest measures could hamper <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s ability to export citrus, its major earner of hard currency. Half the territory's 52,118 tons of citrus exports last year went to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> bridges. `` The economy is in a very bad situation. Merchants can not meet their obligations,'' he said, adding that the bank's depositors wrote $ 10 million worth of bad checks last month. An official in the army-run territorial administration said the travel ban was designed to keep agitators and anti-Israeli leaflets from moving freely between the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The latest strike coincided with Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Underground leaflet No. 10, said the strike slogan was: `` No alternative to an independent state led by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, our sole respresentative.'' A campaign inspired by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> caused hundreds of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> police to resign. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said Tuesday that 500 officers had quit, 300 of them in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but added that 40 later returned to work. Police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said seven Arab officers in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> turned in their badges Tuesday, the first resignations in the holy city. <PERSON> Hamza </PERSON> <PERSON> Turkmani </PERSON>, the Israeli-appointed mayor of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said he had threatened to shut down the municipal government and services if Israeli authorities withheld power or other utilities from residents. He said the Israeli army cut power Monday to the <LOCATION> Shati </LOCATION> refugee camp next to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as punishment for a demonstration. `` The Israelis cut the electricity because they want to show everybody that they need the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Turkmani </PERSON> declared. Army spokesmen said soldiers shot one Palestinian dead in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarir </PERSON> and wounded four in a separate clashes in <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>. Hospital officials said two Arabs were killed and 12 wounded in street battles that swept the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Among those wounded Tuesday were <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON> <PERSON> Muklad </PERSON>, 50, shot in the leg, and his sons, <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON>, 20, who was shot in the stomach, and <PERSON> Rasfat </PERSON>, 22, with a bullet in the back. Both young men were in serious condition, said officials at <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> hospital. The army said Tuesday a military judge sentenced two soldiers Monday after they were convicted in the brutal beating of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> detainees photographed by a CBS News crew Feb. 25. A spokesman said <PERSON> Ronnen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasson </PERSON> was sentenced to 21 days in jail and <PERSON> Arieh </PERSON> <PERSON> Moalem </PERSON> to 10 days, minus four days spent in detention. Two other soldiers and their commanding officer face more serious penalties if convicted. According to the army, an investigation showed <PERSON> Moalem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sasson </PERSON> played a relatively minor part in the beating.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Tuesday he was unable to bridge differences with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> over a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for opening <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace negotiations by May 1. But he called the first of three days of talks with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> constructive and said `` we feel encouraged to continue our efforts to work with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and others in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> underscored one of the main differences. He said that in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s view, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> wants to convene next month to set the stage for negotiations could not play `` any positive role.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought, meanwhile, to reassure <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> he would not be put under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to agree to any particular solution to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40-year dispute with the Arabs. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stressed that `` making progress toward peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> not only serves mutual interests, it is urgent.'' In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>, the president said he would tell <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that `` peace will not be imposed by us or anyone else.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for about three hours, first over blueberry pancakes at the secretary's home in suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and then at his <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office. `` We have n't found our way to bridge all of the differences,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said afterward. `` I see quite clearly what the nature of the differences are and what they are n't.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not offer any details, but <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> restated his opposition to an international forum that would include the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which do not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and usually support Arab positions. `` We are interested, first of all, to negotiate directly with all the parties concerned,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. `` We do n't see any positive role for an international conference.'' The prime minister described his first round with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> as `` very serious and thorough.'' He pledged to cooperate `` to get peace and to enhance the prospects for peace in our area.'' But, he added, the Arabs were not willing to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for an international conference was `` a sticking point that has to be resolved if we are going to go ahead.'' King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> has demanded the conference. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> sees it as `` an instrument which would be used by the enemies of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, both <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> and non-Arabs, like countries that do not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to put pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to try to bring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to agree to solutions it would not agree to in free negotiations.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> offered last October to hold Israeli-Jordanian negotiations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet `` blessing.'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> stands by the offer even though it was rejected by the king. The Israeli spokesman said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did not give <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` an answer'' to the overall proposal for negotiations. `` He did not say yes, he did not say no,'' he said. Speaking a half-mile away, at the Old Executive Office Building next to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he would tell <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> that `` when it comes to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not a bargainer or a broker; the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a friend and an ally.'' The president offered assurances to the Jewish gathering that `` we will not leave <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stand alone, nor will we acquiesce in any effort to gang up on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' He added: `` Peace will not be imposed by us or by anyone else. It will and must come from the genuine give-and-take of negotiations. That's what we're working to set in motion now.'' In a meeting with a small group of senators at the Capitol, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted as saying he was not ruling out any issue or proposal as the subject for negotiations. `` The prime minister said there is nothing that is off the table in terms of negotiations,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, D-N.J. <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was asked whether he was ruling out trading territory for peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations. `` I did n't hear anything that said territory is excluded,'' <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> said he got the impression that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would be prepared to be `` a lot more flexible'' in direct talks with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states than he is in `` this pre-negotiation period.'' But he added: `` I do n't think the prime minister's obstinancy about an international conference is any less than it was earlier.'' He said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> indicated he might be able to accept `` a ceremonial group'' of other nations at the opening of discussions. `` But once serious discussions started he wanted to talk only to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s -LRB- Arab -RRB- neighbors,'' the senator said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> set this week as a deadline for a reply from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, which would form a delegation with Palestinians for the negotiations. In <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, a senior <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was not yet ready to give a final response to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan `` We are consulting with other Arab leaders,'' said the official, who demanded anonymity. Asked when he expected the Jordanian stand to be announced, he said: `` In the next 10 days or so.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> sought to reassure supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that an international conference would not dictate solutions to any side. `` We wo n't tolerate efforts _ such as ones by the Soviets or the Syrians _ to turn this into an authoritative, plenipotentiary forum,'' he told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs subcommittee <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the administration still has questions about the terms under which the Soviets could participate in such a forum, and these would be discussed next week when Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Pressed by several congressmen why <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had softened his opposition to Soviet participation, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said no Arab state would enter peace talks without a Soviet presence. `` They're -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- in the region, and we have to find a way to deal with them,'' he said. Meanwhile, nine senators made public the text of a letter to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> urging him not to subject <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to U. S criticism or pressure. American support should not be used `` as a lever to force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leaders to adopt a policy which they see as dangerous to the national security of their country _ especially when such policy entails injecting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the peace process,'' the letter said. The letter was signed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. Chic Hecht, R-Nev.; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, R-Neb; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Colo </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, R-S; and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, R-Mo. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan for peace talks anticipates <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> relinquishing at least part of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> it has held since the 1967 Six-Day War in exchange for Arab recognition of the Jewish state. In a tough speech Monday night to another <ORGANIZATION> UJA </ORGANIZATION> group, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said yielding territory would invite another attempt by the Arabs to destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` These matters are questions of life and death, of our very existence,'' he said. Also on <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s schedule Tuesday were meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, Republican presidential aspirant <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and congressional leaders.

<HEAD>Congressman Wants IRS Statement To Taxpayers On National Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman proposed on Tuesday a bill to require the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to send taxpayers a `` credit card statement'' highlighting the cost of federal deficit spending. Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who is a certified public accountant, would require the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to put the national balance sheet in the format of an individual's regular monthly credit bill. The statement would be mailed with the government's annual income tax forms. `` And I am sorry to report that the bottom line is that the average American owes Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> $ 18,569.10 from all the unpaid bills we have allowed to pile up,'' he said. The national debt is about $ 2.5 trillion. <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>'s sample statement for fiscal 1987 includes the previous balance of $ 17,118.08. It then details the purchases ranging from $ 2,769.34 per taxpayer toward Social Security to $ 73.60 for criminal justice. It then subtracts payments _ taxes _ and adds in the debt's finance charge of $ 1,358,03 per taxpayer <PERSON> Ari </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischer </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> DioGuardi </PERSON>, said the congressman had not determined how much producing and mailing the annual statement would add to government spending. But it would be minimized by including it with the other tax forms, he said.

<TEXT>
 A South African military plane landed Tuesday in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> and released 12 Angolan soldiers in exchange for the bodies of two South African corporals killed in northern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1985, Angolan officials said. They also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> was expected to arrive in this Angolan capital by Wednesday for talks with Angolan leaders following his meetings in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on a southern African peace settlement with South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. The officials, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said Tuesday's exchange took place at <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. They said 12 Angolan soldiers were freed. The South African military said 12 captured Angolans were freed, but refused to say if they were soldiers or civilians. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> identified the two dead soldiers as Cpls. <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Breda </PERSON>, both 25. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> said they were killed in <LOCATION> Cabinda </LOCATION> province May 21, 1985, when Angolan troops surprised their commando unit outside an oil depot. The unit leader, Maj. <PERSON> Wynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Toit </PERSON>, was captured. He said the commandos were sent to blow up the depot belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Cabinda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Toit </PERSON> was exchanged last September for 133 Angolan soldiers reportedly captured by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the South African-backed rebel movement known as <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. The Tuesday exchange appeared to be a further step in intense diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement in Marxist <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s 13-year conflict <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, which also is supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is fighting to force the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> - and Soviet-backed government to share power The talks Monday between <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> focused on efforts for an agreement on withdrawal of an estimated 40,000 Cuban soldiers stationed in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> is trying to negotiate a withdrawal of the Cubans in return for South African withdrawal from neighboring <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> administers <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> under a post-World War I mandate from the defunct League of Nations and has rejected <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>'s resolutions demanding that the territory be independent. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> recently acknowledged having troops in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, but said they were in the process of withdrawing. However, President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was quoted in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Monday as saying South African troops would not leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> unless Cuban troops also left. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> says it will send the <LOCATION> Cubans </LOCATION> home only when <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> pulls its troops out of southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> halts aid for <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and an independence settlement is reached for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> says 9,000 South African soldiers are in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday in a statement distributed in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, that its guerrillas captured the town of Kiwaba-N ` zogi in northern <LOCATION> Malange </LOCATION> province, killing 12 soldiers and seizing It said guerrillas attacked the town 42 miles north of the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Malange </LOCATION> on Sunday. The rebels said they also captured three Angolan soldiers and destroyed five trucks in an attack Saturday on a military convoy in <LOCATION> Malange </LOCATION> province. They claimed to have killed 10 Angolan soldiers in an attack on an army post at <LOCATION> Elola </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Huila </LOCATION> province, but did not say when. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> gave rebel casualties in the clashes as three killed and eight wounded. There was no independent confirmation of the claims.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, trying to avoid another Iran-Contra affair, voted 71-19 approval Tuesday of a bill requiring a president to tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about all covert operations within 48 hours after the action begins. The decision came after the Democratic-controlled chamber voted overwhelmingly to invoke cloture and end an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> conservatives to block final action on the measure. The chamber also voted down, 60-32, a move to permit up to 10 days, instead of 48 hours, for notification. The House is considering a similar bill, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has threatened to veto the legislation because he argues that it is an unconstitutional restriction on his authority in the foreign policy field. The bill overhauls procedures for informing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about intelligence activities. The most controversial provision was the one requiring that <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> be told about covert operations within 48 hours after they begin. The bill was chiefly written by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and also a member of the committee which last summer investigated the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> withheld notice from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> for 10 months that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms were secretly being sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Some of the money was diverted to the anti-Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas. Current law requires only that the president give `` timely notice'' to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> about covert action, but does not define the term. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and other backers of the legislation have argued that had <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the planned sale of weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the legislators might have complained so loudly that the deal would have been scuttled. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the 48-hour time period was suggested by intelligence officials, who said it could be met. As it returned to the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 73-18 to limit debate. That was 13 more votes than needed to invoke cloture and halt the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> practice of unlimited debate. Then, the chamber killed, by a 60-32 margin, an amendment proposed by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, to extend to up to 10 days the period during which information about covert actions can be withheld. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> said, `` I think this is a sufficient time'' for the completion of covert actions such as a hostage rescue, but it would block anything like the Iran-Contra situation. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is considering a similar bill, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has already decided to veto any such legislation because he believes it is an unconstitutional restriction on his authority to conduct foreign policy, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said last week. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> took over as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair. Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, R-Wyo., told his colleagues Tuesday that `` this bill is badly drafted, badly conceived, and the worst of its conceptions is that somehow you can legislate intelligence ... It's hard for me to believe that one piece of legislation can obviate stupid activity.'' If the measure passes, `` we can perhaps prevent another Iran-Contra,'' said <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, but `` we would deny some very wholesome activity.'' Wallop claimed that the bill `` would substitute our judgment for that of the president.'' But <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, `` nothing could be further from the truth'' and argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` should not abdicate its constitutional responsibility.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is a `` co-equal'' to the White House and should shoulder the burden of overseeing actions by the intelligence agencies, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> photographer has been accused by the army of throwing stones at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers during a violent Palestinian protest in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The army on Tuesday identified the photographer as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggart </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said he had been on assignment for the <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, a weekly newspaper published in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Biggart </PERSON> and the newspaper denied the army allegations. <PERSON> Biggart </PERSON> was detained last week during a Palestinian riot in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest Arab town, the army said. A spokesman said the photographer was wearing a traditional checkered Arab headdress and was seen throwing stones at soldiers. The army filed a complaint with <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> police, the spokesman said, refusing to let his name be used because of military regulations. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Biggart </PERSON> apparently went to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to see if he could take pictures to sell to other news organizations. `` He's a free-lance photographer on assignment from us to take some very routine head-and-shoulder shots and real estate pictures of the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the Israeli Parliament -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said. `` He adamantly denies the charges. Our position here is one of outrage. We think that although he was n't specifically working for us on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, we would have been anxious to see the photos he took.'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> quoted the photographer as saying: `` It's ridiculous. I'm 40 years old. I have three kids. I did n't come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to thrown stones.'' `` We think he did absolutely nothing wrong and one can only wonder why <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers would concoct charges against this man at a time when every effort is being made to keep the area closed to the press,'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said. `` The democratic freedom of the press seem to be under a severe attack in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' He said the paper would lodge a protest with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said soldiers confiscated <PERSON> Biggart </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport and Israeli-issued press card but a senior officer ordered the passport returned. It said <PERSON> Biggart </PERSON> described himself as a staff photographer for the Village Voice. <PERSON> Biggart </PERSON> had applied twice for an <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> card, once with a beard and the second time clean-shaven, the radio said, and quoted the photographer as saying he `` did not want to look like a Jewish settler.'' It said a policeman went to the American Colony Hotel in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Biggert </PERSON> was staying, last Saturday and presented a summons for a court appearance the next day but <PERSON> Biggart </PERSON> left the country Sunday. A senior official at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate said <PERSON> Biggart </PERSON> was in touch with a duty officer Saturday night and `` said that he was summoned to court and that he was due to leave on Sunday. The officer said he ca n't give a legal advice.'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said <PERSON> Biggart </PERSON> gave this description of events: On March 7, he was on a street in the Balata Refugee camp when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers began lobbing tear gas grenades. The soldiers later charged into the street. `` Like everybody else on the street, I began to run. I slipped. I was the only one who did n't get away.'' After an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier struck him on the legs and ripped the film out of his camera, an officer took him to a military post and accused him of throwing rocks. His passport was returned but the soldiers kept the press card. He was presented with a document, written in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>, by a police officer who spoke only Arabic. He left <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Sunday after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate official told him he could leave the country but might have trouble returning.

 From 1975 on, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> deceived federal agencies into believing it was a minority-controlled business that qualified for no-bid government contracts, a former company executive testified Tuesday at the racketeering trial of Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, one of four ex-Wedtech officials who have pleaded guilty to bribery and other state and federal charges, was the first prosecution witness to testify at the trial of <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and six co-defendants. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, a 10-term Bronx Democrat; his eldest son; his former law partner; and four others are charged with turning <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> into a racketeering enterprise that paid millions of dollars in bribes to win government contracts. Since the allegations became public, the company has filed for protection under bankruptcy laws and suspended most operations. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, who is cooperating with the government in return for leniency, also described <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s lobbying efforts on <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s behalf in 1980 when the company was trying to win an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> contract to build small engines Prosecutors have charged that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> grew from a small <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> machine shop into a $ 100 million-a-year government contractor, in part, by falsely portraying itself as minority-controlled, in order to qualify for a <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> program that gave out government contracts without competitive bidding. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said he met <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> co-founders <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> in 1976 when he served as consultant for a local program that assisted small minority-owned businesses. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said the pair later told him that <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>, who is of Hispanic descent, owned two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, then known as <ORGANIZATION> Welbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> owned the other third. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> is one of those on trial with <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> is one of the four ex-Wedtech officials cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty to state and federal charges. In 1979, <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> testified, <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> `` told me they each owned 50 percent of the company'' and that they had a `` handshake agreement'' dating back to 1975. But the pair did not reveal that <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> no longer controlled the company in records presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> `` in order to comply with the ... regulations,'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said. The witness also said that in 1979, the company had gross revenues of $ 1.5 million and about 60 employees but by the following year `` the company was going bankrupt any minute'' because of a scarcity of funds. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was in line to get more than $ 4 million in loans through the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in January 1980, but the loan approval was bottlenecked by an overworked EDA official in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` We looked for assistance from several people,'' said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, adding that it came from <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s former law partner and current co-defendant, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, who took <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> to seek the congressman. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> turned the matter over to an aide who knew the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> EDA </ORGANIZATION> official's boss and a month later <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> had the loans approved, said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> also tried to win an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> contract through the minority business program. The contract was for small, gasoline-powered engines even though <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> had neither the experience or facilities to build the engines. When the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> turned down <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s first proposal as too high, company officials again went to <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON> for help, said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> enlisted the help of Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and the late Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Addabbo </PERSON>, a powerful <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, who wrote the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, which eventually got the contract. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> was scheduled to returned to the stand Wednesday.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> lashed out at the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> again Tuesday, accusing it of wasting time on an arms embargo proposal instead of ending the deadly missile duel between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is responsible for every drop of blood of Iranian people, innocent civilians who are the victims of inhuman attacks,'' said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> spoke at a news conference after delivering a protest to Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that accused the council of taking no action to stop the surface-to-surface missile attacks on the Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capitals known as the `` war of the cities.'' The most recent phase of the duel began in late February. After a two day halt, it started again Monday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> both claim hundreds of civilian casualties. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> blamed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for encouraging the attacks on cities by pushing for a worldwide arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The embargo would punish <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for failing to honor the council's July 20 resolution demanding a cease-fire and withdrawal to pre-war boundaries as the first step in a negotiated end to the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> told reporters that questions about <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s position on the resolution are `` outdated questions.'' Instead, he said, the council should condemn <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for starting the latest round in the `` war of the cities'' and take action to stop the attacks. He also accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons and intensifying attacks on neutral shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> would not say precisely what <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants the council to do other than condemn <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and stop talking about an embargo. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> blames <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for starting the missile duel that has killed scores of civilians since Feb. 29. Both sides describe their attacks as retaliatory and defensive. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> increased its pressure for an embargo after <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> ended months of negotiations late last year proclaiming frustration at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s recalcitrance. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which wants better relations with neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, has not agreed to support an embargo. Last week the Soviets called for more negotiations and a new <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution dealing only with the attacks on cities. The Soviets acknowledged Monday that they had failed to win council support for that plan.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> blasted each other's cities Tuesday with missiles, bombs and artillery in apparent attempts to terrorize each other into submission in a new `` war of the cities.'' Communiques from both sides, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, reported scores of civilians killed or wounded in the third straight day of new attacks on population centers. `` We are determined to turn <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> into a hell, the like of which the barbaric scoundrels have never seen before,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> following another barrage of missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Persian Gulf shipping executives said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes attacked a Liberian-flag tanker, chartered by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, off the Iranian coast. They had no details on casualties or damage aboard the 249,223-ton Trade Fortitude, the second ship damaged in <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> raids in the gulf since March 8. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has long held the technological edge in the deadly duel, said it fired six long-range missiles Tuesday into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the Iranian capital, while its air force bombed seven cities in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it bombarded the southern <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Nashwa </PERSON>, 12 miles to the north, with 11 short-range missiles and artillery fire and hit four other cities in the <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> and southeast with air raids. The Iranians reported no long-range missile attacks on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital, or any other cities. The absence of any missile attack on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> prompted speculation that the Iranians may have exhausted their arsenal of long-range missiles in an exchange with the Iraqis that began Feb. 29 and ended for two days last Friday. So far, the Iraqis have reported shooting 86 long-range missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and other Iranian cities in the last 16 days. In contrast, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has claimed to have fired 31 in that period. In the gulf, the Kuwaiti tanker <PERSON> Gas </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, one of 11 <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> tankers reflagged with the Stars and Stripes to afford them <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> protection from Iranian attack, sailed northward in the 17th convoy operation this year. The convoy was the 39th since July, when the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> began escorting the Kuwaiti tankers. In <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, foreign ministers of six conservative Gulf Arab states met to discuss the Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said a number of civilians were killed in missile attacks on residential areas of the capital, but did not say how many rockets hit the city of 6 million. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also reported civilian casualties in several cities, but gave no figures beyond nine killed and 20 wounded in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. AP reporter <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrawi </PERSON> reported from <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> on Tuesday that the city was rocked throughout the day by exploding artillery shells and Soviet-made Katyusha rockets fired by Iranian forces east of the city. Iranian Revolutionary Guards battled to within six miles of the city a year ago in a major offensive and have held onto their bridgehead despite Iraqi counter-attacks. <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>'s governor, <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Hadithi </PERSON>, said that more than 2,900 shells and nearly 200 rockets have hit the city since Feb. 28, killing 50 civilians and wounding around 250 others. `` The Katyushas are the worst,'' <PERSON> al-Hadithi </PERSON> said. `` The Iranians use truck-mounted launchers which means they can fire and run before our people can locate them. The shrapnel bursts from the rockets is worse than the shells and they kill more people.'' <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> was once <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s second largest city. But its pre-war population of 1 million has dwindled to around 300,000 in the last two years as people fled the Iranian bombardment. Western military analysts believe <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, which began hitting <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> with missiles for the first time Feb. 29, wants to provoke <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into retaliation that will intensify pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to impose an arms embargo on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Western diplomats believe the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> strategy is ill-advised because it has provided the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with an excuse to stall on swinging behind <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to secure the embargo. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main arms supplier, but has been at pains in the last two years to improve its relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in an apparent effort to mediate a cease-fire in the war. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Soviets' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON>, acknowledged Monday that the Soviet bid for a resolution calling for an end to the `` war of the cities'' had failed. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> saw the proposal as a maneuver designed to deflect attention from the American drive for the embargo on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. And <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy lashed out at the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, accusing it of `` wasting'' time on the arms embargo proposal instead of ending the missile duel between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is responsible for every drop of blood of Iranian people, innocent civilians who are the victims of inhuman attacks,'' said the envoy, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>.

 Two Roman Catholics were shot dead and hearses bearing the coffins of three <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas were pelted with stones by jeering Protestants, police said Tuesday. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrillan </PERSON> was gunned down from a motorcycle outside a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> supermarket as he arrived for work Tuesday, police said. His death bore the hallmarks of a sectarian murder by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> terrorists, they said. The night before, police said, troops shot a gunman who fired on an army patrol near the <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> home of one of the dead guerrillas. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, 33, who had a record of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> activity, died later in the hospital. The three guerrillas, killed in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> March 6 by a British anti-terrorism squad as they were planning a car bombing, were to be buried Wednesday in the biggest such funeral since 1981, when 10 guerrillas died in prison hunger strikes. Catholic sympathy for <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30, is heightened by the fact that they were unarmed, and the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government has protested they should n't have been killed. The Rev. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, chaplain of the Armagh Jail where Miss <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> spent 10 years on a bombing charge, denounced the killings at a Mass for her Tuesday night in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. `` She was done to death, barbarously assaulted by a gunman as she walked in public on a sunny Sunday afternoon,'' he told 2,000 people crowded into a Catholic church. The three bodies were flown from <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> on Monday and driven for nine hours in a cortege to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, 100 miles north. Thousands of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> sympathizers waved black flags of mourning along highway, while at six points along the 40-mile <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> segment of the route, the three hearses were stoned and jeered by Protestants to whom the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is a mortal enemy. At the Ireland-Ulster border, the procession ran into <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> police demanding the removal of Irish flags draped over the coffins. After 30 minutes of argument the mourners compromised by folding the flags, replacing them on the coffins and covering them in wreathes. The tricolor, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s national flag, is identified in most Protestant minds with the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, said police tried to break up the cortege and twice crashed a vehicle into a hearse. At <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION>, five miles inside <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, the hearses were paraded around the largely Catholic town for two hours in front of cheering <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters. On <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION>'s outskirts, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> crowds jeered, waved <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> flags and hurled bricks, bottles and stones at the cortege, breaking some car windows. Similar scenes repeated themselves along the road to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. On Monday the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said its members fired a volley over a makeshift shrine in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> as a farewell salute to the guerrillas. The traditional paramilitary salute, which is banned in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> as an illegal display of firearms, was fired Monday as the bodies landed in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement issued through <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>. The Royal <PERSON> Ulster </PERSON> <PERSON> Constabulary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force, promised in newspaper advertisements not to interfere with the funerals if the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> did not mount a gunfire salute over the coffins. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> accused the the police of partially splitting up the convoy, sending cars with relatives of the three guerrillas into mainly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lisburn </ORGANIZATION>, eight miles outside <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> where they were stoned. In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> `` hijacked the three hearses by forcing them down to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> and refused to allow the remaining relatives to accompany their loved ones.'' Police said that near <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> they separated the hearses from the rest of the slow-moving funeral procession, which had grown to several miles in length. The coffins were taken to the homes of the guerrillas' families in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. They will be buried at <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milltown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> alongside many other <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas killed in nearly 20 years of strife in the province. Since 1969, 2,630 people have died in sectarian violence. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to rid <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> of British rule and unite the province with <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 A Democratic fund-raiser on whose behalf <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> once interceded was indicted Tuesday in an alleged scheme to defraud an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> thrift institution in a land deal. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>, 48, of DeSoto, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was accused by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, of arranging for the <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleasant </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, to unwittingly finance a `` land flip'' in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> bought some 44 acres of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> land at less than 50 cents per square foot, then sold it the same day through a middleman to 22 buyers at $ 5.25 per square foot, the indictment alleged. He also was accused of denying involvement in the project and failing to disclose to S & amp; L regulators, as well as state and federal regulators, that during the transaction he was to be a buyer and a seller of the land. The real estate developer was accused of wire fraud, making false statements to a federally insured financial institution and making a false statement to the government. <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> is a prominent Democratic fund-raiser and former owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who contributed $ 7,000 to a pair of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> political committees in 1985. In the fall of 1986, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, then <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, urged <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to meet with <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> to hear his complaints about the board's treatment of Independent American At <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s urging, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> spent 2 -LCB- hours with <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he was simply encouraging <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to ensure that his agency was being fair to one of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s constituents. The S & amp; L industry in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is focus of a massive federal criminal investigative effort that has resulted in a number of indictments of prominent businessmen. <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON> has called the federal effort `` a witchunt.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> leads the nation in S & amp; L losses and failures, and federal insurance officials say fraud, inside abuse and gross mismanagement have contributed to the problem as well as the economic recession in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The maximum penalty for wire fraud is a $ 1,000 fine and five years in prison. Making false statements to a federally insured financial institution carries a maximum $ 5,000 fine and two years in prison. Making false statements to the government carries a maximum $ 10,000 fine and 10 years in prison.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff aide <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> made a 2 -LCB- - hour federal grand jury appearance Tuesday in the criminal investigation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and a proposed $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> declined to discuss his testimony following his appearance. He was the aide designated by then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> in June 1985 to work on expediting the pipeline, which was floundering for lack of an insurance package sought by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to insure it from Israeli attack. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was assigned to get the project back on track following a meeting by <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s client Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a partner in the proposed pipeline. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had referred <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> the previous month. Working with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> tried unsuccessfully to help assemble a $ 400 million bank-backed insurance package acceptable to the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The government agency insures foreign investments by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms such as <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was going to build the project. <ORGANIZATION> OPIC </ORGANIZATION> officials wanted guarantees that funds would be available from some source to cover losses if the pipeline were destroyed. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> is the second <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide in two weeks to testify in the probe of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> being conducted by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. The other was <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigg </PERSON>, who took <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s place on the project. Two former aides in <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s office, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, testified last week before the grand jury to which <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s office is presenting evidence. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s chief of staff before leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> several months ago. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, now with the solicitor general's office, worked on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s staff in mid-1985. The probe of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> revolves around whether he may have violated the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribes by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies or their agents to foreign officials. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> wrote a memo to the attorney general in September 1985 saying that a portion of up to $ 700 million from the pipeline would be paid to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> says he does n't recall reading the portion of the memo relating to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> payments. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 14, 1985, and his place on the pipeline project was taken by <PERSON> Wigg </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> on alternative proposals. Those included pledging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a guarantee for the pipeline and seeking to put <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget money for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in an overseas escrow account as insurance. None of the insurance proposals was adopted and the pipeline was n't built. On Tuesday afternoon, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> of the Pentagon office of general counsel appeared before the grand jury. <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> worked with <PERSON> Wigg </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget proposal, according to sources familiar with <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s probe, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON>, who declined comment on his testimony, is the assistant general counsel for international and intelligence matters. <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> are both witnesses in the probe rather than subjects or targets and do not have legal counsel.

 Medical workers hurled firebombs at police outside a hospital on Tuesday, joining a wave of public employees rallying against the cash-strapped government of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Sections of the capital were turned into battlegrounds as hundreds of civil servants took to the streets to demand their paychecks. Riot squads fired tear gas, water cannons and shotguns loaded with birdshot. At least a dozen people were injured. Americans became involved. _ <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ordered <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> here, to leave the country within 48 hours, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> source said The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it would ignore the directive because it was delivered by a regime not recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the legitimate authority. _ The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said Panamanian police detained three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers in the port of Colon, at the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> entrance of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, but released them several hours later The command also said it upgraded the alert status for its 10,000 personnel and 20,000 dependents. _ A photographer for the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeson </PERSON>, was among those hurt in the worst demonstration at the main <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> hospital in northern <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> A shotgun pellet pierced his cheek and chipped a tooth. <PERSON> Leeson </PERSON> was treated at the hospital's emergency room, along with at least seven othe people. Three were hit in the face by birdshot and two children were overcome by tear gas. Other slightly wounded demonstrators spurned hospital care. Medical workers hurled Molotov cocktails at police just outside the grounds of the sprawling facility and riot police responded with shotgun fire and tear gas grenades. Fumes penetrated the interior of the 500-bed hospital. `` Assassins,'' cried hospital employees. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, tyrant, your end is near!'' The complex includes the six-story hospital, a specialized clinic and administrative offices. Several miles away, in the heart of the city, police spraying diluted tear gas from a water cannon broke up a demonstration by about 300 teachers and employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Disturbances flared Monday when thousands of public employees failed to receive semimonthly paychecks. Strikes begun by teachers, telephone workers and longshoremen were joined Tuesday by employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and Finance. The government announced it would begin making at least partial salary payments Tuesday to its employees. But workers at the hospital, the treasury and education departments said they had not heard of the plan. It was not known late Tuesday how many workers actually got paid, either in full or partially. `` We were protesting peacefully because we were supposed to get paid yesterday -LRB- Monday -RRB- and we still do not know anything,'' said a nurse, who refused to give her name. `` I had to borrow money from my grandfather to come to work.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has let it be known it hopes <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s difficulties in meeting its payrolls will lead to strongman <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal as head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces. Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand juries indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last month on charges of trafficking in drugs. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denied the charges. Riot police stepped in to quell the demonstration at the Social Security hospital when workers built barricades of rubbish across a four-lane, divided highway, halting heavy morning rush-hour traffic in both directions. Firing tear gas grenades, police moved the workers back behind a heavy wire fence surrounding the hospital. Some employees, wearing surgical masks against the gas, used metal tabletops as shields to throw rocks at the police. Then some workers, mostly young men, made firebombs and hurled them at police. They used surgical gauze for wicks after pouring gasoline into empty rum bottles. Other employees were seen throwing furniture from upstairs windows of the six-story hospital. At least one policeman was struck on the head by a rock. `` This is a hospital!,'' cried a nurse. `` How can they do this! We are under siege!'' Students threw rocks at police from a university building across the highway. Treasury Minister <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said the government planned to pay workers on a sliding scale. Employees making less than $ 200 a month would get full wages. Those getting up to $ 999 would get $ 75. People making more than $ 1000 would get nothing. More than 1,000 dockworkers remained on strike at Colon and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the entrances to the the 50-mile-long <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> that links the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> oceans. The <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the walkout had not affected transit through the waterway, which handles an average 30 ships a day. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration hopes government inability to pay its workers will bring down <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who engineered the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Feb. 26 after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire him. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed new economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last Friday, including withholding $ 6.5 million in canal fees due this week. It earlier cut off all economic and military aid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Foreign and local banks have remained closed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> instructed Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> that once <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is gone, `` all funds that have been frozen in escrow will be primarily used to pay the salary of public workers, a duty that the illegimate government has been unable to accomplish.'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> refused to recognize the Feb. 26 change in government and continues to support <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. Asked Tuesday about the possibility of waiving extradition to speed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` We do want <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of there and a return to a civilian democratic government.''

<HEAD>Commission Blames Pilots for Fatal Plane Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The pilot of a Soviet jetliner that crashed killing 11 passengers allowed his co-pilot to try a difficult night landing for which he was not prepared, a government commission said Tuesday. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> published the findings of a commission that studied the crash of an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> Tu-154B at the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Krasnovodsk </LOCATION> on Jan. 18. It said prosecutors have started criminal proceedings in the case. The three-engine jet, carrying 137 passengers from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Krasnovodsk </LOCATION> and then on to <LOCATION> Ashkabad </LOCATION> was flying normally until the approach to <LOCATION> Krasnovodsk </LOCATION> in the early morning hours, the report said. Pilot V.S. Churayev permitted co-pilot V.D. <PERSON> Yegorov </PERSON> to land the plan, even though <PERSON> Yegorov </PERSON> was not trained sufficiently for landing in the difficult conditions at <LOCATION> Krasnovodsk </LOCATION>, according to the report. The report did not say why the landing in <LOCATION> Krasnovodsk </LOCATION> was difficult. It said <PERSON> Yegorov </PERSON> made mistakes in his approach that brought the plane down too rapidly from a height of 150 feet and even though <PERSON> Churayev </PERSON> took over the controls at the last minute, the plane flipped over on landing and broke in two. It was one of three times this year that passengers were killed in <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> flight crashes reported by the Soviet media. On Feb. 27 a Tupolev 134 crashed at the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Sumgut </LOCATION>. The media said there were casualties, but did not say how many. On March 8, a family musical group from <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION> tried to hijack a Tupolev 154 bound for <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. A stewardess, three passengers and five of the hijackers were killed before the plane was retaken by security officers.

<HEAD>Early Federal Strategy Would Have Singled Out Biggest Drug Rings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division said Tuesday that an early draft of a federal prosecution strategy against drugs would have targeted resources almost exclusively at the world's 150 biggest narcotics rings. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said the approach has been broadened after extensive discussions with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys so that smaller operations will be targeted in federal drug prosecutions. `` I want that dealer in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, not to be sure he wo n't be picked up in a federal undercover operation,'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said in an interview `` I do n't want people to be able to relax anywhere.'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said that when he first considered focusing exclusively on the largest drug rings, `` I ran into a little bit of a buzz saw'' from some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys. Committing `` an untoward percentage of those resources to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'' and the other major drug centers `` creates the public perception of gaps in enforcement,'' said <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. `` The bad guys are going to play hit'em where they ai n't.'' `` If we were going to be entirely logical we might say the only purpose of prosecution is to disrupt the supply'' by aiming `` at the top-most levels of supply in the world,'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said. Abandoning regions of the country would send a mixed signal that `` it's not OK to be a member of the <PERSON> Medillin </PERSON> cartel, but it is OK to be a little fish.'' Of the refinements, he said: `` Frankly, I'm happier with the compromise than I was with my own first draft.'' The prosecution strategy is one proposed piece of the federal drug-fighting effort now being mapped out by a number of agencies. The proposals, now in final form, will be presented to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for approval and will be publicly announced by early next month.

<HEAD>General Assembly Prepares to Meet Friday on PLO Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 159-nation <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is expected to ask the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to rule on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, an Arab League spokesman said Tuesday. League spokesman <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said the assembly would convene Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said it would move on or around Monday to enforce a new anti-terrorism law calling for the closure of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s mission office. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said the League will ask the assembly to take a cautious approach. He said it will not ask the assembly to suspend <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from debates on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has suggested, or to move to another country. Both would be premature, he said. `` The provocation was reckless. We do n't want to respond with recklessness,'' <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said in an interview. Scores of nations said during a special session earlier this month on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> dispute that the independence of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is at stake. The increasingly bitter confrontation has prompted some calls to move the world body to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, which Western diplomats say is unlikely. `` Nobody wants to move the headquarters,'' <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said Tuesday that preliminary studies show the cost of moving the assembly to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> would be `` excessive,'' in part because <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> facilities there are not adequate. Both the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have said closing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission would violate the 1947 treaty under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> became <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said the Arab League will not ask the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to go to federal court to fight the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should not subject itself to the jurisdiction of a domestic court. Instead, the League will ask the assembly to request a ruling from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the Hague on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the right to close down any mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, an official observer at the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> since 1974, has said it will apppear in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court only if `` dragged in,'' and then only to challenge the court's jurisdiction over a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> matter.

 A woman who claims she was a lover of Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s chief accuser testified at <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial Tuesday about the relationship despite the presiding officer's order to keep sex out of the trial Defense witness <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> told senators she was `` intimate'' with the state's top lawman, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> has testified that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> ordered him not to cooperate with an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official against a prospective grand jury witness. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> has said he did cooperate. The alleged obstruction of the death-threat probe is one of three broad charges against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> at his impeachment trial. He also is accused of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan and of misusing $ 80,000 from a state fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 63, a first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades, has not attended since the proceedings began Feb. 29. The defense has claimed it can raise <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>'s sexual activities to attack his crediblity and character, but <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> earlier ruled the issue irrelevant. Prosecuting attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckstein </PERSON> repeatedly objected Tuesday that Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>'s testimony, elicited by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>, violated <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>'s order, but she managed some comment on their relationship. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> testified she had known <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> since 1979 and had no professional relationship with him. `` Have you had a personal relationship with him?'' asked Craft. `` Intimate and personal,'' she answered in a forceful voice before a prosecutor could object. <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> has said he knew her as a DPS informant, but he was not asked about a sexual relationship. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> officer, have said publicly they are `` out to get'' <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>. Craft angrily declared Tuesday he was being prevented from `` getting at the truth'' as he asked Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> personal questions, including why she had been married six times. She said she was not married when she met <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>. `` Was he married?'' Craft asked. `` He told me he was n't,'' she said with a smile as the prosecution objected. The judge began sustaining a blizzard of prosecution objections, and Craft finally sputtered: `` Maybe I just do n't understand the rules.'' `` That may be a good statement,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> was permitted to denounce <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> as a liar. `` He's a liar. He's corrupt. He's an egomaniac and he's power-hungry,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> declared as she was asked by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyer to evaluate <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>'s `` I'm sorry, but that's the truth,'' she added softly <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> has said that <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> quit the force under strange circumstances, disappearing for about a week while on duty. He said that Mrs. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> recently had sought her husband's reinstatement with the <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> but that he had failed a psychological test House prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> accused Craft of creating a smokescreen with claims of witness-tampering to disguise that `` apparently there is no defense.'' Among Craft's allegations was the arrest of defense witness Terri Fields on Friday, the day after she testified, on an outstanding warrant charging that she failed to attend court-ordered Alcoholics Anonymous meetings following a driving-while-intoxicated conviction. She was released on $ 1,000 bond. The <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> has denied the arrest was an attempt to intimidate impeachment trial witnesses. French, in response to Craft's claim that <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> officers were intimidating witnesses, submitted an explosive affidavit from a defense witness. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Corio </PERSON> claimed that Craft spewed profanity at him, made bizarre claims about <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>'s sex life and threatened to `` tear up'' the witness if he did n't give the right answers. Craft later called those allegations `` scurrilous in the extreme. ... It's a lie.'' <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for an anti-terrorism seminar, but <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> called the alleged statements by Craft `` disgusting.'' Asked for further comment, he said, `` You ca n't print it. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately rule on a mistrial motion by Craft based on the tampering allegations, and continued the proceedings. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also made no decision Tuesday on a proposal to extend the length of the trial day by two hours to speed up the proceedings. Craft said it would be a hardship for defense attorneys and the judge indicated he felt the current schedule already is longer and more arduous than a normal trial schedule. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON> said the matter would be reconsidered later in the week. It would take a two-thirds vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. The senators could vote again and bar the governor from holding state office again. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also faces an April 21 criminal trial on the charge that he concealed the $ 350,000 loan, and a recall election is scheduled May 17.

 About 10,000 people chanting `` Democracy! Democracy!'' marched through the streets of this communist capital Tuesday and called for a free press and free elections. Police turned out in force, but took no action as protesters yelled anti-government slogans and speakers criticized the Soviet system. The throng marched several miles down <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s main boulevards, blocking traffic and waving red, white and green Hungarian flags. The unofficial protest followed a rally organized earlier in the day by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to mark the anniversary of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s abortive 1848 revolution against <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, one of this East European nation's biggest holidays `` The time is over for self-appointed governments,'' prominent dissident <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamas </PERSON> told the throng, in a reference to the nation's communist authorities. `` A modern democracy has to be created with a new constitution and free elections.'' The crowd marched to monuments of Hungarian national heroes and paid particular tribute to firebrand poet <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Petoefi </PERSON>, whose name is symbolic of resistance to foreign suppression in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Protesters chanted `` Democracy! Democracy!'' and waved banners reading, `` We want real reforms'' or `` We demand freedom of the press.'' Later Tuesday night, a crowd of about 1,500, most of them young people, gathered at the <LOCATION> Petoefi </LOCATION> monument and then moved across the <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> bridge to the <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where they repeated calls for democracy and press freedom. About 150 people then moved back to the Chain bridge, intending to return to the Petoefi monument, but witnesses said the demonstrators were dispersed by waiting riot police, who held clubs but did not hit anybody. Hours after the unofficial demonstration was over, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported that eight people, mostly dissident intellectuals, were arrested. The five-line report gave only their names. They were writer <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON>, sociologist <PERSON> Ottlia </PERSON> <PERSON> Solt </PERSON>, publisher <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Demszky </PERSON>, artist <PERSON> Tamas </PERSON> <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gado </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jenoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and two lesser known dissidents, <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Racz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Palinkas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON> later said he had been released and that he assumed the others had also been set free, but this could not be confirmed immediately. Hungarian dissidents have staged unofficial demonstrations on March 15 since 1973. Police generally have shown restraint, although dozens of officers clashed violently with protesters in 1986. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has won a reputation as a relatively liberal Soviet bloc country, although far less dissent is tolerated than in Western countries. At Tuesday's rally, groups of protesters whistled and applauded rhythmically as police vehicles passed by, but authorities did not react to what appeared to be attempts to provoke them. <PERSON> Roza </PERSON> <PERSON> Demszky </PERSON>, the wife of one of the arrested dissidents, read her husband's speech to the crowd. The Soviet system has led <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> into a crisis `` and does not show any way out,'' she said. The reforms promised by the Hungarian revolution of 1848 `` have not yet been realized in this country,'' she added. Speakers gathered at a monument to <PERSON> Lajos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kossuth </PERSON>, the leader of the 1848 revolt, to read poems by <PERSON> Petoefi </PERSON>. In the earlier official rally, a crowd of 5,000 people gathered near <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>, where the 1848 revolution first began. Communist Party speakers called for more national unity and economic progress, and laid a plaque commemorating the revolution. Small groups dressed in folk costumes sang national songs and told events of the aborted revolution. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> recently has imposed an austerity program to try to reverse economic stagnation, and its leadership is contemplating political reforms.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> communications satellite launched into a low orbit last week rocketed successfully Tuesday into a geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the Earth's equator. The satellite, <PERSON> Spacenet </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, fired its apogee kick motor, a small rocket engine, at 11:57 a.m. EST, some 90 hours after its launch Friday night by a French Ariane rocket. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> officials said the 1,562-pound Spacenet III would initiate a stabilizing spin Tuesday night. This will lock its antennae into contact with <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Once that is accomplished and verified, the satellite will deploy an array of solar power cells that provide the craft with electricity. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> engineers will conduct a series of tests of the craft and the the satellite will start operations early in April. Spacenet III provides a communications link between points in all 50 of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Clients include The Associated Press and the television groups of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>.

 All blood samples taken for routine clinical testing at 40 hospitals in 30 states now are also being tested for AIDS, the director of <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, said at a congressional hearing that `` blinded'' blood tests are being conducted at the hospitals in an effort to help determine the incidence of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and the environment, asked <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> if he was aware that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has a law that forbids AIDS testing without consent `` Then I sure am committing lots of crimes every day,'' said <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. An official with the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state committee on AIDS such certain `` blinded'' tests are legal. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said the tests were under way in hospitals in both <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said results of the testing are now being compiled and will be released to the public in two to three weeks. In the `` blinded'' tests, said <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, a portion of each routine blood sample taken at the hospitals is separated out and then tested for AIDS. He said the blood used for the AIDS testing carries no identification of the patient who provided the sample, hence the identity of the donor is `` blinded'' to the laboratory conducting the tests. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, administrative secretary to a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state committee on AIDS, said the `` blinded'' tests are legal. She said a statute passed in 1987 permits such tests for statistical purposes. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s statement came during hearings chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., into the way that the nation's AIDS research dollars are being spent <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, along with Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, all said they were experiencing difficulty in hiring scientists and other health care professionals because the federal salaries are below those offered in universities or in industry. <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON> said that the turnover among investigators is about 2 percent a year. `` We're losing some of our most outstanding people,'' he said, for reasons that involved salary, laboratory facilities and other `` complex'' reasons. He said this is particularly true of allied health workers, such as nurses, laboratory technicians and X-ray technicians. He said there is a salary differential among those workers of about 25 percent. `` They will stay through the training period and then leave for more money,'' said <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, deputy director for AIDS research at <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, said top investigators frequently receive offers to move to university or industry positions that offer a higher salary, better facilities and more laboratory personnel. `` There is a rather significant difference in salaries -LRB- between federal and private -RRB-,'' he said. `` We are constantly fighting that battle.'' <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said the outpatient clinic at the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> treated 4,500 AIDs patients during 1987 and that more and more of them are becoming critically ill and in need of intensive care. `` The staff problems will have a negative impact'' on the amount of care available at the clinics, he said. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said his agency is experiencing difficulty in recruiting personnel trained to evaluate drugs and medical issues. He said it typically takes about two years to train personnel, and they often leave the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> shortly after the training is completed in order to receive higher pay elsewhere.

 Frustrated, angry and unwilling to admit defeat, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> insisted there was a turning point out there, a state where voters would say, `` Wait a minute, we do n't want <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign was hard-pressed to identify that turnaround state. It was n't likely to happen in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, one of the states <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls home. And the Republican presidential polls do n't look promising for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` So that takes us another month and a half without a big opportunity for a victory,'' said one top <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> adviser, insisting on anonymity. Before the polls opened Tuesday in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> conceded that big state to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. With <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continuing to build his delegate lead, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was dogged by the question of how long he could or would stay in the race. When <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Tuesday night, he insisted, `` We're just going to hang in there. ... We're staying in, we're staying in. Was there a realistic chance of catching the vice president? The numbers suggested there was n't. Going into the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already had 705 of the 1,139 delegates needed for the nomination. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had 165. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would need only one-third of the 1,318 delegates still to be chosen. Obviously, if <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> started winning two-thirds of the delegates in upcoming contests, the vice president's huge lead would evaporate. But there was no sign of that happening. The Iran-Contra affair appeared to offer a bit of hope to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigating the affair, it renewed the hope within the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign that attention once again would focus on what role <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had in deliberations that led to the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and diversion of funds to the Contras. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Relations, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> referred to presidential advisers `` peddling arms to the ayatollah while others hear no evil, see no evil.'' But he later conceded that Iran-Contra was not an issue among Republicans, though he predicted it would be used against the party's nominee by the Democrats. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s frustration was apparent when he was asked why he did n't attack <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> more directly on Iran-Contra `` If I hit him, I get <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> first and then they say, oh, oh, he's out there attacking <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' he replied. Nothing so frustrates and angers <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s success in tying himself to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a president who remains enormously popular among Republicans. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commercials that show the vice president conferring with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and, in one scene, the president putting an arm over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s shoulders. `` I do n't have nearly as many pictures of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` He must have a pile six feet deep. I ca n't match him in photos. But I can match him in record.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> blew the Republican race open with his sweeping victory on Super Tuesday. But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is reluctant to give the vice president credit for accomplishing anything on his own. `` Super Tuesday was, in my view, a referendum on <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won,'' said the senator. He sees <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as someone who has `` sort of had a charmed life in politics. He's gotten quite a ways without ever doing much.'' That view may contribute to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s belief that it could all unravel for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if he can `` get people to stop and think.'' The senator admitted he has considered various tactics that might blunt the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> momentum, including borrowing one from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ naming his running mate. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tried that in 1976 when he challenged incumbent Republican President Ford. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, fighting to overcome a perception that he was too conservative, said early in the race he would name moderate Republican Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweicker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> as his running mate. It did n't work for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but as <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` When you're looking for ways to catch up, you think of maybe naming your running mate. One of the names on <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s list was former Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. He said there were others, but he did n't name them. On election day in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, with 35 delegates, is the state where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> grew up and where his father served as a senator. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> did n't look like a good state for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, said the senator's adviser Polls in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, which chooses 47 delegates in a primary on April 5, gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a big lead. Only a <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> victory in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> seemed likely to turn it around. The biggest upcoming prize is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which elects 102 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates on April 19. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already been credited with 24 of those because his backers are running unopposed in several districts. A week later, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, with 78 delegates, votes, and the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> adviser described the state as `` controlled pretty tightly'' by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Even while claiming he was going to fight on, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> showed glimpses of the political realist. He referred to candidates who do n't realize when it's time to bow out. He said, `` Now if you're out there and you've been twisting in the wind for six or eight months and you're starting to smell a little, maybe somebody has to cut the rope.''

 A Naval paymaster was found beaten and strangled Tuesday aboard the destroyer USS <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> and $ 120,000 was stolen from the ship's safe, a naval spokesman said. The officer's body was found stuffed into a sea locker in another part of the ship, said Chief Petty Officer Art <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON>. `` He was beaten up pretty bad.'' Later, officials said the victim, identified as for Lt. <PERSON> Ratish </PERSON> <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, also had been strangled. The search for <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> began when he failed to report to muster at 7:15 a.m., said <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said Tuesday evening that nobody else was known to be missing from the ship. A search of the disbursement office found the safe open and $ 120,000 in cash and an undetermined number of blank checks missing, <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON> said. Tuesday was payday for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel, who are paid the first and 15th of each month, said <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON>. `` An audit of the ship's funds is pending and alternate arrangements have been made to pay the crew,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> sheriff's investigators were working on the case, he said. <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> is the <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>'s home port. Access to the ship, which was tied in the port, is strictly controlled, said <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON>. Anyone wanting to board must pass checkpoints at the base entrance, the pier area and the ship itself. Only relatives and friends of the crew who have been previously cleared are allowed aboard the ship in port, he said. Even <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel who do not have business on the ships can not board, he said. Construction workers doing repairs can go aboard, but <PERSON> Riccio </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> had no repair work scheduled. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> refuses to comment on whether nuclear weapons are aboard a vessel, but destroyers do not ususally carry such arms.

 Nicaraguan forces, using aerial bombardment and heavy artillery, launched a major offensive Tuesday against <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels in the northern part of the country and sent troops into neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` They have overrun certain of our positions,'' said <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Palazio </PERSON>, director of the Contra's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Palazio </PERSON> estimated that about 3,500 front line Sandinista forces aided by 4,000 backup troops were involved. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, Nicaraguan officials confirmed that a `` major military offensive'' had been launched, but denied that <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> forces had penetrated into Honduran territory. The operation occurred less than a week before the rescheduled resumption of cease-fire talks and some Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> pictured it as a <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> attempt to go into the negotiations from a stronger position. One <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said initial reports suggested the Sandinistas hoped to deliver a `` knockout blow'' against the Contras. The military engagements came shortly after a 1 -LCB- - hour <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting at which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pleaded with congressional leaders for a renewal of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid to the Contras, but met an icy reception from Democrats Congressional sources, declining to be identified, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pounded the table and said, `` There are some people around this table who do n't seem to know who the bad guys are down there.'' Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' Soviet-made Antonov planes dropped 500 to 1,000-pound bombs on Contra troop concentrations He said Contra air resupply capability is extremely limited. The rebels are low on food and lack the ability to evacuate their wounded, he said. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacasa </PERSON>, another spokesman for the resistance, said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> struck at Contra positions with heavy artillery, including multiple rocket launchers. `` The situation is critical,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said earlier that preparations by government forces appeared to foreshadow `` the largest offensive we have seen the Sandinistas undertake.'' But House Democratic aides, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the offensive by Sandinista troops was merely `` business as usual'' and an attempt to `` soften up'' the Contras before the cease-fire negotiations resume. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., acknowledged that `` there is some military activity'' in the country, but declined to elaborate `` We do n't know their intentions, and they -LRB- the administration -RRB- do n't know their intentions,'' said one Democratic congressional source. Another Democratic congressional source said it was clear that the Contras are having supply problems, in part because of an administration decision to spend the last aid money on long-term truck and air delivery contracts, anticipating that a House-drafted `` humanitarian'' aid package would be approved. Instead, the package was voted down on March 3. After the White House session, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plea for a renewal of aid puzzled him. `` It does n't really seem to make total sense,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said. He said it was House Republicans, acting in concert with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who defeated a $ 30 million package of food and clothing for the rebels two weeks ago, just after their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid pipeline had run dry. He expressed `` amazement'' that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would cheer the defeat of that package, then two weeks later come to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with an urgent request for new supplies. `` I ca n't conceive of it,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, as telling congressional leaders that `` virtually all aspects'' of the Contra effort are `` in crisis and on the verge of collapse, that food for the Contra families will run out the first of April. The program is drying up and dying before our very eyes.'' In December, 1986, Honduran warplanes and artillery pounded Sandinista soldiers who mounted an incursion into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to attack Contra bases. On that occasion, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopters were brought in to ferry Honduran infantrymen to the front. At that time, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> charged that 800 to 2,500 Sandinista soldiers crossed the border and penetrated up to nine miles into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> about a week later. Since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the rebels expired Feb. 29 and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted narrowly on March 3 against a new `` humanitarian'' aid package, the Contras have fallen back toward border areas to defend supply caches, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. That means `` they can not use normal guerrilla tactics to disperse and escape superior Sandinista firepower and manpower being brought to bear on them,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he did not know the extent of any Sandinista preparations, but said he has `` earnestly implored'' the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> government to act in good faith. He said his message for the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> was: `` You are in a position of strength. Do not abuse that strength.'' <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders said they had offered to revive the $ 30 million `` humanitarian'' aid proposal they had offered on March 3, but got no immediate response from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials. They said if they were to revive the package, it would be only with the guaranteed backing of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members who opposed it the last time around. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> appeared unwilling to budge on the central issue of whether any aid package would include the right for the president, under certain conditions, to ask for and get a quick, guaranteed congressional vote on additional military aid for the rebels. `` The bottom line is ... members are not willing to vote for another expedited procedure,'' as the guaranteed vote is called, he said.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> cashed in on home-state loyalties in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Democratic presidential primary and won support even from voters who doubt he can win the nomination or the presidency, exit polls said Tuesday. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> resident, again won overwhelming support from black voters, and increased his share of the white vote to about 8 percent, three percentage points better than he did in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in 1984, polls said. `` The way I'm looking at the numbers, hometown boys do good,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst. Among Republicans, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defeated Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> among virtually all ideological and demographic groups. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> kept pace with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> only among independents who voted in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once again defeated former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> even among his most likely supporters, born-again Christians and those concerned with moral values, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> polls said. Overwhelmingly, supporters of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said their candidate had the best chance to win in November, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. But only 40 percent of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s supporters gave him the best chance, and 35 percent named <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> even though they voted for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s voters do n't think he has the best chance in November but they're voting for him anyway,'' said <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON>. `` His vote seems to be a home-state favorite vote.'' Similarly, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> found that 80 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' supporters and 60 percent of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s thought their man would win the nomination, while only 35 percent of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s voters thought he would be nominated. More <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> voters _ 39 percent _ thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> eventually would win the nomination. `` <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is a true favorite-son type candidate,'' said <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gawiser </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst. `` He has a 67 percent favorable opinion rating. They think he's doing a good job as senator.'' Though <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> finished third in the voting, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said a plurality of Democrats, 35 percent, thought he was the Democrat most likely to win the general election in November. Next was <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 27 percent; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> had 18 percent and 12 percent selected Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who is not a candidate but has refused to rule out a convention draft. About a quarter of the electorate was black, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won 91 percent of the black vote, 20 points better than in 1984, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> improved his showing among whites, but less so, winning 8 percent compared to 5 percent in 1984, <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. The racial division was so dramatic, said <PERSON> Gawiser </PERSON>, `` There are two electorates: black and white.'' The groups had somewhat different concerns. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll found that 53 percent of blacks cited unemployment as one of their two greatest concerns and 45 percent cited poverty. Unemployment also led among white concerns, at 39 percent; protecting <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> was second, cited by 29 percent. In the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vote, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll said 70 percent of the voters had selected their candidate before Super Tuesday, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won 16 of 17 states. The polls again indicated that good will toward President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had translated into support for the vice president. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said 27 percent of the Republican voters said they were born-again Protestants, and 54 percent voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to 27 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and 17 percent for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said 17 percent were white born-again Christians; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got 37 percent, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 35, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 26 percent. `` <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is not doing well among his core constituency, and he's not moving beyond it,'' <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> said. The CBS-Times poll said 21 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> voters cited traditional moral values as one of their chief concerns, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won that group with 43 percent, to 29 percent for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and 25 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` It's a very broad <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory,'' said <PERSON> Gawiser </PERSON>. `` He's solid across the board.'' The surveys were conducted by interviewing a random sample of voters as they left their polling places. The margin of sampling error for the results was about 5 points.

 Aiming for a third straight victory as the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race neared its end, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> left this Eskimo village Tuesday with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buser </PERSON> just two hours behind her. On the trail to <LOCATION> Koyuk </LOCATION>, Butcher and her 11-dog team overcame a one-hour deficit, passing <PERSON> Buser </PERSON> and building a lead of five hours by the time she reached this village, 171 miles from the finish line in <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. Butcher rested and fed her weary dogs for more than five hours, leaving at 7:43 a.m. <PERSON> Buser </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, made up time by cutting his stay in <LOCATION> Koyuk </LOCATION> short. With 12 of his 20 original dogs still in harness, he followed Butcher out at 9:55 a.m. Subzero temperatures and biting winds still hindered the leaders, and forecasters said the wind chill factor could sink to minus 70 degrees along the trail's final miles into <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. The winner is expected to cross the finish line at midmorning Wednesday. Butcher, of <LOCATION> Manley </LOCATION>, has won the last two Iditarods, each time proving the strength and endurance of her team in the final, windswept miles along the barren <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coast. She set a course record with each victory, last year burning up the trail in 11 days, 2 hours. Her closest rival last year was four-time Iditarod champion <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, who waged a neck-and-neck race with Butcher until his dogs staged a sit-down strike just 22 miles from the finish. This year, <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, of Two Rivers, about six hours behind Butcher at last report, leaving <LOCATION> Koyuk </LOCATION> at 2 p.m. in third place. Running in fourth was <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnie </PERSON> of Teller, who arrived in <LOCATION> Koyuk </LOCATION> at 11:49 a.m. <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nayokpuk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Shishmaref </LOCATION> was fifth. Seventy-year-old <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Redington </PERSON> of Knik, credited with organizing the race but never a winner, was running sixth. He had captured an early-race lead and held onto it for more than 400 miles before falling back. The 16th annual race started March 5 in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. The first musher to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> will collect $ 30,000 of a $ 150,000 purse; the next 19 finishers will split the rest. Finishers have to have at least five dogs in harness at the end of the race in order to qualify. Five of the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out.

 Nicaraguan troops launched a major offensive Tuesday against U.S.-supported rebel forces in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Leaders of the rebels, known as Contras, claimed Sandinista troops entered Honduran territory. The Sandinistas denied the claim and a <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> military spokesman in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the Honduran capital, said he had received no reports of incursions into his country's territory. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said `` the army has undertaken major offensive operations ... reports that the army has penetrated <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> are not true.'' `` The army is developing a major military offensive at this moment. We will inform you in due time,'' he added. Contra spokesmen in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> claimed that Sandinista troops had crossed into neighboring Honduran territory in pursuit of rebel forces, who have secret base camps across the border. Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Honduran armed forces, said he had no reports of Sandinista incursions. `` Nevertheless, tomorrow we will probably be able to report on the situation -LRB- along the border -RRB-,'' he said A Honduran government source, who spoke with the condition he not be identified, said President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> was watching the situation closely and a government team `` is monitoring reports on the subject.'' In a speech to celebrate Women's Day, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said on March 8 that `` the Sandinista army is on combat alert'' but gave no details at the time. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> at the time said the combat alert was in response to the Contras' refusal to join the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in cease-fire talks they had planned beginning March 9 in the small southern Nicaraguan town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said his government had information the rebels were planning to attack the Sandinista army `` at border points on the Honduran frontier.'' Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> confirmed to reporters Monday that the Sandinista army was engaged `` in actions of a certain size'' in different points in the country, but did not specify what locations were involved. The Contras' clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> claimed Tuesday there was heavy fighting for the past week in the northern 5th Military Region that includes <PERSON> Boaco </PERSON>, Chontales, <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zelaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> provinces. Sandinista military sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about 6,000 government troops were involved in what they called `` an important anti-insurgent operation.'' Contra radio claimed the Sandinista army was carrying out `` genocidal bombardments'' in <LOCATION> Chontales </LOCATION> province, dropping 500 - and 1,000-pound bombs from helicopters `` Many peasants had to flee for fear of being torn to pieces,'' the radio said. Sandinista military sources in <LOCATION> Juigalpa </LOCATION>, capital of Chontales province, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday the Sandinista army was using `` various military means, including helicopters'' to dislodge Contra rebels who had been dominating the region for months. Sandinista and Contra leaders had agreed to hold cease-fire talks, for the first time inside Nicaraguan territory, at Sapoa March 21-23. The offensive appeared to be an effort by the Sandinista regime to start negotiating from a position of strength. Other military sources in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Sandinista army `` unleashed a great offensive in the northern part of the country,'' but the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued no reports. Up until Tuesday afternoon, the ministry and military sources limited themselves to issuing `` routine'' news bulletins and other reports to keep the offensive a secret, the sources said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> leaders said Nicaraguan forces were knocking the Contras back. `` They have overrun certain of our positions,'' said <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Palazio </PERSON>, director of the Contras' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. Sandinista sources said the army sent reinforcements to <LOCATION> Chontales </LOCATION> province, where fighting appeared to be heaviest, and government troops were using helicopters and heavy artillery against the rebels. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reports Tuesday said two rebels were killed Monday near <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanco </LOCATION>, a town in northern <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION> province, where a civilian was also killed by the Contras. They said two other rebels were shot dead near the town of <LOCATION> Pancasan </LOCATION>. An additional 31 Contras were killed in scattered fighting in Chontales, <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> and the southeastern province of <ORGANIZATION> Zelaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> since Friday, the reports said. They said a rebel ambush killed seven Sandinista soldiers and wounded eight near the <LOCATION> Zelaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nueva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Senate Approves Revised Universal Health Care Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 By a wide margin, the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday approved a revised version of a universal health care bill championed by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to launch the state on an experiment in `` health care for all.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has touted the proposal in his Democratic presidential campaign as a model for the nation. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> endorsed the measure 23-11, sending the bill to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> to iron out differences with a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version that would exempt many small businesses and shower favors on certain hospitals. Sen. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> chairwoman and the chief architect of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, said she was confident a compromise could be worked out swiftly. There are an estimated 600,000 uninsured residents in the state, more than half of them working people whose employers do n't provide health benefits. Among other things, the bill would provide incentives for businesses to offer their own health insurance. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> supporters fought off repeated challenges throughout the day. In a key test, a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> effort to strip the huge health care bill of provisions guaranteeing health care protection to all <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents by 1992 was defeated by a 27-9 vote. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who championed the amendment, tried again later, offering an amendment to match the House language and exempt all businesses with nine or fewer employees. That amendment fell short on a vote of 17-19. The exemption, included in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure, has been criticized as leaving the entire program open to a challenge on the grounds that it makes the benefits mandatory for some employees and not others. The universal health care proposal has been tied to a bill renewing the state's hospital financing law, providing nearly $ 1 billion in revenue increases for the state's 106 acute-care hospitals over the next four years. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the health care bill two weeks ago, with a maximum price tag for the state of about $ 1 billion over four years to provide insurance coverage for uninsured and incentives to business to offer the benefit to employees. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has estimated the state's cost at about $ 540 million over the same period.

<HEAD>Aquino Says She Is Ready For New Talks With Moslem Insurgents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Wednesday she was prepared for new talks with Moslem insurgents as her government sought to head off a bid by the rebels for international Islamic support. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters she was willing to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and `` all Moslem leaders of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>,'' the country's second largest island and stronghold of the 5-million member Moslem community. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jali </PERSON>, a religious adviser to the liberation front, told reporters that his group would resume peace talks but threatened to establish a government-in-exile if the Aquino administration did not agree to negotiations by next week. The front, largest of three Moslem rebel groups, is expected to seek full membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> when ministers of the worldwide Moslem group meet next week in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Filipino officials have said the move would be tantamount to recognition of the front as a `` state within a state'' and full membership could lead to civil war. The front has been waging a campaign for 16 years for self-rule, but the rebellion has been largely limited to small-scale ambushes and raids. The revolt peaked in the mid-1970s after claiming more than 50,000 lives. Before Wednesday's Cabinet meeting, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she had received no formal request from the front for new talks. Negotiations broke down last May because of differences over the conditions and scope of self-rule. A former front official, <PERSON> Zacaria </PERSON> <PERSON> Candao </PERSON>, left Tuesday for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for talks with other rebel leaders. Candao, governor of <LOCATION> Maguindanao </LOCATION> province, said he would seek a meeting with Secretary-General <PERSON> Shariffudin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirzada </PERSON> of the Islamic organization to discourage full front membership in the organization. Meanwhile, a rival Moslem rebel group announced it also was seeking full membership in the Islamic group. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> told reporters in <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> that their organization was more stable than the <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Last April, the <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> organized a series of attacks across central <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> to protest the decision of the government to hold talks only with the <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tried to put the best face on a third-place finish in the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary Tuesday night, saying `` it's not a setback because we ran against two favorite sons.'' After numerous questions about whether his showing in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was a disappointment, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was making no predictions about the next big contest, the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democratic caucuses on March 26. `` I do n't believe we have any front-runners, I do n't think we're going to have a front-runner until the convention,'' he said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he did n't think the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> results increased the chances of a brokered convention. `` I've been making a number of calls around the country to key Democrats, and there is an overwhelming sentiment that we should get behind a nominee,'' he said. Illinois Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took first and second respectively in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary, leaving <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> third in the popular vote. `` It's not a setback, because we ran against two favorite sons who started off with a lead and stayed there,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We did what I can characterize was a respectable third.'' The seven days between Super Tuesday and the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary left <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> too little time to attract strong support in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said at a news conference at a local television station. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent $ 246,000 in media advertising in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. During the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had said a vote for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> would increase the chances of a brokered <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, something he said would be a `` disaster.'' But Tuesday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had spent the days on the telephone with congressmen, senators and other leading Democrats, and most told him they favored a decision by the voters, not by convention negotiators. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' demeanor was in marked contrast to his gala celebration the night of Super Tuesday, when he won the most delegates and the most states. Smiling tightly, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said with apparent relief: `` Now, we move on to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where there are no favorite sons. The field is wide open.''

<HEAD>Getting the Down Payment</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

 Once a young couple obtains the down payment for a house, the cost of operating it may be no more than might be needed for rent and maintenance of an apartment. Moreover, the benefits of homeownership are great. Owners become member of the elite tax-privileged class, since mortgage interest and real estate taxes are deductions on federal income tax returns. They build equity. And their house is a good hedge against inflation. It is for such reasons, and several more, that suggestions are now pouring into <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on ways to help young folks get a financial foot in the door of their own house. What they seek, in effect, is government sponsorship. This would n't be the first time that government provided such assistance, of course, but in recent years it has indicated a desire to reduce, not add to, its programs. But, say proponents of aid, there are special factors today. Indeed there are. First on the list is the down payment. Housing prices have risen sharply in recent years, far outperforming the after-tax paychecks of young workers. As a consequence, ownership is down. Between World War II and 1980 the ownership rate rose without significant interruption, reaching 65.6 percent in 1980. But then it began receding again, settling at 63.8 percent in 1986. Even more disturbing, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, the rate for people under age 25 and for those in the prime homebuying ages of 25 to 43, fell more steeply. For the former, the rate dropped to 21.6 percent from 26.4 percent; for the latter, the drop was to 45.4 percent from 55 percent. These figures have become the cue for proponents of government assistance, and the Realtors are among the most insistent, as witness the statement by <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, Realtor president, that `` it is time for the federal government to recognize that homeownerhip is beneficial to everyone.'' `` Everyone'' includes lumber suppliers, plumbers, carpenters, roofers, appliance and carpet manufacturers, real estate agents, lawyers and many other folks besides the young couples seeking a home of their own. Their efforts, especially when coordinated, can mean formidable pressure for another housing program, even in the face of opposition from those, such as the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, that would like government out of private-sector matters. Out of this self-interest _ which is n't to deny an element of true public concern _ some creative, though not especially new, proposals have emerged, such as these from the Realtors: _ A program to enable first-time homebuyers to withdraw without penalty a certain amount from their Individual Retirement Accounts or other tax-deferred savings to be used only for a down payment _ Establishment of an Individual Housing Account, the money from which would mean eligibility for an income tax credit if used as a down payment _ Creation of a National Employee Homeownership Program to allow employers to provide down payment assistance to employees, with tax advantages to both But just as creative is a strictly private-sector plan that also might be considered. It is simple, informal, responsible, familial and probably beneficial not just to the individuals involved but for all society, too. Proponents of this plan observe that many homeowner parents have built up tremendous equity, in part because of the sharp rise in prices that denies their children the opportunity for a home of their own. Many of these parents are at peak earning power, simultaneous with a reduction in their expenses. Could n't they tap some of that equity in order to lend a down payment to their children? Do n't they owe it to their offspring A main feature of the plan, say its proponents, is its non-bureaucratic nature. The only way Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> gets into the act is to allow a tax deduction to the parents who borrow the money.

<HEAD>Unusual Religious Alliance Formed On Middle East Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an explosive time about a tense issue _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s dealings with <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> _ a highly unusual American religious alliance has been formed to press for solutions to the crisis. Moslem, Jewish and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> leaders are included in the new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interreligious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. What made possible the unlikely combination on the keenly divisive problem was that `` it was an idea whose time had come,'' says <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Young, executive director of the organization. It could n't have happened, he adds, `` unless the time was ripe for it.'' In any case, prominent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews and Moslems, who have been on opposing sides in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict, along with top <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> officials, are extensively involved in the common effort. About 600 religious leaders are initial backers, with other being enlisted, to work for a `` moral climate'' that would spur politicians to take initiatives regarded necessary for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> peace. Seeking to set forth a middle ground in the conflict, which has particularly divided Jews and Moslems, the committee's joint statement affirms these principles: _ Support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to secure borders, and also of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution 242 calling for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from the now violence-racked <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> taken in the 1967 war, and security of all states in the region. _ The <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people's right to self-determination and to choose their own leadership. _ The urgency of an international conference for peace involving all parties in the conflict, as well as members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> security council, including the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been reluctant about taking these positions,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It has given a higher priority to keeping the Russians out, and this has not been helpful.'' He also said that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration also has not explicitly supported the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' right to self-determination, although such a right `` has a history that started in this country.'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said discussions about a joint approach by American Christians, Jews and Moslems started last June, before the outbreak of riots in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, but events there gave the cause increased urgency. They `` dramatically demonstrate that the current situation is disastrous for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and, in the long run, will be disastrous for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as well,'' he said. He said local units of the new organization have formed in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON>, and are being planned in 11 other cities _ <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. He said the aim is to build up a national mood of Jews, Moslems and Christians that would encourage political leaders to act on the problem. `` In dealing with the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, we are dealing not just with the complexities of the particular situation, but with the whole history of prejudice against Jews and also against Arabs and Moslems,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. As a result, he said, `` they have a strong fear against trusting anyone else with the welfare of their people. There also is a great deal of insensitivity among Christians about how deep those fears are.'' The alliance maintains it is urgent that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> make <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> peace a priority of foreign policy. Among backers listed of the new effort: Moslem _ <PERSON> Dawud </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosques </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Nassar </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Iman </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deen </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Cherif </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedky </PERSON>, an American-Arab attorney of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Jewish _ Rabbi <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregations </ORGANIZATION>; its senior vice president, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorspan </PERSON>; Rabbi <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelman </PERSON>, executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Rabbinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>; Rabbi <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipman </PERSON>, present of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rabbis </ORGANIZATION>, and Rabbi <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneier </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conscience </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Christian _ Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angles </LOCATION>; the Rev. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesburgh </PERSON>, president emeritus of Notre Dame; <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops' committee on Catholic-Jewish relations; Greek Orthodox Archbishop <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON>; Episcopal Presiding Bishop <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>; the Rev. <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Post </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>; the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Humbert </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Disciples of Christ -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> Bishop <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bashore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Young, a quaker, formerly director of peace programs for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committe </ORGANIZATION>, said Jews and Moslems have differed on Mid-East issues, but `` see effort for peace as not contradicting their consistency.'' He said: `` We are committed to challenging historic and persistent prejudices against the Jewish people, Moslems and Arabs _ prejudices that inhibit the kind of cooperation for justice and peace that clearly is a moral imperative of our common Abrahamic faith.''

 Fourteen-year-old <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Salzer </PERSON> got an `` A'' on her book report without opening the book. She watched the movie instead. `` It only took me three hours to watch the movie and it would have taken me 12 hours to read the book,'' said the ninth-grader from <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Her father, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Salzer </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> and a board member of the <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Softwares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, is familiar with the situation. `` It's a problem,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` A kid essentially can rent a classic movie and do a book report from it. Kids are taking shortcuts.'' Videotape retailers across the nation say many teen-agers, children of the television generation, are taking study guides that summarize literature one step further and turning to videotapes for help with homework, renting rather than reading. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> said her teachers sometimes show movies in class, but only after students presumably have read the corresponding literature. She said she watched `` Clan of the Cave Bear'' the night before a report on the book was due. `` The teachers say the movie is different. Sometimes it is, but students do n't really care,'' she said. `` It's better to get a ` C' than an ` F.''' At parents' requests, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Marra </PERSON> pulled `` To Kill A Mockingbird'' from the shelves at his HTO Video store in suburban <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> after students were assigned to read the book Since then, <PERSON> Marra </PERSON> periodically has refused to rent certain videotapes to youths because he learned the corresponding books were homework assignments. `` We're a community-oriented shop. We try to give the community any cooperation we can,'' <PERSON> Marra </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Petraglia </PERSON> noticed young people make sporadic runs on certain films at his Video-O-Video store in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. He said a popular videotape among teens is `` Dirty Dancing,'' but when assignments dictate, he ca n't find enough copies of `` Death of a Salesman,'' `` Treasure Island,'' `` Grapes of Wrath'' and `` <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>.'' `` ` Gone With the Wind' has been picking up a little bit. I think it's book-related,'' he said. Students always have searched for the easier way, and the video scholar is just a variation of the Cliff Notes customer, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Treibitz </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> For 29 years, students have used Cliff Notes to provide summaries and analysis of books, and sales of the study guides still are growing, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Cliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. `` The problem now is with the access of video cassette recorders and with the access of video stores,'' <PERSON> Treibitz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> said Cliff Notes may produce its own videotapes, but he declined to discuss details. `` The generation that is in elementary school now, they're certainly in the video age,'' <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> said `` I would have to say the -LRB- use -RRB- of video will probably only increase.'' Teachers are increasingly using videotapes in the classroom, and as a supplement the tapes are helpful, said <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't use the video as a Cliff Note kind of crutch,'' Ms. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. `` There's a saying, ` I read the book. I do n't need to see the movie.' If you make some comparisons, maybe you need to do both.'' `` A teacher can give a lecture on the Grand Canyon, <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, space exploration,'' <PERSON> Treibitz </PERSON> said. `` A video not only gives that same material, but shows the visuals to reinforce that material. `` It ca n't replace reading, it ca n't replace writing and there are times it ca n't replace the lecture,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report: White House Creating New Group For Stock Market Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House plans to create a new group that will make final, unified <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration recommendations on how to prevent another stock market collapse, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Tuesday editions that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Brady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> task force already has made such recommendations, is creating a new interagency committee to develop a consolidated administration position in the next 60 to 90 days. The committee, which would be headed by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, would include top officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper stated, quoting unidentified White House aides. It was hoped the new committee, details of which still are being worked out, would be able to smooth over conflicts among the various regulatory agencies over how best to prevent another market crash, the newspaper stated. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Brady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> came out with its recommendations in early January, federal regulators have been engaged in often-public sniping over what regulatory changes should be made to prevent a repeat of the Oct. 19 market debacle. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, for example, has indicated he believed his agency should be chief regulator of stock index futures traded in the commodity markets, a position vehemently opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> aides suggested that the White House might view such divisiveness as weakening its influence over any legislative response to the October crash. The <ORGANIZATION> Brady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, headed by former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> senator <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, essentially recommended a coordinated, intermarket system of `` circuit breakers'' to prevent wild price swings; higher margin requirements on stock index futures; unified clearing and settlement operations in the stock and futures markets; and giving the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> superagency authority over key issues affecting the stock and futures markets. The Times said details of the interagency committee were contained in letters sent Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> to White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>. In those letters, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> referred to a conversation with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> regarding the committee. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> indicated he was pleased with the idea, but also stated that 90 days might be too long for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to wait for the new group's recommendations, given that the agencies involved already had conducted their own studies of the crash and made recommendations. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> also stated he planned to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> top submit their legislative proposals in time for a March 31 hearing on the issue.

 Stock prices were little changed today in light, lackluster trading. Analysts said the market drifted in a narrow range as both institutional and retail investors remained on the sidelines while awaiting fresh economic news due out later in the week. The government is scheduled to release January's merchandise trade figures on Thursday, just ahead of the year's first `` triple witching hour,'' when a group of options and futures on stock indexes will expire simultaneously. While concern over the two events dampened activity in the previous trading session, analysts indicated market participants may be overestimating the impact both the trade figures and the witching hour might have. Analysts noted that the market reacted quickly when trade figures were released in the previous two months. Similarly, the past couple of witching hours have been rather uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program traders.

 Textile industry analysts say the bidding may not be over for <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, even though the company has accepted a nearly $ 1 billion cash buyout offer from an investment group. A group led by <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it agreed to pay $ 61.50 in cash for each of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' 15.5 million shares outstanding, or about $ 953.24 million. The offer is subject to a majority of the shares being tendered and the necessary financing being obtained. Analysts called Odyssey's bid fair, although some said they thought the bidding could continue. In active trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' stock jumped $ 5.37 -LCB- a share to close at $ 61.12 -LCB-. Over the past few weeks, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> has fielded rival offers from <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and a group led by its own senior management, including Chairman <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a fifth generation member of the family that founded the company in 1813. The management group offered $ 55 a share in cash and securities in a leveraged buyout about two weeks ago, up from its initial offer of $ 43 a share. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed money repaid with a target company's profits or the sales of assets. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION>, a major household fabrics maker with brands that include Arrow, <ORGANIZATION> Martex </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON>, offered to buy <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> for $ 56 a share in cash, or about $ 867 million. The company confirmed Monday it had considered raising its offer to $ 62.50 a share, but had not made a formal bid at the higher price. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> refused to comment on what, if any, further action it might take. `` The arbitragers think there could be more bidding,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a textile analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redbook </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` A deal is never done until all the stock is signed over.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said a higher offer could torpedo the deal with <PERSON> Odyssey </PERSON>. `` I think they'll have to take the highest bid,'' he said Odyssey is a private investment company. Its deals have included the purchase of a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, located in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and a leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cottrell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a pollution control, engineering and construction company. <PERSON> Odyssey </PERSON> said it would finance the deal with a $ 600 million loan from <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, $ 570 million from the sale subordinated debt and preferred stock and $ 100 million in equity investment. Should the deal go through, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> predicted, Odyssey likely could sell parts of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> to pay off its debt. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> already undertook a major restructuring about five years ago, selling off some of its finished fabrics divisions to concentrate more on home furnishings. New York-based <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, one of the nation's biggest textile makers with 23,000 employees, produces home fashion textiles such as sheets, towels and carpets under the brand names <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Honda Motor Lacks Punch At Home, But Analysts See Good Potential
For Growth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Its victories in overseas markets have brought <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> worldwide recognition, but the company still is waging an uphill battle to become a dominant automaker in its own backyard. In sharp contrast with <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s success abroad _ it holds about 3.5 percent of the world auto market _ the company has had trouble penetrating the Japanese market dominated by the `` Big Two'' of <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which together control nearly a 50 percent share. In recent years, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic sales have been growing, often faster than the rate of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s overall motor-vehicle market expansion. To boost growth further, the company will add new cars and models to its product line and increase the number of <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> dealers and salesmen each year into the 1990s, says <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kume </PERSON>. By 1991, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> expects its domestic network to grow about 25 percent from now to 3,000 dealers and more than double the number of salesmen to 18,000. New products will allow <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> to sell 800,000 cars and mini-vehicles a year at home by 1991 and 1 million by the mid-1990s, <PERSON> Kume </PERSON> says. These projections compare with last year's sales of 546,979 units and this year's forecast of 620,000 vehicles <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic market share rose to 9.1 percent in 1987 from 7.0 percent in 1986. But in a market where overall demand for cars, trucks and buses, exceeded 6 million units for the first time last year, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> still lags far behind <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts say Japanese culture and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s own history have contributed to its domestic struggle. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> _ originally a motorcycle manufacturer _ had a late start in the auto business, entering the four-wheeled vehicle market in 1963 some 30 years after the Big Two. Analysts say this still haunts the company: <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s sales network of 2,400 dealers and 8,200 salespeople is dwarfed, for example, by <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s 4,000 dealers and 41,000 salespeople. <PERSON> Takamori </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, says <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` unspoken dealer loyalty'' is a major obstacle to <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s expansion in the domestic market. `` Unlike the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, where car retailers are mostly independent -LRB- from manufacturers -RRB- and often switch makers or brands they handle, there is virtually no betrayal on the part of dealers in this country,'' <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> said. Japanese automakers generally maintain high capital participation in their dealers and thus enjoy more control over them. That condition makes a switch, say, from <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, virtually impossible, <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tetsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakiya </PERSON>, author of the book `` Honda Motor: the Men, the Management, the Machines'' and professor of international relations at <ORGANIZATION> Musashino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Womens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, contends <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> could have closed the gap with the Big Two if company founder <PERSON> Shoichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Honda </PERSON> and his senior officials in the late 1960s had more foresight. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> early on had decided to rely on an air-cooled engine and missed out on the first full-fledged wave of Japanese motorization in the late 1960s and the early 1970s because it did not have the `` right product,'' a car with a quieter and cleaner water-cooled engine, <PERSON> Sakiya </PERSON> said. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> had n't chosen an air-cooled engine, its standing would've been a lot better against <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> today,'' <PERSON> Sakiya </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> introduced its 1300 model, a sedan powered by an air-cooled engine, in 1969 but replaced it two years later with a lightweight car, the <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, with a much-acclaimed water-cooled CVCC engine. A more conspicuous cause of <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s weakness at home, and in overseas markets to some extent, has been its lack of a full product line and diversity in the styling and size of its cars, according to analysts. Not until October 1985 did <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, a thriving maker of economical subcompacts, decide to pursue affluent consumers with the Legend, a 2.7 liter-engine luxury car. Because of its relatively limited lineup of models in the over 2 liter engine class, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> will not benefit as much as the Big Two from the boom in the market for bigger, more powerful and more expensive cars, analysts say. To expand its lineup further, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> also recently re-entered the minicar market and is scheduled to launch Japanese sales of a version of the Accord series assembled at its facilities in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. It is also widely rumored to be planning to introduce a sports car powered by a six-cylinder or eight-cylinder engine next year. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> also is believed to be planning a line of luxury models by the 1990s featuring a flagship sedan with a V-8 or V-12 engine. <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> says to compete domestically <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> also must deal with Japanese upbringing that fosters more conformity and harmony among individuals, compared with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system that stresses individuality. `` It's easier to sell to Americans who are n't afraid of making their own decisions and accepting the unknown, compared with Japanese consumers who are often oversensitive to impressions they make on others through the purchase of a product,'' <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> said. `` The upshot of this -LRB- Japanese -RRB- attitude is that people are driving cars, often white, from the same familiar makers.'' But analysts think <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s potential for sustained growth at home is strong. They concur that <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> is pulling ahead to emerge as the definite winner in a three-way battle for the slot of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s third biggest automaker with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

 R.H <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has raised the stakes in its battle to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, boosting its proposed payout and locking up the option to purchase two prize <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> divisions regardless of who wins control of the retailing company. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> on Monday sweetened its merger agreement with <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> by $ 200 million in cash, raising the value of the offer to $ 6.3 billion and topping a rival, hostile $ 6.2 billion proposal by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Separately, a federal judge indicated he would not rule before Wednesday in suits filed by <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> in connection with their war over <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, but effectively extended <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s buyout offer into next week. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> _ whose own offer expires April 4 _ had sought to delay expiration of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s offer by 20 days to lessen the pressure on <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> shareholders to accept the hostile bid. Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> extended its offer through Friday from today's original expiration, but stated Monday it had no immediate intention to revise its bid in response to the sweetened offer from Macy. Under terms of the amended merger agreement unanimously approved by the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> board, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> will offer $ 77.35 a share in cash for 80 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s stock, up from $ 74.50 per share in its original offer. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> plans to swap shares in the merged company and issue convertible debt securities for the remaining 20 percent of Federated shares. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock closed unchanged at $ 66 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> also granted Macy the option to purchase its <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s - <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s Wilshire and <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON> retail divisions if the merger Such `` lockup'' options frequently are used to discourage hostile suitors. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said the divisions would sell for at least $ 800 million and $ 150 million, respectively, although <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has valued those divisions at a total of about $ 1.25 billion. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> also granted <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board sole discretion over whether to maintain its `` poison pill'' anti-takeover plan. Under its previous agreement, Cincinnati-based <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> would have rescinded the plan in a merger with <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> recommended its shareholders tender their stock to <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>, calling the new offer `` substantially more favorable to <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stockholders than <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s previous offer and the coercive <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> two-tier offer.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> is offering to pay $ 75 cash a share for 70.5 million of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s common shares outstanding, or 80 percent, through Friday. The remaining 20 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock would be acquired later for $ 44 cash per share in a subsequent merger, giving the deal an aggregate value of $ 68 per share. Shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> extended its offer, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> urged its shareholders to hold onto their stock, reversing the unusual recommendation it made Sunday for stockholders to tender their shares to the hostile bidder. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> is opposed to merging with <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, but the retailer had intended to prevent its shareholders from having to accept the lower, $ 44 price under the `` back end'' of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s two-tier bid. At Monday night's hearing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> indicated he would not rule before Wednesday either on <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> request to force <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> to extend its tender offer past Friday or on <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge to <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s `` poison pill'' takeover defense Sand said he was seeking an opinion from the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s latest tender offer, which was revised from a previous lower bid, constituted a brand-new offer. If the judge sides with <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> would have to delay its offer _ and the date when it could acquire tendered shares _ to give shareholders time to consider the new bid. The judge said he would not get the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> opinion before Wednesday and would not rule on either issue before then. However, Sand stated both buyout offers would have to remain in effect for at least three business days after he ruled on the poison pill issue, effectively extending <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s offer through next week.

 Buoyed by prospects of a billion-dollar court settlement in a 12-year-old patent infringement case and by takeover speculation, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock has soared on Wall Street in recent weeks. The instant photography pioneer is seeking $ 5.7 billion in damages from <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was found guilty in 1985 of violating seven of 150 Polaroid patents when it entered the instant camera business in 1976. After reviewing papers filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here last month, analysts increased their estimates for a possible settlement to above $ 1 billion from their initial $ 300 million to $ 500 million range. `` After reading the documents, a number of people said that <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s case is stronger than we had expected,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The companies are to meet Friday with Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> and may discuss setting a trial date on the damages issue. Analysts said the possibility of a large award has attracted investors and also invited speculation that a corporate raider might bid for the company in hopes of realizing a windfall on a big settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, was trading in the low $ 20s a share until the damage request was disclosed Feb. 19. Since then <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> has climbed, topping $ 36 a share at one point. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> rose 25 cents to $ 34 a share Monday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. Purchasing patterns have been in small blocks, however, and no individual buyer has notified the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that it holds as much as 5 percent of the stock. Polaroid wo n't comment on stock activity, takeover rumors or a settlement. `` We have indicated from the very beginning 12 years ago that we were always open to an out-of-court settlement,'' spokesman <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` Talking about such matters in the media has a chilling effect on that possibility.'' In court documents, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> argues it is entitled to $ 3.2 billion in lost camera and film sales. The company is seeking $ 2.5 billion more for lost opportunities to develop and market new products. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, which was ordered out if its $ 200 million a year instant camera business in January 1986, has dismissed the claim as `` ludicrous and ridiculously inflated.'' The <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based photo giant argues <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> is entitled to a reasonable royalty, not lost profits. If <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> finds <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> guilty of willfully infringing on <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s patents, pre-tax damages can be tripled under federal law, raising the potential maximum award to $ 11 billion. No one expects the settlement to be that large, but a $ 1 billion award _ equal to about $ 10 a share _ would allow <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> to diversify into fields such as information retrieval or conventional photography. Along with the Polaroid brand name, the possibility that the company could run better under new management is keeping takeover interest high, analysts said. `` It has the characteristics of the type of company that could be run to generate greater cash flow,'' <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Land </PERSON> invented instant photography in 1947 and first marketed it in 1948. Polaroid held a monopoly for almost 30 years until <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> entered the field. Polaroid camera sales peaked at 7.5 million units in 1978 before sinking to 3.4 million in 1984. Sales jumped to 4.4 million in 1986 after the company introduced the Spectra camera, with quality closer to that of 35 millimeter prints, but fell by 16 percent last year. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> had entered the 1970s with high expectations due to technology for its SX-70 camera, which produced fast, dry color prints. But Polaroid never was able to bring the cost of film down enough, which hurt instant photography sales. Analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> could get a boost next month with the introduction of the Spectra 600, priced at $ 40 to $ 60, and the Image, which promises better quality for $ 60 to $ 80.

<TEXT>
 The dollar gained against most major currencies in early European trading today. Gold prices were mixed. Dealers said the dollar was trading quietly in a narrow range as market participants awaited Thursday's report of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit for January. The British pound, which soared 10 cents against the dollar in a month, slipped back ahead of the presentation to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> this afternoon of the Conservative government's annual spring budget. Dealers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> said they were waiting to see whether the budget delivered expected tax cuts and led to lower interest rates. An interest rate cut would rein in the pound. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before it begins in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.02 yen to a closing 127.25. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 127.10 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.6660 West German marks, up from 1.6645; 1.3760 Swiss francs, up from 1.3693; 5.6585 French francs, up from 5.6375; 1.8717 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8645; 1,232.70 Italian lire, up from 1,227.87; 1.2570 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2577 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.8510, compared with $ 1.8575 Monday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 440.80 a troy ounce, compared with late Monday's $ 441.00. At mid-morning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 442.15. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 442.25, up from $ 441.50 late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.54 to close at a bid $ 443.27.

 Stock prices rebounded today, while the dollar remained nearly unchanged against the Japanese yen as traders in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> awaited figures on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for January. The dollar dipped at one point to 126.80 yen, but closed at 127.25 yen, up 0.02 yen from Monday's close. Its high for the day was 127.30 yen. On the previous two trading days, the dollar lost a total of 0.97 yen.

Volume was estimated at 1.7 billion shares in the first section. `` Trading was active, but there were n't any real factors worth commenting on,'' said an analyst with a major brokerage. `` The market is gradually progressing toward its precrash levels and we are seeing a general consolidation,'' said the analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Traders said steels and heavy industrials led the afternoon surge.

 Stock prices moved higher Tuesday morning on optimism about Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s budget statement for fiscal 1989, due later in the day. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 19.2 points, or 1 percent, at 1,838.7 at midday. Volume was a moderate 241.3 million shares at midday, up from 176.3 million shares at the same time a day earlier. Prices advanced gradually through the morning because of optimism about the contents of <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s budget statement, dealers said. In addition to tax rate cuts, investors were expecting <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> to outline financial targets which might provide a further boost for the pound, dealers said. That might force the government to cut British base lending rates in order to stabilize the currency, they added. But some analysts discounted the idea because of concern that an interest rate cut would boost inflation. `` The idea of a base rate cut seems to be gaining credibility in the market,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we still do n't think it's very likely.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says the <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s unsolicited $ 1.8 billion takeover offer will likely force it to abandon a previous agreement to sell most of its tire operations to <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> said its board of directors has authorized management to explore alternatives to the <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> bid that possibly could include a new deal with <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> said Monday that its board met to consider <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 58-a-share tender offer but took no action The company said that in light of <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>'s offer it was unlikely to consummate the joint venture agreement it announced with the Japanese tiremaker on Feb. 16. Under that agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> would pay about $ 1.25 billion to buy 75 percent of Firestone's tire operations. <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>'s offer is contingent on Firestone dropping its plans to enter the joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> said that in seeking alternatives to the <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> offer, its advisers had begun discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>. The board indicated it would meet again this week to complete its review of <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. The board also reiterated its stance that shareholders should not tender their shares until it issued its recommendation. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> had stated previously the board would make its recommendation by Friday. Firestone stock dipped 87 -LCB- cents to $ 61.62 -LCB- a share in active trading Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, a federal court in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> heard arguments over <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>'s lawsuit attempting to declare <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover law unconstitutional. <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> is seeking a temporary restraining order to keep the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Control Share Acquisition Act from affecting its bid for Firestone. The act requires a hostile bidder to wait up to 50 days for shareholders to vote before he can acquire tendered shares. A lawsuit challenging the law was filed last week by <ORGANIZATION> Veere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a holding company owned by <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> that is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, an attorney for Veere, said the law is a burden on interstate commerce and could hurt shareholders by giving <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> time to defeat <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer, launched a week ago.

 The deficit in the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign trade surged 13.7 percent last year to a record $ 160.7 billion, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the current account deficit grew from the previous record of $ 141.4 billion in 1986 even though the deficit for the final three months of the year narrowed slightly. The current account covers not only the flow of merchandise across the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border but also the flow of services, primarily investment earnings between countries. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has run deficits in merchandise trade for 16 of the past 17 years, the current account was in surplus as recently as 1981 as Americans' earnings on overseas investments were enough to offset the merchandise deficits. On Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported a 0.4 percent rise in January business inventories, less than half the December increase, reflecting a rebound in car sales that reduced backlogs of unsold vehicles. Analysts said the slower growth suggested the economy may not weaken or lapse into recession in the first half of this year, as had been widely feared following the stock market crash in October. Higher business inventories and sluggish consumer spending are considered a negative trend because they eventually collide to cause production cutbacks and layoffs. The news was ignored by <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where stocks showed no clear trend in the quietest trading this year. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 15.09 points to 2,050.07, in a session influenced largely by takeover news and speculation. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> totaled 131.89 million shares, the lightest since a 111.58 million-share day on Dec. 29. Prices barely budged in the bond market, a sensitive barometer of interest rates and the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond declined -LRB- point, or about $ 1.25 for every $ 1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, edged up to 8.51 percent from 8.50 percent late Friday. Traders were reluctant to buy or sell aggressively, largely because of uncertainty about the January trade deficit numbers to be released by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. The markets have been fixated on the trade deficit for months because the economy's unprecedented reliance on imports is considered one of the most visible symbols of economic weakness and declining competitiveness. But the deficit narrowed in November and December, suggesting the protracted decline of the dollar over the past two years was helping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers reclaim foreign and domestic markets from overseas competition.

<HEAD>Toymaker's Losses Lead to Restructuring Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to miss an April 1 interest payment on its debentures, says that unless it can restructure its finances it may have to seek bankruptcy court protection. The toymaker announced Monday it lost $ 98.8 million in the final quarter of 1987 and $ 105.4 million for the whole year. And Chairman <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> has a $ 19 million interest payment due on debentures April 1, but will not make that payment. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> and other major toy manufacturers were hit hard by declining sales last year. The losses announced by <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> Monday follow deficits of $ 110.6 in fourth-quarter 1986 and $ 111.2 million for all of that year. The toymaker reported sales of $ 69 million in the last quarter of 1987, compared with $ 73.7 million for the same period a year earlier. Its 1987 sales totaled $ 504.5 million, up slightly from $ 500.7 million in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> said it planned to announce a restructuring plan by the end of this week. However, if all parties to the restructuring do not agree to the plan, `` the company could find itself in reorganization,'' said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for corporate development. The company's short-term bank debt increased from $ 90.7 million in 1986 to $ 142.1 million in 1987. Overall, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 59.6 million in interest during 1987, compared with $ 42.7 million in 1986. Nearly $ 40 million of the 1987 interest was due to the $ 300 million in subordinated debentures <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> has outstanding. <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said the company will propose to replace those debentures with a combination of common stock, new debentures and debentures convertible into stock. If the owners of the debentures accept the proposed exchange, it would reduce some of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s interest expenses and convert some debt into positive ownership interest in the company. `` The company needs to get out from underneath its significant debt load to obtain profitibility. The company needs to take steps to ensure its survival,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> has laid off more than 300 workers and taken other steps to cut costs.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is recalling about 28,000 1987 and 1988 Ford Crown <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> and Mercury Grand Marquis station wagons for inspection of seat belts that may have improperly installed retractors. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also is recalling 9,300 1988-model <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> cars for installation of spring seats on the rear torsion springs. Seat belts in the station wagons' optional rear-facing auxiliary seats will be inspected and replaced, if necessary, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release Monday. The belts might fit too loosely or retract slowly if retractors were found to be installed on the wrong side of the seats, the statement said. The spring seats on the Continentals are meant to prevent the spring from touching the rear tire if the spring breaks while in service, it said. Of the 9,300 Continentals being recalled, about 5,000 will be inspected to see whether inboard attachments of the driver's and right front seat belt assemblies were properly secured, the statement said. Belts not properly secured to the anchor attachment could loosen or pull free in a collision, it said. Inspections and necessary modifications will be made by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln-Mercury </ORGANIZATION> dealers at no cost to owners, the statement said. There were no reports of accidents or injuries involving any of the components involved with the recalls, the company said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> today postponed a decision on whether to approve a $ 110 million merger that would make the regional <ORGANIZATION> Missouri-Kansas-Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> a part of the giant <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gradison </PERSON> canceled a scheduled vote, saying that Commissioner <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had failed to give his fellow commission members adequate time to review his proposed conditions for the merger Under agency rules, commissioners must distribute any amendments the day before a planned vote. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> did not outline his proposals at today's brief session and, under commission rules, amendments are not made public until they are discussed at a meeting. No new meeting to consider the merger was scheduled immediately, and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said it was unlikely that another vote will be set before next week. The railroads contend that consolidating operations would provide improved service at lower costs and ensure reliable long-term transportation, especially for Midwestern grain shippers relying on the 3,100-mile MKT system known as the `` Katy.'' Other railroads have questioned whether the proposed merger will reduce competition, because the <PERSON> Katy </PERSON>'s lines generally parallel some <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> routes from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the Gulf Coast. The Union Pacific is a 21,500-mile network formed by a rail merger six years ago. To address those concerns, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> has offered competing railroads the rights to use some trackage on proposed merger routes. Without the merger, the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> has been told, the financially ailing <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> could face problems surviving against bigger competitors. Operating income for the <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> declined from $ 37 million in 1981 to $ 5 million in 1986. The Union Pacific, the nation's third largest railroad system in terms of track mileage, serves about 20 states with routes from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in the West to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The company was formed in 1982 with the merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> railroads. The Katy serves six states, with mostly north-south routes running from <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A separate east-west route extends between <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, which filed an application in November 1986 seeking government approval of the <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> acquisition, says the merger would produce operating savings of $ 61 million a year. Company officials say grain shippers would benefit through a shorter, more direct single-line route to export markets in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> ports. However, the merger would eliminate about 1,100 <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> jobs because of closings of rail yards and repair shops. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> also plans to abandon 405 miles of track, mostly operated by <PERSON> Katy </PERSON>, if the merger is approved. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> has taken steps to ease objections to the merger. For example, the company has agreed to pay $ 1 million to the southeast <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Parson </LOCATION> in exchange for not opposing the merger. The city would lose about 300 <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> jobs, with an estimated $ 8 million payroll, under the merger.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an entertainment conglomerate with cable television systems and the nation's No. 1 theater chain, has announced the creation of New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Corsair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. The subsidiary firm will develop films that cost between $ 3 million and $ 10 million, an amount considered modest by <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> standards. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>, announced Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Corsair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION>'s first production would be `` The Miss Firecracker Contest,'' a comedy written by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>. Actress <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, who was nominated for an Oscar for her role as a newscast producer in `` Broadcast News,'' has been signed to star in the film. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said the venture was a `` low-key experiment.'' `` We think there is a window for modestly priced, high-demographic films,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. `` We're looking for class. Not art films, but not slash and gash movies either. We're not into teen exploitation films.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, who was nominated for an Oscar as best director for the movie `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'' has been named to head Corsair. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> had directed for Pyramid Films, also a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>. Corsair replaces Pyramid Films. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> expects to produce three or four films a year, he said. `` Frank -LRB- <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> -RRB- has done 17 movies and he's only been over budget once, and that was only be two percent,'' he said. Most of the firm's movies will be for theater distribution, followed by sale to pay television or the video market. Finally they will be sold to cable, he said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> owns 2,000 movie screens, making it the largest chain in the country. `` Certainly having that number of screens gives you a leg up,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. `` But a movie has to be released across the board to the most screens for it to generally make sense.''

 The stock market was unchanged in the early going today as reluctance by traders to take positions ahead of the government's upcoming release of trade data continued to dampen activity. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was unchanged at 2,050.07 at 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 673 up, 568 down and 525 unchanged in the first 90 minutes of trading. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 46,070,000 million shares. Analysts said the market fluctuated in a narrow range in the absence of any major news. `` There is a mood in the street of reluctance to make commitments'' prior to the release of January merchandise trade figures on Thursday, said <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. That sentiment that also dominated activity in the previous session `` The last two -LRB- market -RRB- responses to the trade numbers took place in a half hour'' of trading, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. While analysts noted that the market may be overplaying the impact the figure is likely to have on Wall Street, this week's trade report will come just ahead of a quarterly `` triple witching hour'' involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes The past couple of witching hours have been relatively uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program traders.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in a very narrow range this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Traders said there was no fresh news overnight to influence the market and little follow-through from Monday's strong performance. Prices were higher across the board on Monday mainly because of a private forcast that farmers will be planting fewer acres of soybeans this season than had previously been thought. The estimate pegged soybean acreage at 57.5 million acres, only slightly higher than the 57.4 million acres planted last year. On the opening, wheat was unchanged to -LCB- cent lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.07 a bushel; corn was unchanged to \ cent higher with March at $ 1.98 -LCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 1.90 \ a bushel; and soybeans were -LCB- cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with March at $ 6.14 \ a Livestock and meat futures were mostly weaker on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 Imagine spraying ketchup on a hamburger or spritzing mustard on a hotdog with an aerosol-like can. A Hoboken-based company wants just such containers to become commonplace in kitchens across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Enviro-Spray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> also hopes its packaging technology, already popular in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, will help transform the 8-year-old research and development company into a profitable manufacturing and marketing firm. The company, which went public last year, hopes to have lines of sprayable ketchup, tomato sauces and mustard in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stores by June. Mayonnaise, chocolate and apple sauce are waiting in the wings, said company President <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>. `` It's the beginning of something very, very important,'' he said in a recent interview. The patented spray process was introduced successfully in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where it is used to dispense a popular form of shave gel as well as condiments, hand cleaners and pharmaceuticals. For its push into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Enviro-Spray will focus on food products, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, assistant to the president. And for the first time, the company will get involved in selling the products as well as the process. The ketchup, mustard and tomato sauce to be marketed here is made by the French concern CCRF under the <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Vetillard </PERSON> label, Ms. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. Essentially, the cans resemble aerosol sprayers but do not mix other substances with the product to be dispensed. Inside the can is a pouch with sodium bicarbonate and citric acid, which is activated by a button on the can. When the can is activated, the two chemicals react inside the pouch, creating pressure that forces the product out. And presto, a thin stripe of ketchup is applied to your waiting hot dog. The `` GrowPak'' pouches are tamper proof and the food needs no refrigeration, has a longer shelf life and is more convenient to dispense, <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> said. Since no propellants are needed to make the cans work, no fluorocarbons, identified as harmful to the protective ozone layer in the atmosphere, are introduced into the environment. Banks said he hopes such advantages will convince consumers and restaurants to buy GrowPak products and help make the company profitable. Enviro-Spray had a net loss of $ 448,000 on sales of $ 455,000 in the second quarter ended Dec. 31. That compared with a $ 1 million loss on sales of $ 191,000 in the same period a year earlier. Ms. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> attributed the losses to the heavy start-up costs associated with the development of the equipment that manufactures the pouches. Banks sees the company entering the black by 1989. `` When people get their hands on these cans, they really love -LRB- them, -RRB-'' he said. Whether they will be willing to spend two to three times more for them _ $ 2.50 to $ 3 for a 9-ounce can, as Banks described their cost _ is another question. `` I doubt people would be willing to pay that price,'' said <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, Pa.-based H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ketchup producer. Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said she had never heard of the process. `` It just seems like a strange idea,'' she said, adding that consumers may have a difficult time accepting a food product in a type of container that usually dispenses hairspray, carpet cleaner or disinfectant. About 30 percent to 40 percent of the ketchup market is contained in plastic squirt bottles, a development of only the last decade, she said. Enviro-Spray also sells its system to drug, cosmetic, pet and plant care companies, <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> said. Last year, 10 million pouches with the system were sold in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and 15 million are expected to be sold this year. Banks hopes to sell 10 million in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988. Company officials believe their business will grow as the products in the cans catch on. `` The more cans of <PERSON> Vetillard </PERSON>'s ketchup we sell, the more pouches we sell to them,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Black </PERSON>.

 Angora goats partial to the thorny brush and arid <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> terrain are clothing the world's fashionable and cornering the nation's mohair industry for ranchers of the <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plateau </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' 3,000 mohair producers generate more than $ 150 million in annual mohair and goat sales _ a figure dwarfed by cotton or wool standards but enough to give a boost to an economy battered by the oil slump. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> mohair accounts for 96 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production and ranks second worldwide behind <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The ranchers of <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plateau </ORGANIZATION>, a ranching region covering 23 million acres, have withstood 50 years of swings in fashion to establish a firm foothold in the world market. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. May, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Mohair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, says <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ranchers export 98 percent of their crop and take pride in their small contribution toward improving the nation's balance of trade. Based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angelo </LOCATION>, the council has a $ 500,000 annual budget, four staff members and a hefty mission promoting a tiny industry around the world, May said, `` but we get after it.'' `` It's the best-kept secret for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' May said. `` It's kind of ironic these rural ranchers are producing something shown at fashion shows in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' The economic contributions of the mohair industry have gained prominence now that falling oil prices have cut into the royalties <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ranchers can earn from drilling and exploration on their land. Texans will shear 17 million to 18 million pounds this year from their Angora goat herds, making their crop worth about $ 50 million, and the sale of the animals pumps another $ 100 million into the state economy, May said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, meanwhile, produced 28.3 million pounds in 1987, compared with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of 15.5 million pounds. That compares with a nationwide 1987 cotton crop worth an estimated $ 4.5 billion, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' share was worth about $ 1.5 billion, said council spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> Mohair comes exclusively from <LOCATION> Angora </LOCATION> goats _ not to be mistaken with the Angora fiber that comes from rabbits _ and the animals thrive in a 15-county region in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as equidistant from the equator as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, May said. `` Both -LRB- areas -RRB- are arid, and have the same brushy type of ranch land,'' he said. `` They need browse or brush, they do n't do very well in tall grass. Here we have a lot of cactus and rocks and mesquite trees and live-oak trees.'' Being a speciality fabric, mohair is especially vulnerable to the fancy of fashion designers. Prices have swung in recent years from a low of 30 cents a pound in 1971 to a high of $ 5.10 in 1979. The current price is about $ 2.40, May said. When mohair slips below $ 2 a pound, ranchers are eligible for federal farm subsidies, May said. The funds come from a tariff on imported wool and mohair and not taxpayers. `` It's a very fluctuating market because it's a luxury fiber,'' May said. `` It's been paying off really well since 1976 ... but now it's starting to slow down.'' Mohair weaves into a brushy-type fabric, while the look now is smooth and sleek, May said. But the <ORGANIZATION> Mohair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be daunted by the whims of fashion, and May says it plans promotions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> buy about 25 percent of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> mohair and use it in men's suits. `` We're going to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this spring and <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> next fall to develop a new market,'' May said. The council will also spend more than a tenth of its budget _ $ 55,000 _ for a 30-minute fashion show at <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Apparel Market this weekend. The Mohair Council announced in early February it had appointed its first national spokeswoman, former Miss USA <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The 1977 pageant winner and her husband, <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON>, raise Angora goats in <LOCATION> Boerne </LOCATION>. In addition to promoting ranching, Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> wants to make sure the state gets its share of the mohair processing business. A financial marketing analyst for the commissioner, <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Piccirillo </PERSON>, said millions of dollars are being lost because raw mohair leaves the state to be spun and woven elsewhere. The two wool and mohair cleaning plants in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> can handle about 2 million pounds a year _ a fraction of total production, <PERSON> Piccirillo </PERSON> said. The department is working with a group in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> interested in setting up a third cleaning plant, he said, and is coordinating a study with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on the potential of processing mohair and turning it into a finished product.

<HEAD>Oslo's Price Explosion A Sign of Wider Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 High prices have always made it tough for visitors to <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, but now even well-paid Norwegians are finding it hard to cope. Fashion clothing shops, often used as barometers of consumer spending, rarely see customers, and newspapers are carrying going-out-of-business ads from well-known furriers. Only a few years ago, they shared the bonanza of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s oil boom. <PERSON> Kaupang </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Bokhandel </PERSON>, a leading <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> bookstore for more than 60 years, closed its doors after Christmas, one of several family-owned shops that apparently succumbed to sharply rising rents. The price explosion in this seaside capital is a sign of nationwide problems. Until recently, Norwegians were cushioned by high wage increases and easy credit. They emptied their savings accounts, which were taxed, took tax-deductible loans and spent freely, while the government used its <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil revenues to cover the public's debt from overspending Norwegians also benefit from a welfare state, which provides free hospitalization and other social services, making savings less important. Education also is free, but high school books can cost 200 kroner _ about $ 31 _ each. They barely noticed that their capital had become one of the most expensive cities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which is how it ranked in a survey of 103 countries by Business International published in December. Taking <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as a standard of 100, <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> was rated 139, the highest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and eighth in the world. `` We have been living like some big oil country in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Egil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakke </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. But now the spending spree is over. The government has declared war on an inflation rate that reached 8.7 percent last year, more than twice the European average. Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON>'s Labor government introduced a stiff wage regulation bill this month limiting pay hikes over the next year to one krone per hour, or about 15 cents. The bill was the most severe economic package since a 15-month-long wage-price freeze was imposed 10 years ago. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> heads a minority Labor government against an array of non-socialist opposition parties that criticize her interventionist policies and blame her for creating the problem by letting government spending get out of hand. But everyone agrees urgent action is required, and the bill is likely to sail through with little opposition. `` There is a need for a breathing space to steady the situation,'' former Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Kaare </PERSON> <PERSON> Willoch </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s problems would make most other countries envious. The country has virtually no unemployment, and despite falling oil income, it is expected to have a budget surplus of 9.3 billion kroner _ $ 1.45 billion _ this year. But wealth brought complacency. Wages and prices rose swiftly for two years, until <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> found it had priced itself out of some European markets. In 1987, a year when the normal work week was reduced from 40 to 37 1 @ 2 hours, wage costs per unit produced rose by more than 13 percent in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, compared with a 5 percent average in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s trading partners, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> Poor management became endemic. The state-owned oil company, <ORGANIZATION> Statoil </ORGANIZATION>, is now overrunning its budget for a new refinery by 100 percent. The scandal caused the resignation of company president <PERSON> Arve </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnsen </PERSON>, who built <ORGANIZATION> Statoil </ORGANIZATION> into a world leader. Even more embarrassing, the cost overruns were almost as high for the new headquarters of the central bank, <ORGANIZATION> Norges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. A major step toward recovery came on Feb. 26, when the main trade union federation reached an agreement with employers for a 5 percent ceiling on wage increases. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> moved swiftly to declare a freeze on further negotiations, imposing the wage package on the rest of the economy, until a wage regulation bill could be legislated. The measures are coming late for <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, a city of 450,000 that curls around the tip of a clear-watered, 60-mile-long fjord. Traveling businessmen know it as a pleasant place to stop _ as long as the company is paying. A double room at a major international hotel costs 1,505 kroner, or $ 237, and a beer at the bar costs 35 kroner, or $ 5.50. A short cab ride can run about $ 11. Norwegians themselves find living costs outstrip their salaries. A double-meat hamburger at a fast-food restaurant costs more than $ 4, and a pair of jeans is close to $ 80. A kilogram of pure ground beef at the supermarket costs the equivalent of $ 10.65 per pound. `` I always have to shop around and look for the daily specials,'' said housewife <PERSON> Randi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoel </PERSON>, who says she patronizes as many as 10 different food stores in a week to look for bargains. Like other Scandinavian countries, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> has put a high tax on alcohol to discourage drinking. Sales for home use are made only through the state-owned liquor monopoly, where a liter of average quality scotch whisky is a whopping 290 kroner, or $

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has withdrawn a key objection to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s emergency evacuation plans for the $ 5.3 billion <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> opponents, citing the removal of a key critic of the plans from a <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> review board, charged that the agency caved in to pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the plant's owners A <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> spokesman today called that charge `` a smokescreen.'' A <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman would not comment. The agency said in testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that shelters are not needed and evacuation alone offers enough protection for people that crowd beaches near the seacoast reactor on hot summer days. Last summer, the agency would not approve the plans, citing 55 deficiencies observed in a February 1986 drill. A major objection was that there are n't enough airtight buildings to protect people from dangerous radiation that could be released in an accident. Now the state has considered sheltering and determined that `` in most cases evacuation would be a preferred option and would provide ample time to move the beach population from the area safely, before there would be any radioactive release,'' <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanzoni </PERSON> said today. <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>'s new testimony concludes: `` The requirement for a range of protective measures has been satisfied, even though the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> has chosen not to shelter the summer beach population except in very limited circumstances. With respect to the summer beach population, -LRB- federal standards -RRB- have been met.'' <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> officials acknowledged in their testimony that they were deferring to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff's argument that evacuation offers better protection than sheltering. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff and other four other federal agencies out of eight involved in an interagency review of the plan had been trying to persuade <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> to change its position, according to testimony during hearings on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> plans. The other four were the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> is completed but unlicensed until it can gain <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> approval for evacuation plans for a 10-mile zone around it. An <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> licensing board resumes hearings next month on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> plans. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> officials wo n't cooperate in planning for six <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities within the 10-mile zone. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> has submitted its own plans for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. No hearings have been set. The new <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> testimony stopped short of endorsing the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> plans, but it clears a major obstacle. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Backus </PERSON>, lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Seacoast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I view it as a total agency collapse.'' He noted that <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a top <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> official in its Northeast regional office who had written the earlier criticism of <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s plans, was not involved in the new testimony. `` I suspect that there was a fight for the soul of the agency here and the guys who are no longer the witnesses are not the guys who won the fight,'' <PERSON> Backus </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> has capitulated to those who want <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> licensed regardless of the fact that minimum safety requirements can not be met,'' said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> today declined to comment on the new testimony and on charges that the agency succombed to pressure to change its opinion. <PERSON> Scanzoni </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials pressured <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Says Rising Foreign Investment in US `Is a Plus'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today that foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is a plus,'' even at current record levels. `` It is a highly desirable international trend,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said he was less worried about the fact that more and more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets are being aquired by Japanese and other foreign investors than he would be if they were simply amassing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars. Despite the recent increase in foreign holdings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` we still have a $ 50 billion greater balance in investment abroad,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chief also said that chances were `` relatively good'' for maintaining the current economic recovery, now in its sixth year and a record for peacetime expansions, `` through another year.'' But, he added, `` although the near-term prospects thus look reasonably encouraging, major uncertainties remain and we should not be complacent about the nation's economic future.'' `` To a considerable extent, we are still sailing in uncharterted waters,'' he said. He reiterated earlier testimony that reducing the government's $ 150 billion annual budget deficit should be government's No. 1 priority. He hailed recent data showing that unemployment in February had dipped to 5.7 percent, its lowest level since May 1979. He said that, while theoretically there was a point at which lower unemployment rates could trigger a new burst of wage-driven inflation, `` I do n't think we're there yet.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was asked by Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, whether he was troubled by the extent of the growing foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is buying <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and leasing it back to us,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> responded, `` I am very little concerned about the issue of foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On the contrary, integration of world economies is a desirable trend.'' `` We will find that foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be a plus,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. He said that companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that have been bought by foreign concerns have become `` good corporate citizens.'' He said it was difficult to tell the exact extent of foreign holdings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In terms of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities alone, foreign investors held 16.4 percent of the total at the end of last year, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. In other testimony, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> called upon newly industrialized countries in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and particularly <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, to do more to bring their economic and monetary polices into equilibrium with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other major trading partners. He also praised the recent stance by the government of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for not favoring intervention by the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in support of the pound against the German mark and other key currencies.

 The stock market moved modestly lower today as investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the government's upcoming release of trade data and the year's first `` triple witching hour. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 4.15 points to 2,045.92 at noon on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 10 to 9 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 695 up, 619 down and 526 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 66,680,000 million shares. Analysts said the market drifted in a narrow range in the absence of any major news. `` There is a mood in the street of reluctance to make commitments'' prior to the government's release of January merchandise trade figures on Thursday, said <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

While analysts noted that the market may be overplaying the impact the figure is likely to have on Wall Street, this week's trade report will come just ahead of a quarterly triple witching hour involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes The past couple of witching hours have been relatively uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program traders.

 The deficit in the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign trade surged to a record $ 160.7 billion in 1987 with the additional red ink pushing the country further into the hole as the world's largest debtor nation, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the current account deficit last year was 13.7 percent higher than the previous record of $ 141.4 billion set in 1986 despite the fact that the deficit for the final three months of the year narrowed slightly. The current account covers not only the flow of merchandise across the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border but also the flow of services, primarily investment earnings, between countries. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has run deficits in merchandise trade for 16 of the past 17 years, the current account was in surplus as recently as 1981 as Americans' earnings on overseas investments were enough to offset the merchandise deficits. But since that time Americans have handed over billions of dollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods. With all of that wealth now in foreign hands, the perennial advantage the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has had in investments has shifted and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has become the world's largest debtor country. Being a net debtor means that foreigners now own more in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments than Americans hold in foreign investments. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was last a net debtor in 1914. It regained that status in 1985 with a foreign debt of $ 111.9 billion. That debt grew to $ 263.6 billion at the end of 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today that foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is a highly desirable international trend.'' He said he was less worried about the fact that that more and more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets are being acquired by Japanese and other foreign investors than he would be if they were simply amassing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars. Economists said with today's new figures the total debt has probably surpassed $ 400 billion, although the government's official accounting will not be made until June. Today's report showed that the bulk of the 1987 trade deficit came from a $ 159.2 billion imbalance in merchandise trade, a figure which was first reported last month. Adding to that deficit were payments of $ 13.5 billion in foreign aid and other government transfer payments such as Social Security paid to retirees living overseas. That figure was reduced slightly by a surplus of $ 12 billion in the services category. While foreigners now own more in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments, the payments still showed a slight positive because many of the older <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments are earning a higher rate of return. However, the services surplus was down from $ 18.6 billion in 1986 and has been dwindling steadily. Economists expect the services surplus to be wiped out altogether in future years as more and more American dollars are paid to foreigners to meet interest payments on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt. For the fourth quarter, the current account deficit shrank slightly to $ 39 billion, down from $ 43.4 billion in the third quarter. This improvement reflected a slightly smaller merchandise trade deficit and a resumption of surpluses in the services category. In the third quarter, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had run a deficit with the rest of the world in investment earnings for the first time in 29 years. Democratic presidential candidates have been attacking the administration, charging that the country's new status as the world's biggest debtor is directly attributable to the failure of the administration to come to grips with huge federal budget deficits. The Democrats argue that the federal government's need to borrow billions of dollars each year to cover the shortfall between revenues and spending attracted large sums of foreign investment to this country. While the administration agrees that deficit reduction is needed to reduce the country's dependence on foreign investment, administration officials contend that the change in the country's investment position has been over-dramatized The annual Economic Report of the President said the transformation of the country to debtor status was `` no cause for alarm'' because the amount in interest payments to foreigners needed to service that debt is tiny in terms of the overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. The report estimated interest payments to foreigners would total less than one-half of 1 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product. But many private economists warn that the country's debtor status is a threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and will ultimately result in a lower standard of living as more and more money is transferred into foreign hands. `` The most profound and enduring legacy of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> period is its conversion of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from the largest creditor country in the world to the largest debtor,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>. `` The trade deficit and its financial consequences hang like a sword of Damocles over the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. economy.'' <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON> argues that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> need to attract large sums of foreign investment to meet its debt obligations makes American economic and foreign policy `` exceedingly vulnerable to decisions made abroad for the indefinite future.'' He estimated that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt to the rest of the world would likely approach $ 1 trillion before beginning to level off at the end of 1995. This rise in debt assumes modest improvements in the current account balance.

<HEAD>General Mills Reports Sharp Third-Quarter Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings jumped 25.5 percent in the third quarter of its fiscal year, prompted largely by growth in its consumers foods division. Earnings in the 3 months ended Feb. 28 totaled $ 71.4 million, or 83 cents per share, compared with $ 56.9 million, or 64 cents per share a year ago. Revenues increased 10 percent, to $ 1.44 billion from $ 1.31 billion in the same period last year, the company said in a statement. For the first three quarters, earnings totaled $ 228.2 million, or $ 2.60 per share, on sales of $ 4.33 billion, compared with $ 185.9 million, or $ 2.09 per share, on $ 3.84 billion in the 1986 period. Both periods benefited from an accounting change that resulted in a $ 5.8 million gain in the third quarter and a $ 17.3 million gain for the nine-month period, the company said. Chairman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said good volume growth in consumer foods, strong performance by key restaurant concepts and significant productivity gains led to a 15 percent cumulative gain in operating profits. Year-to-date results also benefited from the effective tax rate declining to 40.3 percent from 48.4 percent last year, primarily reflecting the effect of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Consumer Foods achieved a 2 percent increase in domestic package food volume in the third quarter, leading to sales and operating profit gains of 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. Restaurant results in the third quarter showed gains in sales and operating profits of 14 percent and 11 percent, respectively. `` These results reflect strong performance by Red Lobster seafood restaurants, where efforts to increase lunch business helped boost customer traffic over 5 percent above last year's comparable quarter and the successful expansion of The Olive Garden Italian restaurants,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said

 Nearly 150 complaints of sudden acceleration have prompted the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to open an investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legend </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rover </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON>. The agency said Monday the investigation covers 62,500 1986-1988 Acura Legends and <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rover </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterlings </PERSON> with automatic shifts. The Austin Rover Sterling uses the same mechanical components as the Legend. The new investigation brings to seven the number of sudden acceleration probes being conducted by <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>. Five of the investigations involve imported vehicles. American <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, through spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butorac </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Gardena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, declined to comment specifically on the <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> investigation, saying it would be inappropriate `` because we simply have n't heard anything yet.'' `` We've checked every vehicle in which that incident -LRB- sudden acceleration -RRB- was reported, -LRB- and -RRB- never found any mechanical or electrical defect that could have caused it,'' <PERSON> Butorac </PERSON> said. He declined to say what could have brought on the sudden acceleration incidents in the absence of a mechanical or electrical cause. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> has received 147 complaints of sudden acceleration in the cars, resulting in 82 accidents, 11 injuries and no fatalities. The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based public-issues group, had petitioned <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> to open an engineering analysis of the alleged throttle problems. Typically, Acura Legend owners report their cars idle normally in park, but race out of control when shifted into either drive or reverse, said the center, a private organization often at odds with the auto industry and its regulators. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> has conducted three investigations into another <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> model, the Accord, without ordering a recall, the center said. The center said it has reports of at least 120 Accord sudden acceleration accidents resulting in three deaths. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> recalled 4,500 of its 1988 Civics in November because of speed fluctuation when the cars were idling, the center said.

<HEAD>Premiums Flying As Cooler Boom Fades; Overall Wine Industry Down</HEAD>

 Demand for higher-priced <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> premium wines surged as the four-year boom in wine coolers deflated in 1987, dragging down the overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wine market, an industry observer says. Some <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wineries even had to go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> State for their chardonnays because the growing demand for premium table wines coincided with a short crop, according to a year-end industry report by <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredrikson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gomberg </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fredrikson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's leading wine business consultants. The report was released this week. The premium segment of the industry was worth $ 740 million in sales last year, up 21 percent from 1986. <PERSON> Fredrikson </PERSON> pointed out that the premiums represented only 20 percent of all <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table wine gallonage but 45 percent of table wine revenues. Burdened by a weak dollar that forced importers to raise prices, sales of foreign wines plummeted 21 percent last year, on top of a 25 percent decline the year before. Ironically, one of the few bright spots in the import picture was <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Riunite, scoring a 110 percent improvement on its cooler-type peach drink. At the same time, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s jug wines _ a $ 4 billion-plus segment with more than 80 percent of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wine sales _ continued downward for the fifth straight year as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trend toward better wines continued to rise. <PERSON> Fredrikson </PERSON>, who a couple of years ago could see no halt to the cooler phenomenon, described last year as a `` meltdown.'' From a few gallons in 1981, shipments of the fizzy blends of white wine, watgger and fruit juices rose to 8 million gallons in 1983, 34 million in 1984, 88 million in 1985, and 120 million in 1986, but then added only 2 million more last year. But for all their fiscal flatness, coolers accounted for more than 21 percent of the 423.8 million gallons <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vintners sold last year. The `` cooler wars,'' as <PERSON> Fredrikson </PERSON> put it, saw the lead change from the originator, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cooler, to <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bartles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jaymes </PERSON>, and now to <ORGANIZATION> Seagrams </ORGANIZATION> with 31 percent of the market. There were two major growth areas in the champagne category, despite a 6 percent overall dip in sales. After its 48 percent surge in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>'s Champagne posted a 17 percent improvement last year with 1.3 million cases. <PERSON> Korbel </PERSON> continued the market leader with another record year, up 16 percent on shipments of more than 1.3 million cases. The showing also reflected the increasing popularity of the expensive `` methode champenoise'' way of making champagne _ fermentation in the individual bottles rather than bulk in stainless steel vats. The top five <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wine companies start with <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, the world's largest wine producer with 39.9 percent of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s total wine sales, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Heublein </ORGANIZATION>, 10.2 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Vintners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, 9.1 percent; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cooler, 5 percent, and Guild, 4 percent Prices were mostly up last year in the heavily consumed chablis category. The top average price paid for the popular 1.5-liter case was $ 14.27, while the favorite bar item _ the 18-liter box _ went for $ 15.25 each. At $ 1.50 to $ 2.50 a glass, the bar makes up to 1,400 percent profit on each box.

<HEAD>Parliamentary Uproar Over Tax Cut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> announced <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first budget surplus in nearly 20 years today and was shouted down by opposition legislators in one of the unruliest annual budget presentations in parliamentary history The deputy speaker twice suspended the proceedings during <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s speech, and opposition socialist Laborites chanted `` Shame, Shame'' as he announced huge tax cuts for the rich. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said he was slashing the top tax bracket from 60 percent to 40 percent. A Scottish legislator, <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Salmond </PERSON>, was expelled after calling the budget an `` obscenity,'' with tax cuts instead of extra spending on health and welfare services. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s speech was halted while legislators voted overwhelmingly to expel <PERSON> Salmond </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> reduced the basic rate of tax from 27 percent to 25 percent, and cut <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s six tax brackets to just two _ 25 percent and 40 percent. The 40 percent top tax rate _ down from a 60 percent top bracket _ will be payable on income over 19,300 pounds -LRB- $ 35,700 -RRB- a year. The measures were the most sweeping changes since Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> came to power on a platform of cutting taxes, encouraging private enterprise and curbing inflation and state spending. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> announced last autumn the size of the $ 290 billion budget for the fiscal year ending in 1989. Today, armed with the battered leather budget box, the chancellor disclosed how the government will raise the money. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, declaring Conservative government has transformed the British economy, announced a surplus of 3 billion pounds -LRB- $ 5.5 billion -RRB- in the budget. `` Tax breaks for the rich, poll tax -LRB- a new property tax -RRB- for the poor and nothing in it for the health service _ it's an absolute and utter obscenity,''' shouted <PERSON> Salmond </PERSON>, of the Scottish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. His expulsion went ahead after a vote that delayed <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s speech for 12 minutes The two other Scottish nationalists in the 650-member Commons walked out in sympathy. As the session resumed, Laborites murmured restively as <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> continued to list tax cuts. The opposition broke into a new uproar, amid shouts of `` rich man's budget.'' Conservative legislators, opposite the Laborites from the facing green leather benches, yelled `` Quiet'' and `` Sit Down.'' The proceedings then were suspended a second time. Parliamentary officials hustled four uniformed nurses out of the public gallery after they shouted slogans in defense of state-funded health care. `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is not safe in your hands. Thanks a lot <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>,'' one shouted. Despite buoyant revenues and economic growth, today's budget was clouded by a split between Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> on how to handle the soaring British pound. Even with eve-of-budget hesitancy in currency markets, the pound finished at $ 1.85 on Monday, up 8 cents in a week, and at 3.08 West German marks, well above the 3-mark level central to <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s strategy of keeping a rein on sterling A high pound hurts British exports. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> last week ruled out such intervention as immediate pound sales by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> and lower interest rates to depress sterling on the grounds that the moves would fuel inflation. A budget focusing on tax reform rather than huge giveaways would likely be another boost for the pound. The budget surplus is due partly to higher-than-anticipated revenues from increased wages and company profits. In line with a string of trim, low deficit budgets since Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> won power in 1979, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> originally predicted a $ 7.4 billion deficit in 1988-89, and revised that to $ 1.85 billion last autumn.

<HEAD>Company Showing Device That Defibrillates Hearts Over Phone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A device that can jolt a fibrillating heart back to normal over the telephone is scheduled for a demonstration in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday, three months after it won government approval. The MDphone System is aimed at heart patients who are at risk of cardiac fibrillation, in which the heart twitches uselessly because its electrical system has gone haywire. About 450,000 Americans die of heart attacks annually before ever reaching a hospital, and immediate defibrillation could revive some of the victims, says the maker of the MDphone System, <ORGANIZATION> Medphone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The system consists of a $ 7,000 home unit and a $ 30,000 base station installed at a nearby hospital. When a patient goes into defibrillation, someone else at home is supposed to open the MDphone case and put a pair of chest pads on the victim. The rest of the work is handled over the phone by the hospital, including monitoring of the heart and, if necessary, triggering of the defibrillator. Medphone is still negotiating to make its first sales of the device, which was cleared for marketing last December by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The company says it is in active talks with a number of hospitals. <PERSON> Medphone </PERSON> said hospitals could charge patients $ 250 to $ 300 per month, which would cover the lease or rental of the equipment and the round-the-clock response service. It says hospitals could charge additional fees for interpretation of electrocardiograms and, if necessary, defibrillation. The main competition for the MDphone System would be implantable defibrillators, which are about the size of a pack of cigarettes, cost roughly $ 14,000 and have been on the market for about 2 -LCB- years.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment partnership has filed a class action lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, alleging it was responsible for millions of dollars of losses during the October market crash. The lawsuit, filed Friday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, also names the <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which processes all securities options trades in the nation. The investment partnership, M & amp; M, sued on behalf of the more than 1,000 customers it said traded in excess of $ 40 million worth of a November series of stock options on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 100 stock index. The investors contend the exchange violated its rules by not halting trade in stock index options in a more timely fashion. It said the exchange operated a `` fraud and deceit upon the plaintiffs'' by failing to maintain a fair and equitable market. Exchange spokesman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Moulds </PERSON> said it `` wo n't comment on pending litigation.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hender </PERSON>, executive vice president of the clearing corporation, said he could n't comment because he had not seen the lawsuit. The lawsuit contends that on the morning of Oct. 20, the day after the crash, <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M put in an order to buy November put options. A put option gives the buyer the right to sell stock index contracts at a set price before the expiration date. The system in use at the exchange requires that opening trades be rotated among the various contracts, and that free trading begins only when the rotation is completed, the lawsuit said. The average length of the opening rotation is 12 to 15 minutes, it said, but in the hectic aftermath of Black Monday, opening rotation took 2 hours and 30 minutes. By the time M & amp; M's contracts were executed, prices `` were arbitrarily high and grossly inflated,'' the lawsuit contends. `` Once they placed that order, they could n't withdraw it,'' said attorney <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasky </PERSON>, who represents <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M. `` They were locked in.'' The lawsuit contends that for the investors to have broken even, the Dow Jones Industrial Average would have had to plunge an additional 50 percent by Nov. 20, the expiration date of the options. M & amp; M invested $ 23,400 and lost 90 percent of it, <PERSON> Lasky </PERSON> said Tuesday. The class of investors, which had put up more than $ 40 million, probably lost close to 90 percent, too, he said. The lawsuit asks that the investors be reimbursed.

 Stock prices were little changed today in light, lackluster trading. Analysts said the market drifted in a narrow range as both institutional and retail investors remained on the sidelines while awaiting fresh economic news due out later in the week. The government is scheduled to release January's merchandise trade figures on Thursday, just ahead of the year's first `` triple witching hour,'' when a group of options and futures on stock indexes will expire simultaneously. While concern over the two events dampened activity in the previous trading session, analysts indicated market participants may be overestimating the impact both the trade figures and the witching hour might have. Analysts noted that the market reacted quickly when trade figures were released in the previous two months. Similarly, the past couple of witching hours have been rather uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program traders.

 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, buffeted by bad loans and wary customers, announced Tuesday it will turn to federal regulators for help in restructuring and rebuilding its ailing financial reserves. Bank analysts said the move could bode a buyout or merger for Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION>, the largest bank holding company in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> and the 13th-largest in the nation. The announcement came as Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> struggled against a Tuesday deadline for debt holders to submit their securities in a rescue plan that represents the second-largest bank bailout in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks have been plagued by the state's economic downturn sparked by the sharp fall in oil prices in recent years and its ensuing fallout on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' lifeblood industies of oil and real estate. First RepublicBank officials said they are holding preliminary discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to restructure and recapitalize the company. `` The decision to approach the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> is, in our judgment, important to providing a stable environment for First RepublicBank's customers,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronterhouse </PERSON>, the company's chairman and chief executive officer. `` Naturally, we had hoped to work our way out of the current difficulties without assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` However, we are now announcing this changed course of action to help clear away any concerns our customers may have.'' First RepublicBank spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> said the loss of about $ 600 million in deposits over a five-day period last month prompted the need to seek federal help. `` Certainly two or three weeks ago we did n't believe this would be necessary,'' he said. First RepublicBank officials tried last month to combat rumors that the bak was considering merging with another financial institution, taking the unusual step of buying full-page newspaper ads to assure customers their deposits were safe. <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> said he did n't believe the latest development would lead more depositors to withdraw their money because `` we expect our customers will understand that their money is protected.'' The bank is discussing whether to pursue open-bank assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. Generally, that aid comes only if the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> determines that keeping a bank open would be less costly to the government than letting the bank fail. An <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> bailout of that kind would require regulators to determine that the bank would fail without help. But <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an independent bank consultant from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said, `` Most people feel like there will be a buyer.'' <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannigan </PERSON>, an analyst and vice president of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision by <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> to seek federal aid will renew confidence in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banking. `` It should lend further stability to the banking system in the state,'' she said. `` There has been a great deal of negative press, and the fact that they are seeking some kind of <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> assistance should create some additional confidence in the system.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said that if it takes an infusion of federal money to get the bank on its feet, `` that's the way it's going to have to be.'

<HEAD>Lilly Says Trust Fund For Anti-Arthritis Drug Users Is
`Unnecessary'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> rejected on Tuesday a demand by British lawmakers that the pharmaceutical giant set up a trust fund for victims of a discontinued anti-arthritis medication. The demand was made Monday by 100 British lawmakers who signed a letter to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer. Hundreds of former users of the anti-arthritis drug Oraflex, sold in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> under the name Opren, sued the Indianapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> in the mid-1980s, claiming the drug caused severe side effects, including liver and kidney disorders. The drug also was linked to several deaths. <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> withdrew the drug from the market in 1982. Most of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawsuits have been settled and, earlier this year, the company reached out-of-court settlements with 1,320 British claimants. Last month, consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> called for an international boycott of <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> to protest the British settlements, which he said averaged $ 3,000. `` It's just inconceivable in this day and age that after 5 -LCB- years of litigation <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> could settle for so little money,'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said in February. The British lawmakers asked <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> to set up the trust fund to bring the British compensation in line with the settlements in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The company has never divulged the amount of the settlements reached in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cases, but one <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> man won a $ 6 million judgment against the company. `` Suggestions that one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> verdict against <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> is the standard of settlement of all other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cases are false and misleading,'' the company said Tuesday in a prepared release. `` For third parties now to call for a trust fund for Opren claimants over and above the recently negotiated settlement is contrary to the spirit of the entire process,'' the company said. `` The concept of a trust fund is unnecessary. The settlement, which has been endorsed by 98 percent of the claimants, is appropriate.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> affiliate, said last month that 98 percent of the claimants have accepted settlement offers, and that the amount of the Opren settlement was proposed by the claimants' lawyers, and not by the company. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the company had not received a copy of the lawmakers' letter.

<TEXT>
 Business executives testified Tuesday in favor of proposed revisions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trademark law that would allow them to apply for trademark registration before new products are marketed, as foreign companies are allowed to do. Debra Fields, president of <ORGANIZATION> Mrs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, which owns Mrs. Fields Cookies, praised the bill for proposed elimination of an `` expensive and time-consuming'' requirement that a trademark be used in interstate commerce before an application for registration can be filed. `` The new law will eliminate expensive business risks which small businesses can least afford to take,'' she said. She noted that small businesses risk losing thousands of dollars in wasted effort by designing and labeling a trademark for token marketing of an experimental new product in another state, only to discover that the trademark already was registered by another company. The bill would allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens to apply for registration of their trademarks before product plans have been completed. `` It's disturbing that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law currently gives foreign trademark owners an advantage that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses do not have,'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said. The statutory revisions also were endorsed by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kranzow </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Frito-Lay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeForrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Trexler </PERSON>, deputy general counsel of <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedden </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franchise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The corporate witnesses also supported the bill's provisions for removing old trademarks that already are being used, and for prohibiting `` dilution'' of famous trademarks by non-competing manufacturers. As an example of dilution, <PERSON> Trexler </PERSON> cited an instance when a manufacturer of men's undershorts tried to used the <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> bulldog trademark on its products. Such practices are forbidden by 23 states but not under federal law. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations and business organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also had expressed support for the first major revisions in trademark law since 1946 to remove `` cumbersome and uneconomical filing procedures.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it has agreed with a partnership of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to swap cable televison systems in several states. Neither Times Mirror nor the partnership put a value on the deal Tuesday, but analysts estimated it would be worth about $ 740 million, based on an average price of $ 2,000 per subscriber. The companies had announced tentative plans for the exchange in early October, but the details were n't worked out until now, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> said. Times Mirror will turn over to the partnership cable systems serving about 185,000 customers in the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> communities of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nogales </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bullhead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Casa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havasu </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The Conservative government unveiled on Tuesday a sweeping reform of the British tax system, slashing rates for higher income groups in a move that provoked an uproar from the parliamentary opposition. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government also announced a $ 5.55 billion budget surplus, the country's first in almost 20 years. `` Shame, shame!'' and `` Rich man's budget!'' opposition members shouted as Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> presented the annual spring budget statement to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. A Scottish legislator, <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Salmond </PERSON>, was expelled after he called the budget an `` obscenity'' with tax cuts instead of extra spending on health and welfare services. The budget served notice that in her third consecutive term as prime minister, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s faith in her 9-year-old capitalist revolution is undimmed, and that the socialist opposition can expect few concessions. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said the government would abolish four income tax brackets, leaving just two, of 25 percent and 40 percent, in the fiscal year beginning April 1. Tax rates currently range from 27 percent to 60 percent. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s statement was repeatedly disrupted by opposition lawmakers, especially when he announced a huge tax cut to 40 percent for top earners. `` Tax breaks for the rich, poll tax -LRB- a new property tax -RRB- for the poor and nothing in it for the health service _ it's an absolute and utter obscenity!'' shouted <PERSON> Salmond </PERSON>, of the Scottish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A few minutes later, the deputy speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> was forced to suspend proceedings as shouting continued. Four uniformed nurses were ousted from the public gallery for yelling at <LOCATION> Lawson </LOCATION>. Custom dictates a respectful hearing of budget statements, but <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> described <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s budget as a `` tragedy.'' `` This is puny, marginal and negligible for the average people in our society,'' he said. He claimed the surplus came from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil sales, taxes on a `` massive expansion'' of household credit debt, and `` the once-and-for-all sell-off of national assets'' _ a reference to the sale of state-owned industries to the private sector. But <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said: `` This major reform will leave us with one of the simplest systems of income tax in the world.'' The proposed tax changes are part of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s long-term overhaul of the tax system and resemble recent reforms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s goals have been to reduce and simplify taxes and transfer the tax burden from income to spending. Financial markets were buoyed by the statement with the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index closing up 20.4 points at 1,839.9. The pound moved hiher, but its advance was checkedby reported intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, dealers said. The spring Budget Day is when the government announces how it will raise its revenue. The government last autumn announced its planned expenditures of $ 290 billion for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1989. The budget proposals must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION>' 102-seat majority in the 650-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> guarantees their passage. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that the public service borrowing requirement, the most commonly used measure of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s budget deficit, would be in surplus of $ 5.55 billion in the year ending March 31, when the government spent $ 273 billion. It was only the second surplus since the early 1950s. The last, in 1968-69, was about $ 1.1 billion. The government most recently had forecast a deficit for the current year of $ 1.85 billion, down from an original forecast of $ 7.4 billion. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> also said he plans for a similar surplus in the new fiscal year. `` Having achieved it, I intend to stick to it,'' he said. The focus of the statement was on tax reform, however, with <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> saying he planned ultimately to lower the 25-percent tax rate to 20 percent. Under the new system, the higher 40 percent rate will apply to income above $ 35,705. Currently the 27-percent rate applies to income up to $ 33,115, and the top rate of 60 percent is on income above $ 76,220. In her first budget, in June 1979, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> cut the top rate from 83 percent to 60 percent. The lowest rate stood at 33 percent in 1979.

 The dollar gained against most major currencies Tuesday in reaction to weakness in the British pound. Gold prices also rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 446 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $ 441.90 an ounce late Monday. The British pound rose sharply during a budget announcement by Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who announced <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first budget surplus in nearly 20 years and a sweeping tax reform Later, though, the pound fell back as investors cashed in on paper profits and word that the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was selling sterling to stem its rise. As sterling fell, the dollar benefited, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, vice president for foreign exchange in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. Gold and silver strengthened in a speculative run-up.

At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 127.38 yen from 126.78 late Monday. Other dollar rates late Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday, included: 1.6699 West German marks, up from 1.6629; 1.3805 Swiss francs, up from 1.3718; 1.2539 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2572; 5.6660 French francs, up from 5.6395; and 1,237.00 Italian lire, up from 1,231.25.

 Led by a generous jump in purchases of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vehicles, sales of domestic cars and light trucks rose 6.3 percent in early March from a year ago, automakers reported Tuesday. Industry-leader <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, however, did not share the strong sales increases enjoyed by No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and incentive-heavy <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm surprised how strong sales were considering that some consumers had moved their -LRB- March -RRB- purchases into February in expectation of sales incentives expiring,'' said industry analyst <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s combined domestic car and light truck sales were the highest for early March since 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic car sales jumped 21.4 percent to 68,859 in early March from 50,407 a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> held 32.5 percent of the domestic car market, up from 27.7 percent a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s light truck sales rose 18.1 percent to 46,073 in early March from 34,685 a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s share of that market improved to 39.5 percent from 37.4 percent a year ago. Despite its incentives, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic car sales fell 13 percent from early March a year ago and its light truck sales dropped 1.5 percent, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> and other analysts blamed the end-of-February expiration date of most of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s incentive programs for its strong February showing and ensuing weakness in early March. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> later extended the buyer lures into the spring, but only after many consumers had hurried to take advantage of the discounts before they ended. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sweetened its incentives in early March, helping its sales. The eight companies that build cars and trucks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sold 328,437 in the nine selling days from March 1-10, up from 274,626 in eight days a year ago. Sales have improved in each of the seven sales period so far in 1988 compared with the first quarter of 1987, when showrooms were empty because buyers made their pre-tax reform purchases at the end of 1986. The percentage that sales fell or increased is a comparison of average daily sales during the period, not of the straight numbers of vehicles sold in early March this year and last year.

 Stock prices showed little enthusiasm in either direction Tuesday as the market drifted in a quiet, lackluster session. Analysts said investors bided time while awaiting economic news due later in the week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 2.66 points to 2,047.41. But advancing issues slightly outnumbered decliners on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 789 up, 718 down and 477 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume was 133.17 million shares, up slightly from 131.89 million shares in the previous session, which marked the lightest total since Dec. 29. Analysts said market watchers were taking note of the light volume. `` Right now it's telling us nobody cares,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doran </PERSON>, head of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He said there was a `` boycott'' by both institutional and retail investors who are `` waiting for some flow of economic news to get cranked up.'' The government is scheduled to release January's merchandise trade figures on Thursday, just ahead of the year's first `` triple witching hour,'' when a group of options and futures on stock indexes will expire simultaneously. While concern over the two events dampened activity in the previous trading session, analysts indicated market participants may be overestimating the impact both the trade figures and the witching hour might have. Analysts noted that the market reacted quickly when trade figures were released in the previous two months. Similarly, the past couple of witching hours have been rather uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program traders. The transportation sector managed to post a clear, positive trend. Airline stocks rose across the board amid reports that a number of carriers plan to tighten restrictions on discount fares. <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 \ to 79 -LCB-, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> rose ~ to 41 ~, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 -LRB- to 47 -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was up | to 43 First RepublicBank fell \ to 1 -LCB-. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest bank holding company said it might seek a federal bailout. Traders complained that the technology sector failed to help establish a positive trend for the day. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -LCB- to 114 and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> fell 2 -LCB- to 116 \ Auto stocks were off slightly. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was down -LRB- to 24 \, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was down \ to 44 and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged The major automakers reported mixed results for the early March sales period. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market decreased $ 834 million, or 0.03 percent, in value. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 157.59 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 0.07 to 149.99. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 0.66 to 308.55, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.24 to 266.13. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index fell 0.19 to 296.75. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market closed at 376.55, off 0.12.

<HEAD>Metals Prices Show Some Strength</HEAD>

 Precious metals futures moved higher Tuesday, with gold prices approaching recent highs. While there was little on the world financial or political scene to account for the strength, the move put gold in a position to break out of its trading range, analysts said. On other markets, pork belly futures took a nosedive, grains and soybeans were mixed and crude oil was a little higher. `` The price action of gold was very good, but it came out of left field,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was n't any real news; no action in the other markets that would warrant it.'' However, he noted that the gold contract for delivery in April reached a high of $ 448.30 an ounce at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is very close to the highs that were made during a recent consolidation phase were it traded between $ 440 and $ 450,'' he said. Prices had dropped into the mid $ 420s last month. <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> said prices are not likely to break beyond $ 450 on Wednesday, one day ahead of the release of the January balance of trade data. `` But whenever it gets this close to the top of the range, you have to treat it with some respect,'' he said. `` Metals have made a nice recovery from the lows of a few weeks ago,'' said <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>. `` They're well positioned to make a nice move. If we do get favorable trade data, prices have almost no where to go but to break out.'' Gold settled $ 4.40 to $ 5.10 higher with the contract for delivery in April at $ 447.50 a troy ounce; and silver was 12.5 cents higher with March at $ 6.365 a troy ounce. Pork belly futures retreated sharply at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> under data indicating there may be burdensome supplies in the summer. `` Bellies collapsed late in the day following a report of a big movement into storage,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, an anlayst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said 3.7 million pounds of pork bellies were stored during the week ended March 12. `` This was at the top end of expectations,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>. Prices could rebound if the market comes to believe there's going to be a need for a lot of bellies, he said, but right now it's concerned about the ramifications for an oversupply later this summer Cattle futures were weakened by profit taking, said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>. Live cattle settled .18 cent lower to .10 cent higher with the April contract at 73.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent lower to .32 cent higher with March at 82.72 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .40 cent lower with April at 45.20 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .95 cent to 1.32 cents lower with March at 52.62 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. It was a sluggish session with little price movement in either direction. `` This is the reflection of the indecisiveness of the market today in these slow conditions,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was no news overnight to move prices either way. Wheat was \ cent lower to 1 cent higher with the contract for delivery in March settling at $ 2.95 a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with March at $ 1.98 a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 3 \ cents lower with March at $ 1.88 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 6.13 -RCB- a bushel Crude oil futures moved a little higher, but the market remained confused and cautious, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` People are waiting for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to say ` We've got a problem,' and deal with it, or for prices to simply go lower,'' he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude oil was 9 cents higher with the April contract at $ 15.68 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent lower to .13 cent higher with April at 43.47 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .05 cent lower to .02 cent higher with April at 44.38 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Desert Partners Mounts Proxy Fight for Directors' Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION> has begun a soliciting proxies from shareholders for the election of directorships of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which recently spurned an unsolicited $ 1.9 billion buyout offer from the investor group. Desert Partners, the company's largest shareholder with 9.8 percent of the stock, is fielding a rival slate for the six seats at stake in the upcoming election. USG has 15 directors. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> rejected <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' $ 42-a-share buyout offer and said it was considering defense strategies that might include the sale of a major block of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> stock to a third party to block an unfriendly takeover. The proxy battle by <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilmen <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, will climax May 11 at <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting in its headquarters city of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed at $ 35.87 -LCB- a share, down 25 cents in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. Desert Partners said in its proxy statement that even if it wins all six seats, it still would not control the building materials company. `` However, a vote in favor of the election of the Desert Partners nominees should indicate your support for the offer,'' the proxy statement read. Shareholders will receive two proxy statements, one from the company and the other from <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>.
