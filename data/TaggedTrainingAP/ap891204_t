<TEXT>
 A year after an earthquake smashed northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> into rubble, the city of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> is a shantytown of mud and memories. The Garapetyans do laundry by boiling their clothes in a bucket on a tiny wood stove. The stove also heats a makeshift cabin they built from remains of their former apartment building next door. Far above, rain lashes the wallpaper of their old living room on the fourth floor, which was exposed when the side of the building sheared off. `` We're afraid of living in a large building again,'' <PERSON> Meruzhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garapetyan </PERSON> said. Popular songs speak of the disaster of Dec. 7, 1988, when an earthquake measuring 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale killed at least 25,000 people and destroyed the homes of 500,000 more. `` Oh earthquake, what have you done?'' one asks. `` Why did you leave so many parents without their children? ... You covered them with stones and dirt and left their parents in tears.'' The Armenian relief agency Search says 20,000 people still are missing, 2,000 of them children. Daily life is slogging through mud, relying on relatives and wondering when normality will return. A quake of 7.1 magnitude in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area on Oct. 17 killed only 66 people. Damage was estimated at $ 7 billion, but much of the destruction was cleared and service restored within weeks. In <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, <PERSON> Vartan </PERSON> <PERSON> Oganisyan </PERSON> and his family of five live in a shack made from bits of sheet metal, wood scraps, tar paper and salvaged window frames. Other families crowd into half-shattered buildings, construction huts, army tents, round Mongolian yurts, abandoned railway cars and even gasoline tanks fitted with doors and windows. A few open cooking fires can be seen in the twilight. Electrical power is intermittent as <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> enters the bitter Soviet winter. Children bundle up for classes in temporary, unheated buildings. They wake up crying at night and run from classrooms in fright at the slightest noise. After school they play `` earthquake,'' recreating the disaster in the muddy streets. Hundreds of people go to the huge city cemetery after work. Many graves are marked only by the flowers relatives leave. <PERSON> Sofik </PERSON> <PERSON> Torunyan </PERSON>, who lost both children, was there on what would have been her daughter's 20th birthday, with a cake fashioned from carnations. `` Oh, my young daughter! Oh, my love!'' she wailed, holding onto a friend. `` Why did n't I die, too, so I would not have to live without you?'' People struggle on, helping each other. Hospitality and pride remain. A dozen families share the only bathroom on their block that still works. A boy paints the window frame in his family's shack. Visitors are offered coffee and sweets, but often there is no electricity to boil water. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tumanyan </PERSON>, who lives in the ground floor of a severely cracked five-story building, insists that `` we're making great progress.'' She concentrates on the vast stretches cleared of broken concrete and twisted metal, not the rubble remaining. The town of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> was leveled. Kirovakan and 300 villages were shattered. In <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, which had 235,000 residents, the quake destroyed 99 nine-story apartment buildings, 10 schools and every factory, officials said. Reconstruction has lagged badly. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, the Soviet premier, said in November that the crash program to rebuild in two years already was a year behind schedule, meaning virtually nothing had been accomplished. Residents blame disorganization, central planning's failure to supply enough building materials and a two-month blockade of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> by ethnic enemies in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Many foreigners building schools and hospitals went home because supply shipments were held up on rail lines in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. By early November, only three new buildings had been completed, all by the army for the army. <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambartsumyan </PERSON>, chairman of the city <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> committee, still hopes to move 4,000 families into a vast new suburb before year's end, but even that would be only one-fifth as many as planned. For now, <PERSON> Ambartsumyan </PERSON> is concentrating on getting the remaining homeless among the 190,000 people now living in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> into construction huts and other temporary housing, and getting heat for them before winter. <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Asaturyan </PERSON> lives in one such hut, generously called a `` little house'' in Russian but in reality a two-room insulated packing crate. She and her family of five must haul water from a block away, use nearby bushes as a toilet and travel to a relative's place for showers. Her washing flaps over a sea of mud. Mrs. <PERSON> Asaturyan </PERSON> is grateful, however, because they used to be in the remains of the towel factory where she once worked, and where 30 of her co-workers were killed. Her `` little house,'' like thousands of others, showed up without a door, window glass, heater, wiring or furniture. It was vandalized en route, apparently by <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON>, whom the Armenians accuse of stealing or destroying relief supplies. When asked about the Soviet leadership's promise to rebuild in two years, Mrs. <PERSON> Asaturyan </PERSON> said: `` I'll be glad if I get a home within five years.'' About 20,000 of the homeless are scheduled to receive apartments in the new suburb as sections are completed over 18 months. A forest of 129 cranes towers over the site, and buildings faced with local salmon-colored stone gleam in the sun. Because nine-story apartment blocks shoddily built of pre-formed concrete panels collapsed in the quake, the new buildings are made by assembling vault-like precast rooms, foreman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Pogosov </PERSON> said. None is more than four stories high. In May, a commission of the ruling Politburo blamed most of the deaths on shoddy construction and gave its findings to prosecutors. No charges have been filed, said <PERSON> Haik </PERSON> <PERSON> Minasyan </PERSON>, an Armenian government spokesman. Only a few projects are under way in the city itself. On the central square, a statue of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> looks over a scene of devastation: a ruined school, department store, government building, post office, shops and a sock factory. Cafes and movie theaters are gone. So are most food stores, and shopping sometimes amounts to picking over piles of cabbages and potatoes at what remains of the bus station. <PERSON> Ambartsumyan </PERSON> said experts had ruled out reconstruction on half the original city lots because the ground is too unstable.

 Fighting intensified Tuesday between rebels and loyal forces in the <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> <LOCATION> financial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, where about 2,000 foreigners, including more than 200 Americans, have been trapped in hotels for four days. Efforts to evacuate foreigners held by the rebels appeared to have stalled early Tuesday. A 60mm mortar round slammed into a squatter settlement near the <ORGANIZATION> Makati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> about 6 a.m. -LRB- 5 p.m. EST Monday -RRB-. Ten people were taken to the hospital, including a 6-year-old girl who died. Two bombs exploded in the capital late Monday, wounding two people. It was unclear if they were related to the coup attempt, which began Friday and has killed at least 71 people and wounded more than 500. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> recommended Tuesday morning that Americans living in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> remain in their homes but avoid upper floors, lest they become targets for snipers. At least three people were killed in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> on Monday and 15, including one American, were wounded by sniper fire and shells. Troops loyal to the government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, backed by three armored personnel carriers, began moving under cover of fire toward the hotel district where the foreigners are. `` Are we going to win?'' a colonel asked his men at the end of a briefing. `` Yes, sir!'' they shouted. He told his men not to fire unless they had a rebel in their sights. The Japanese Embassy recommended that Japanese citizens living in parts of the posh <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> district not under rebel control leave for safer areas of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. It estimated 500 Japanese remained in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>, including about 300 trapped in the hotels. A statement telephoned to news organizations from a rebel spokesman, Capt. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yen </PERSON>, said the insurgents would release the foreigners to dispel suspicions they were being held hostage. The statement said the foreigners would be free to leave the hotels at 10 a.m. Tuesday and would be taken to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s airport aboard shuttle buses. Yen said the move did not indicate the rebels were about to end their bid to oust Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` That's the farthest thing that we could do,'' he said. `` We pledged our lives to this cause. We will hold the line to the last drop of our blood.'' About 400 mutineers from the elite <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> were holding 22 buildings in the <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, where many foreign embassies and residences of foreign diplomats and businessmen lie. About 400 rebels continued to occupy <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Their leader refused to surrender and threatened to blow up the base's planes. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on arriving back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> superpower summit and following a visit with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> to express concern for the lives of Americans in the <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> hotels. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as telling Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>: `` ` I understand some Americans are in the hotels... Can we get those people out? I'm very concerned about their lives and their safety.''' `` She assured him they were doing everything possible to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Then the president ended the conversation by saying, ` I appreciate your concern for the civilians. We're proud of you for standing up with great courage. We want to see you succeed.''' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided fresh military supplies to the Aquino government and promised $ 25,000 in help for civilian hospitals, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. The Japanese are planning to send three tons of emergency aid, including food, water and medicine to its embassy, said a foreign ministry official in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Filipino Tourism Undersecretary <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Alunan </PERSON> prepared about 20 buses to go into the battle zone and evacuate tourists to the airport. <PERSON> Alunan </PERSON> broadcast a statement over <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio stations telling the rebels the routes the buses would take and that each would carry a white flag. As the first buses prepared to enter the area, heavy firing broke out. Officials stopped the buses in order to contact rebel leaders by telephone to make sure the deal was still on. Officials planned first to evacuate guests from the Intercontinental Hotel and if the operation was successful to clear out other buildings. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Huchel </PERSON> said 215 Americans were believed in three hotels in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>. Hospital sources identified the American wounded Monday as <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissburg </PERSON>. They said he was hit in the arm by glass when a bullet shattered the window of his room at the Peninsula Hotel. They did not know his hometown. The <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> quoted military reports as saying nine <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen from <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, were among the trapped Americans. Loyal forces said the rebels were contained in 22 buildings in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>. Snipers exchanged fire through the night. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Julich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businesswoman trapped in the Intercontinental Hotel, was contacted by telephone and said, `` Literally, we're in the middle. -LRB- We're -RRB- now low on food. There are babies in the building, and there is no baby food, and the mothers are hysterical.'' The city's international airport reopened Monday but domestic air service was indefinitely postponed. Schools were closed but government employees were ordered to return to work except in the <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> area. Officials reported shortages of food and fuel. An explosion Monday rocked the compound of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. There were no injuries. A second bomb went off in the <LOCATION> Ermita </LOCATION> entertainment district, damaging an unoccupied minibus and shattering windows. Two women were injured by flying glass. Monday morning, the estimated 390 rebel holdouts in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> _ members of the army's <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> _ refused appeals to surrender and fired at soldiers and civilians who approached their strongholds. The mutinous soldiers claim Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, swept to power in a 1986 military-civilian uprising that toppled President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, has failed to deal effectively with the country's Communist insurgency and economic problems. This is the sixth and most serious attempt to overthrow her. One of the coup leaders is <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, a cashiered lieutenant colonel who once supported Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> but later led an August 1987 attempt to overthrow her. He remained at large.

 His family has n't seen <PERSON> Araik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukasyan </PERSON> since the earthquake destroyed his school a year ago, but they speak of him celebrating his 13th birthday soon and hope a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> psychic can tell them where. `` We wait to find him alive,'' said his mother, <PERSON> Galine </PERSON>, weeping as she pulled out <PERSON> Araik </PERSON>'s school portrait. She hopes publicity will bring word from someone who has taken him in, if that happened. The fourth grader vanished in the rubble of School No. 9 along with more than 500 other people when the earthquake hit <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> during school hours Dec. 7, 1988. Authorities say it killed 25,000 people, but the Armenian relief agency Search says 20,000 more still are missing, including 2,000 children. `` They are not counted on the list of the dead or on the list of those evacuated,'' said <PERSON> Ashot </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgyan </PERSON>, director of the Search office in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. He said he had no way of knowing how many of the 20,000 were dead and how many were just separated from their families. `` We are now continuing the search for children, particularly orphans, who were sent in groups to various points in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and are still there in sanatoriums and resorts,'' <PERSON> Georgyan </PERSON> said. Many parents, like the Sukasyans, believe officials may have lost track of some evacuees. <PERSON> Larissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vagashakovna </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> office of Search, said she had asked in vain for state television to show pictures of the missing children. `` It's impossible to forget the faces of these parents,'' she said. `` They have n't found the corpse and they have n't found the child. Where have they disappeared to?'' <PERSON> Araik </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Narina </PERSON>, also was in School No. 9 when it crumpled. She escaped, and when her mother came running from home, <PERSON> Narina </PERSON> cried: `` Momma, I am alive, but I ca n't find my brother!'' For a month after the earthquake, the <PERSON> Sukasyan </PERSON> family watched workers claw through the concrete and dust that had been School No. 9. Searchers found the bodies, or identifiable parts of bodies, of 420 students and 26 teachers. There was no sign of 100 others, including <PERSON> Araik </PERSON>. `` There were people where they found only one leg, and identified the shoe or the skirt, and they buried that,'' said <PERSON> Lida </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryan </PERSON>, a teacher at another school and a friend of the family. The Sukasyans searched hospitals, opened every one of thousands of coffins at the cemetery and telephoned relief agencies in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. They found no sign of their son and cling to the hope that someone took him away. `` In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, there is a woman who can see where someone is by looking at his picture. We hope she can help,'' <PERSON> Araik </PERSON>'s mother said. Then she was worried again, because reports say the psychic's powers only work with an original photograph `` This is a copy,'' she said, staring at her son's young, serious face.

 How do hard-working, mature <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> law students relax after a hard day of studying for final exams? `` The favorite is Play-Doh,'' law library secretary <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said Monday. `` We go through a lot of Play-Doh. They say it's really relaxing. The colorful modeling clay is in the law library's toy room, an area stocked with marbles, puzzles, board games and Far Side cartoon books, as well as coffee and food. It began three years ago and re-opened Wednesday in the library's <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> room for the school's 2 -LCB- - week final examination period `` It's just really to relieve tension and stress,'' Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` It's a chance to do something besides study and hit the law books.'' Playing Battleship or marbles in the toy room was often the only relief for students who studied as much as 20 hours a day for final exams, said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Holling </PERSON>, who graduated from the law school last year. `` After you study all day, there's just a point where you ca n't study any more and ca n't absorb any more,'' she said `` This sounds pretty childish, but we did those things.'' The toy room was the idea of law librarian <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitchett </PERSON>, who started similar toy rooms at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` She said to me the second year she was here, ` I think we should have a play room for the students,' and I said, ` Just what am I supposed to do?''' Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` She said we should get some puzzles and coloring books, and I said, ` Are you serious?''' Ms. <PERSON> Fitchett </PERSON> was out of town Monday and unavailable for comment. Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the library has n't heard any complaints about the toy room. But she said one problem can be how the Play-Doh is used. She said the colorful modeling clay was used after the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bengals </ORGANIZATION>' victory over the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday to modify a statue of President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, a graduate of the school. `` I came into the library this morning and he had on a <ORGANIZATION> Bengals </ORGANIZATION>' helmet, and I said, ` Oh, no,''' she said Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the library plans to keep the toy room open only during test periods, despite students' pleas. `` They'd like us to have it all year long, but it's too much of a mess,'' she said.

 It's the laugh. That obnoxious giggle that ends in a full-fledged snort. That's the mark of true nerd. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> has it. Naturally. He is the founder, president and ideological spokesman for the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nerds </ORGANIZATION> and Geeks _ or SONG _ at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. If `` Veritas'' -LRB- truth -RRB- is the motto of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and `` Vanitas'' is the motto of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lampoon </ORGANIZATION>, then the slogan of SONG is `` Veritas is more important than Vanitas,'' explained <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, 20, a junior majoring in math. `` The kind of people we're looking for are very interested in what they're studying. Not as worried about _ like _ what other people think about them,'' said <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> who punctuates his sentences with `` like'' a lot. `` Truth is more important than to look good,'' he added. Everyone knows or has known a nerd or a geek. A nerd was that brainy math major in college, the one with the thick glasses, the perpetual pocket calculator and plaid shirt. The geek is the guy _ or gal _ who wore mismatched socks or strange color combinations and walked to the beat of a drummer no one else heard. Nerds, however, go on to invent amazing new machines and make millions on the patents. Geeks go on to found new companies and become the CEO featured on Fortune's cover for maverick style. Nerds and geeks always have the last laugh. Will nerds inherit the earth? No, but they might just save it, according to <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>. The first step, he says, is to help take the stigma off students who live to study, not party. SONG, organized in mid-October by <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, aims to do that with meetings, speakers and other activities. `` Basically it's putting academics ahead of social life.'' With about 35 members, SONG meets weekly and fosters discussions on how to study better and improve academic standings. `` We talk about _ like _ why grades are important to us or how we see relationships, which may seem strange for nerds and geeks to talk about,'' said <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>. And he laughed that nerdy laugh. Future plans for SONG include lectures, off-beat dances for those slightly out of step and a special `` procrastination hot line.'' This would involve a `` kind, caring and generous counselor'' to talk with students who simply ca n't get down to work. `` I think students procrastinate more than anyone else. It's amazing how much time I spend procrastinating,'' <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said A hot line could get students `` on the road to recovery. In 10 minutes they'd be sitting down and getting to work.'' <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> had been thinking about organizing some kind of club since he entered <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. `` Freshman year I found myself very isolated. For the first time in my life I could not concentrate on studies. No organization that would, like, help me concentrate on studies.'' So he thought up the name <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nerds </ORGANIZATION> and Geeks, registered it with the proper <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> authorities and began having meetings. Most members are math majors, but other disciplines are represented as well, such as Sanskrit. The club's graduate student adviser <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fridman </PERSON> has written a `` Nerd Manifesto'' about the dangers of anti-intellectualism. Yet the alumni adviser is the assistant coach of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> wrestling team, demonstrating that nerds and jocks are n't necessarily mutually exclusive. `` The role of women in SONG is n't any different from that of men. We are equal opportunity nerds,'' said freshman <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Tulenko </PERSON>, an 18-year-old biochemistry major. There's a funny saying going around <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, `` Blessed are the nerds and geeks for they will become trendsetters,'' <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said. And then he laughed like nerd.

 A showdown between three Pentecostal ministers and a prosecutor over the confidentiality of a burglary suspect's confession in church ended when the man pleaded guilty to grand larceny. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, who was to have gone on trial today, entered the plea Monday under an agreement reached at a hearing before <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, 35, had been charged with the more serious crime of breaking and entering. `` It's over with,'' said a jubilant Rev. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiles </PERSON>. `` We do n't have to testify, nor do we have to refuse to testify.'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>'s hearing came after <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> refused for the second time to excuse Mrs. <PERSON> Hiles </PERSON>, 51; her husband, the Rev. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiles </PERSON>, the 58-year-old founder and pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Word </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deliverance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>; and the Rev. <PERSON> Wilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Maconaughey </PERSON> from subpoenas issued by county Prosecutor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> IV. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> carpenter who has been held at the Eastern Regional Jail in lieu of $ 15,000 bond since January, was sentenced to a year in the county jail, with credit for time served. `` I'm happy, the whole church is happy,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from jail. `` I did n't want to see the ministers go to jail. And I should be out in a month if everything goes right.'' Last December, a sobbing <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> interrupted a service at the church, confessing that he did n't try to stop the break-in at his uncle's building supply store. The ministers had said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> wanted them to testify at <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>'s trial, and maintained authorities had crossed the boundary between God's work and their own <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> first refused to block the subpoenas Nov. 15, ruling that state law does not protect confessions made to clergy. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last week refused to hear the ministers' challenge <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> are the only states that do not protect confessions made to ministers or priests in criminal cases, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gay </PERSON>, the ministers' lawyer. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, however, does allow statements made to clergy about divorce proceedings to be kept secret, <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said earlier that just before Christmas he told the congregation that he watched and did nothing as another man broke into his uncle's store last December. He denied having a role in the robbery. `` It was such a burden on my heart, I just had to go to my church and get it off my chest,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said. Gay said another attorney has contacted him about drafting legislation to protect clergy and penitents in similar situations. `` I was disappointed the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> did n't take this opportunity to examine the issue,'' he said. `` It's a fundamental issue that cries out to be heard.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution provides for freedom of religion. Gay also argued that the state constitution prohibits anyone from being subpoenaed, jailed or arrested based upon a religious belief. The importance of protecting confessions made to clergy has been recognized since the days of the Roman Empire, according to the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> professor of theology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION>. `` Society has said that it is of paramount importance that people be able to confide in clergymen or attorneys or their doctors without fear of it being disclosed,'' said <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON>, who has taught a course preparing seminarians to hear confessions. However, <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON> added that the ministers' case may have been weakened because <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> gave his confession publicly. Public confession of sins is a basic tenet of the Pentacostal church. `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> never took anyone aside and had them confess their sins in private,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hiles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hiles </PERSON> said the church's jail ministry had been hurt since inmates heard of the subpoenas. `` They do n't know if they can trust us anymore,'' <PERSON> Hiles </PERSON> said. `` They're saying ` Why should I tell you anything? If I do, they might force you to say it in court.'''

 An 8-year-old girl whose life was cut short by AIDS was laid to rest Monday with balloons, songs and a procession past the federal courthouse where she won her fight go to school. In a 90-minute service at a funeral home, <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was eulogized as a frail, innocent child barely 3 feet tall who never learned to speak but taught adults the language of love. `` <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> taught us to hug and to kiss,'' said her mother, <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON>. `` She takes a part of me with her.'' At <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>, the mentally disabled girl's small, white casket was opened and Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> kissed her adopted daughter goodbye. Mourners released balloons into the air, and the casket was lowered into the ground. Friends were invited to throw of colored beads into the grave along with the traditional handfuls of dirt. Strands of the colorful glass beads which <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> liked had been placed around her neck, and her Raggedy Ann doll laid on her chest. She was in a white dress with blue ribbons. The funeral home was decorated with small balloons. Larger red and purple balloons adorned the four white limousines that carried relatives and friends on the 15-mile procession to the cemetery, passing <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s school, school board offices and the courthouse. More than 125 people who gathered at the funeral home watched a slide show that showed the wide-eyed smiling girl at home, the beach, school, the county fair _ and the hospital. Playing in the background was `` Everybody's Child,'' a song composed by family friend <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told mourners that <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> was `` a little girl with a gigantic heart -LRB- who -RRB- taught us so many things _ love, respect.'' Speech therapist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> McClowrey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> did not learn to speak, but `` spoke so loud to all those who were willing to hear.'' `` She showed me that loving is all there is,'' he said, his voice breaking. `` It was interesting to meet someone who turned the tables on me.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> adopted <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>, who died a week ago, when she was 11 months old after hearing a radio appeal for a sickly child abandoned in a hospital in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Four years later, the family learned that <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> had acquired immune deficiency syndrome. By the time she was four months old, <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> had received 38 transfusions, and doctors believed she received tainted blood. Education officials tried to restrict <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s instruction to her home, fearing she might transmit AIDS to other pupils. Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> sued, saying the child needed contact with other children to develop. A federal judge said the child could attend classes only if she sat inside a specially-built glass booth until she was toilet trained and stopped sucking her fingers. Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> appealed and won after a two-year battle. <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> went to school this year, but became too ill to continue after three weeks in class.

 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, having aired the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, is considering probing an even more politically touchy case linked to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s family. Among the institutions that could be spotlighted next by the committee are <ORGANIZATION> Silverado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION>, declared insolvent by regulators in December 1988. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the president's son, served on <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>'s board of directors, resigning just after his father won the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination in 1988 and only four months before the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L's seizure. In a drive to oust top thrift regulator <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> conducted six public hearings this fall focusing on regulators' delay in acting against the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, - based <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to become the nation's largest S & amp; L failure at a cost to taxpayers of $ 2 At the last hearing just before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recessed for Thanksgiving, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, vowed to continue the probe when legislators return in January, expanding it to include other notorious examples of abuse. `` We had scores ... of Lincolns and we're going to look into them. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> is just the first because it was the biggest,'' he said. In response to a question from a reporter, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> could be among the failures highlighted at a future hearing. Committee aides have been gathering material on the case. <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> was declared insolvent by thrift regulators on Dec. 9, 1988, and taxpayer costs could run as high as $ 500 million. The Federal Savings and <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, now part of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the failure to `` substantial dissipation of assets due to alleged violations of laws, rules and regulations.'' According to government sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, regulators are investigating to determine whether to file a civil suit against <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON>'s former officers and directors, which would include <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. A new investigative book on the S & amp; L crisis, `` Inside Job'' by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fricker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Muolo </PERSON>, cites links between <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a director from 1985 until August 1988, and a major customer of Silverado. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oil and gas company, <ORGANIZATION> JNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION>, had a $ 1 million line of credit at <ORGANIZATION> Cherry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which was owned by <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, who received more than $ 40 million in loans from <LOCATION> Silverado </LOCATION>, according to the book. <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> also had business ties to <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizel </PERSON>, a prominent Republican who raised $ 1 million for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroney </PERSON>, a former analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Topeka </ORGANIZATION>, alleges that regulators held off action against <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> because of its political connections, the book says. Aides to <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said no decision has been made about whether to air the <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> case in public hearings. The Lincoln sessions _ even though they targeted Wall, a Republican _ proved more embarrassing for Democrats because they highlighted the efforts of five senators, four of them senior Democrats, to intervene with regulators on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s behalf. The president thus far has praised <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> for his bipartisan conduct of the hearings and said he has `` not closed the door'' on ousting Wall. Aides to Wall speculate that <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> may be holding out the possibility of <PERSON> Silverado </PERSON> hearings as part of his bid to get rid of the regulator.

 It is n't any noisy, late-night parties at bachelor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumate </PERSON>'s home that have his neighbors whispering. It's what he keeps in his front yard. Like the life-size <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> bust with purple pompadour, bolted atop a tall pedestal guarded by a grinning, red-bearded gnome holding a sign reading `` Long Live the King.'' Or that plastic palm tree festooned with blinking blue lights that decorated <PERSON> Shumate </PERSON>'s front porch last Christmas, opposite a plastic <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> whose fat belly was illuminated with a flashing light bulb. Passersby also are transfixed by the concrete <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> and pink flamingo, the plastic madonna blessing the concrete rabbit, squirrel and penguin. And the little concrete toddler, shyly clutching a teddy bear and sucking on its fingers while its diapers fall down. It's one of <PERSON> Shumate </PERSON>'s favorites. `` It's the most horrifying thing I've ever seen,'' he says with a chuckle. `` It's just awful.'' <PERSON> Shumate </PERSON>, a 42-year-old architect and avid collector of lawn ornaments, delights in adorning the yard of his modest bungalow in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb with the sort of truly tasteless schlock that makes urban sophisticates wince. `` I saw this stuff when I was a kid growing up in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburbs,'' he said. `` It was humorous to me even then. What's interesting about the 50s was the junky stuff _ the cars, the lawn sculptures, the furniture. It's so bad it's good.'' <PERSON> Shumate </PERSON> had only a few pink flamingos when he bought his <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> house three years ago. Perhaps it was the house, with its original pink aluminum siding from the 1950s, that inspired <PERSON> Shumate </PERSON> to begin collecting in earnest. His favorite haunt is <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s Lawn Ornaments, a two-acre mecca for kitsch hunters in rural <LOCATION> Harrisonburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. It was there that he found his $ 32 <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> bust among the tons of concrete birdbaths, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> figures, antlered stags and naked ladies. `` Things were relatively quiet around here until I put up <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Shumate </PERSON> said. `` It became a landmark overnight. At first my neighbors did n't know what to think, but they finally figured out my sense of humor and now they enjoy it.'' <PERSON> Shumate </PERSON> is a Cadillac freak, too. He's owned six of them. The latest, parked in his driveway, is a monstrous 1975 model Fleetwood. Original avocado green paint, wide white sidewalls, license plates that read `` Gross XS'' -LRB- for Gross Excess -RRB- and a `` Caution: I Brake For Elvis'' bumper sticker. `` I consider that to be one of my lawn sculptures,'' he says. Down in his basement, <PERSON> Shumate </PERSON> keeps the trashy stuff he has n't decided where to display in the proper mock-serious style, including a concrete cherub with a large fish draped over its shoulder and `` your generic babe with a bunch of grapes'' sprayed with gilt paint On a shelf are air-brushed wall squirrels, a pink coffee mug with pelican-shaped handle, a blue plastic shark that <PERSON> Shumate </PERSON> once hung from the rear-view mirror of his old powder-blue Caddy. `` This is what yuppies put in their kitchen window as a joke,'' he said disdainfully. `` They have no real commitment to lawn ornaments. If everyone thinks it's a joke, it does n't count. It's not really fun.

<HEAD>Bush, Gorbachev Leave Summit Offering Visions of Cold War's End</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> left their weatherblown summit talks offering visions of a dawning era of lasting peace, with the remnants of the Cold War giving way to a better world. They announced no breakthroughs Sunday on issues that divide their countries, such as <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and naval disarmament, but said that was not the point of their open-agenda dockside encounters. In their parting remarks, both chose to emphasize mutual aspirations. `` We sought the answer to the question where we stand now,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters. `` Many things that were characteristic of the Cold War should be abandoned ... the arms race, mistrust, psychological and ideological struggle and all that. All that should be things of the past.'' Trading relaxed banter at the first-ever joint news conference of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidents, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> repeatedly echoed each other's words as they described their talks and their hopes for the future. `` I could n't have asked for a better result out of this non-summit summit,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It was a no-agenda meeting and yet it was a meeting where were discussed, as the chairman said, many, many subjects. So I think if a meeting can improve relations, I think this one has.'' The next chance comes in June, when a full-scale Bush-Gorbachev summit is scheduled for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The fireworks missing in the superpower talks were supplied Sunday night in a loud and colorful display over the <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION>, the capital of this Mediterranean island nation. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, meanwhile, headed for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to meet with his <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to brief the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. `` Tonight we stand at the crossroads of history on our way to a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> made whole and free,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said when he arrived in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. `` Today as the sun broke through the clouds there at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, we could see both a new world taking shape, a new world of freedom,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was `` encouraged and inspired'' by the reforms sweeping Stalin-style communism from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said the changes stem from `` the desire of these peoples to ennoble their societies, to make them more democratic, humanitarian, to open up the rest of the world.'' And in a post-summit interview broadcast on Soviet television, he had praise for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I must say I'm glad I found a lot of realism in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attitude and I felt his desire, his effort to understand the processes under way, exchange opinions, to work out approaches,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` The dialogue actually surpassed my expectations.'' The weather in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> was less congenial. What was planned as an offshore summit alternating between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet warships never came off. Saturday afternoon's session was canceled when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could not get off the guided-missile cruiser USS Belknap because of 60 mph winds and high seas. The two rounds of talks that did take place were both moved to the Soviet cruise liner Maxim Gorky, docked at <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> several hundred yards from the naval vessels. Neither leader ever made it to the missile cruiser <PERSON> Slava </PERSON>, intended to be the Soviet summit site. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested cutting naval forces on the two sides, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose large-ship navy predominates, said he was `` disinclined to think that this is an area where we will have immediate progress.'' The leaders also restated their positions on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained about Nicaraguan and Cuban supplies of Soviet-bloc weapons to rebels fighting the right-wing government in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had given assurances such shipments had stopped. `` I do n't believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have told the truth to our Soviet friends,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> could benefit from cuts in tariffs on Soviet exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support for its participation in the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in exchange for relaxing emigration restrictions on Soviet Jews. The leaders also ordered their officials to speed up negotiations on treaties to cut conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and long-range nuclear weapons in hopes of signing both next year. An unprecedented joint news conference at the conclusion of the summit was not part of the initial plans. It developed when both leaders stayed to respond to questions after making their statements, and unfolded in a relaxed, almost teasing atmosphere. While the two were discussing the possible reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had exchanged messages on the question. `` The president wrote in English and I do n't read English. I answered him in Russian and he does n't read Russian. But, we agreed,'' said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` No matter what it said,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sets out from his first superpower summit meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to lead his <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliance into a new era of cooperation with the West _ or risk being left behind and alone. As he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> parted after two days in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> headed home for a meeting with a dramatically different and more Westward-looking <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> leadership than when members last convened in July. The communist bloc alliance has become less communist and less a bloc, presenting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with the challenge of leading the transition he described from a Kremlin-dominated military alliance to a new political association guiding <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in its rush to erase the lines that have divided East and West for 45 years. Culturally and geographically, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> partners are closer to the West than the vast <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> straddling <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. And as they turn away from the Kremlin to face the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may find it increasingly difficult to drive his stubbornly backward society at a quick enough pace to catch up. At his joint news conference with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> closing their first summit meeting, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> declared himself `` encouraged and inspired'' by the changes that have swept hardline communists from power in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. The changes, he said, show `` the desire of these peoples to ennoble their societies, to make them more democratic and humanitarian and to open up to the rest of the world.'' But they also dramatically alter the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s once dominant and domineering role in the alliance. For the first time since the pact was signed in the Polish capital in 1955 in response to the formation of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, one of the leaders present _ Polish Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> _ will be a non-communist. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a leader of the independent Solidarity labor movement suppressed with Soviet support in 1981, was elected in August to head <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s first non-communist government in four decades. And on the eve of the summit, the leadership of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, at the heart of the strategic alliance, was wrenched by its second spasm in recent weeks as communist leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> and the party's entire top echelon abdicated to a 25-member panel of reformers in a desperate effort to salvage some measure of support for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> relinquished the party post he had held less than six weeks, and although he retained the largely ceremonial title of president, it was not immediately clear who would represent <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting. Several other East European leaders, including <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, are attending their first <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leadership meeting. And for the first time since the alliance was formed, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, now out of power, apparently was n't invited at all <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who continues to rule <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> with the iron hand once rewarded by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, is the only <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc leader who rejects the democratically inspired reform movement. With the recent fall of orthodox communist leaders like <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, he is likely to find himself more isolated than ever as he sits down with the new generation of East European leaders.

<HEAD>Summit Offers Cure for Country With Identity Crisis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Before the dockside summit, this tiny island nation suffered from an identity crisis. Maltese passports even included a map to show doubtful foreigners that the country exists. But that was before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> and put this rocky <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> archipelago back on everyone's map. The passports will be changed shortly after the first of the year, said a slightly embarrassed <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cachia </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruana </PERSON>, the aide to the prime minister who was in charge of organizing <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s part in the summit. `` That was a lack of self-confidence by the previous government,'' he said, shaking his head. `` It's degrading.'' Any lingering doubts by the Maltese about their country's identity seemed to have been dispelled by the superpower summit, by the words and images beamed abroad by about 2,500 journalists covering the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush-Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> talks `` For <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> itself, the summit has been very positive. It has shown <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> can cope even with the necessary organization for a summit like this,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> said in an interview after the summit closed Sunday. `` Some people were skeptical that <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> could do it. I think we proved ourselves,'' he added. Not even the fierce December gale that drove the summit at sea to the side of a pier could dampen the enthusiasm of the prime minister. `` Well, I do n't mind the weather at all. If anything, it has proved I was correct when I suggested that the meetings should not be held in <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> but in some other bay, such as <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, which is more protected than <PERSON> Marsaxlokk </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Cachia </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruana </PERSON> said the Soviets and Americans first planned to hold the summit at sea, perhaps in Maltese territorial waters, but that the prime minister had convinced them of the hazards of December. `` Within 24 hours we made the point that this is December and that these things can happen,'' he said. Still, he acknowledges the images of thunderous waves crashing against the rocks below the 16th Century fortifications of the capital <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION> wo n't help the island's winter tourism. `` In terms of what we had hoped to achieve overall, the tourism objectives probably will not be met,'' said <PERSON> Cachia </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruana </PERSON>. `` But our principal objective, especially in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was name identification. `` Just being at the center of the world stage for two days in a way helped give us that anyway.'' <PERSON> Cachia </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruana </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> wants to base its growth on business, not just tourism, and that's why the summit will help. `` Our greatest objective is dragging the economy into the last decade of the 20th Century,'' he said. Still, in those first few hours after the departure of the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the chief Maltese organizer of the summit was relieved that it was over. `` It's been a hell of an experience. We had a situation here where the journalists outnumbered the army by two-to-one,'' said <PERSON> Cachia </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruana </PERSON>. `` It's back to business as usual tomorrow. We will assume it was a dream and forget all about it.''

 Recent Japanese purchases in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> have made some people nervous, despite a foreign-buyer tradition that started when Dutch settlers snapped up the island for $ 24 worth of knives, fabric and trinkets. Officials say a majority of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s buildings still are owned by Americans, and Japanese are not even the largest foreign landlords. Some find the alarm over Japanese purchases puzzling. `` I do n't know what's behind this xenophobia,'' said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` Everyone seems to have been jolted awake to find we're not the only large economy in the world. Several organizations have tried to estimate foreign holdings in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> commercial real estate, but no one really knows the figure, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, head of the real estate firm that bears his name. `` When a foreigner buys a piece of property, he does n't declare, ` I'm a foreigner,''' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a researcher for the <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. `` The owner's name may be <ORGANIZATION> Piccadilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION>, but there's no legislation requiring them to sign in as British.'' Foreign investments often are made through part ownerships, joint ventures and convertible mortgages, which can further cloud an owner's identity. `` On a mortgage the address might simply say, ` Return to <LOCATION> Curacao </LOCATION>''' said Ms. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. When <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced in October it was spending $ 846 million for a controlling interest in the company that owns <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, local wits said sumo wrestlers would soon take over the center's ice skating rink. On a more gloomy note, Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., said of the Christmas tree-lighting ceremony at the center in <LOCATION> midtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, `` that great national celebration is actually occurring on Japanese property. But, noted Ms. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, `` the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and the Dutch have been buying in this country for a long, long time,'' and it seems safe to say that worries about foreigners buying up <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> are exaggerated. `` For all the publicity, the amount of foreign-owned real estate here is still pretty modest,'' said <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON>. `` It's not such a big deal.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, during the past 15 years foreigners have acquired about 64 million of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s 335 million square feet of prime office space, or 19 percent. This includes Canadians -LRB- 7.3 percent -RRB-, Japanese -LRB- 5.4 percent -RRB-, British -LRB- 2.7 percent -RRB- and Dutch -LRB- 1.4 percent -RRB-. Other foreigners have bought more than 2 percent. The city's largest single foreign landowner is <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, which shrewdly began buying in the depressed market of the mid-1970s and now owns about 25 million square feet of office space worth billion of dollars. Since 1986, Japanese investors have jumped into commercial real estate, snapping up the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Paine </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> buildings. They also bought hotels, including the Algonquin, the Stanhope, the Inter-Continental and the <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. But they have been even more active elsewhere. In 1988, when Japanese investors bought $ 8.3 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate, twice as much of that was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. More than half the office buildings in downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> are foreign owned, according to the real estate firm of <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Wakefield </LOCATION>. Even in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a city that was never a magnet for foreign investment, 12 percent of the office space is owned by foreigners, and some experts say that could rise to 50 percent by the year 2000. Foreign investment in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office space will surely increase _ Swedes and <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> are said to be next in line for some prime buildings _ but business executives, at least, are n't worried. In a survey released earlier this year, 55 percent of corporate executives said foreign investment helped the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, and 31 percent said it was little cause for alarm. Only 10 percent of real estate executives said foreign investment severely threatened the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. In fact, foreign investment is crucial to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON>, noting that foreign money helped the city rebound from its fiscal crisis a decade ago. `` It's important for the city's economy that investment come in,'' she said. `` It's not so important where it comes from.''

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statement Sunday at the conclusion of his two-day summit meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: There are many symbolic things about this meeting and one of them _ it has never been in history that the leaders of our two countries hold a joint press conference. This is also an important symbol. I share the view voiced by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that we are satisfied in general with the results of the meeting. We regard this informal meeting _ the idea of it was an informal meeting and the idea belongs to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and I supported it _ that we would have this informal meeting without restricting it to any formal agenda, to have a free exchange of views, because the time makes great demands to our countries, and this increases the responsibility and the role of our two countries. And I can assure you that in all our discussions _ and our discussions lasted for eight hours, in general _ this responsibility on both sides was present. Our meeting was characterized by openness, by a full scope of the exchange of views. Today, it is even difficult and perhaps there is no sense to explain the entire range of issues that we have discussed. I wish to say right away, nevertheless, that on all the major issues, we attempted in a frank manner, using each side's arguments, to explain our own positions, both with regard to the assessment of the situation and the current changes in the world, in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and as regards disarmament issues We addressed the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiating process, the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> process, and also negotiations on the elaboration of the chemical weapons ban. All those questions were considered thoroughly. The president and I, myself, also thought it necessary to exchange views on our perception, both from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, of the `` hot'' places on our planet. And this exchange of views was very significant and thorough. We reaffirmed our former positions that all those issues, acute issues, must be resolved by political methods. And I consider that this was a very important statement of fact. We not only discussed problems and explained our positions, I think that both sides had many elements which, if they are taken into account in our future activities, activities of both governments, then we can count on progress. This concerns the subject of the reduction of strategic offensive arms by 50 percent. And we have an optimistic assessment of the possibility to move even next year to the conclusion of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> treaty. We both are in favor _ and this is our position. Naturally, we can be responsible only for our position. We are in favor of signing this document at the summit meeting. This time we discussed much bilateral relations. And I, on my part, would like to note many positive elements and points which were contained in statements and words by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Thus, I would say that in all directions of the political dialogue of our discussion, including bilateral relations, we not only confirmed the consistency of our political course, the continuity of our political course _ and I should say, although we had an informal meeting, we met only for the first time with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his capacity, and the confirmation of the continuity of the course is an important element. What is also important is that during this informal meeting, we have laid the foundation for increasing this. And I believe that in the first place, it serves the interest of our both countries and also the interests of the entire world community. Well, we have made our contact a good contact. The atmosphere was friendly, straightforward, open. And this enabled us to make good work. In our position, the most dangerous thing is to exaggerate _ and that is always that we should preserve elements of cautiousness _ and I use the favorite word by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Our world and our relations are at a crucial juncture. We should be highly responsible to face up to the challenges of today's world And the leaders of our two countries can not act as a fire brigade, although fire brigades are very useful. We have to keep it in mind also. This element was also present. I would like once again to thank the president for the idea of holding this meeting with which we are satisfied, I hope. And I would like to thank the people and the government of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, and to express the words of appreciation and gratitude for their hospitality. Thank you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, for your cooperation.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement at the conclusion of his two-day summit meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>: Ladies and gentlemen, President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has graciously suggested I go first. And I do n't think anyone can say that the saltwater get-together was anything other than adventure, at least out in the harbor here. First, I want to thank Prime Minister -LRB- <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> and the people of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> and others for their warm and gracious hospitality. I want to thank the captain and crew of -LRB- the USS -RRB- <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> for the great support that they've given us _ I think they were wondering if I was about to become a permanent guest _ and a special thanks to the captain and crew of -LRB- the Soviet cruise ship Maxim -RRB- <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> for their hospitality, and also thanks to the captain and crew of -LRB- the Soviet naval cruiser -RRB- <PERSON> Slava </PERSON> who had been so hospitable to many on the American side. I first approached Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about an informal meeting of this kind after my trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> last July. The amazing changes that I witnessed in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, hopeful changes, led me to believe that it was time to sit down with Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, face to face, to see what he and I could do to seize the opportunities before us to move this relationship forward. He agreed with that concept of a meeting, and so we got rapid agreement. And I think that the extraordinary ... developments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since the time that the meeting was proposed only reinforced the importance of our getting together. So I'm especially glad we had this meeting, and we did gain a deeper understanding of each other's views. We set the stage for progress across a broad range of issues. And while it is not for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to design the future for Europeans or for any other people, I am convinced that a cooperative U.S.-Soviet relationship can indeed make the future safer and brighter. And there is virtually no problem in the world, and certainly no problem in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, that improvement in the U.S.-Soviet relationship will not help to ameliorate. A better U.S.-Soviet relationship is to be valued in and of itself, but it also should be an instrument of positive change for the world. For 40 years the Western alliances stood together in the cause of freedom. And now, with reform under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, we stand at the threshold of a brand-new era of U.S.-Soviet relations. And it is within our grasp to contribute, each in our own way, to overcoming the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and ending the military confrontation there. We've got to do more to ameliorate the violence and suffering that afflict so many regions in the world and to remove common threats to our future. The deterioration of the environment, the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons, ballistic missile technology, the narcotics trade, and our discussions here will give greater impetus to make real progress in these areas. There's also a great potential to develop common opportunities. For example, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> now seeks greater engagement with the international market economy, a step that certainly I'm prepared to encourage in every way I can As I leave <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> and a meeting with our <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, I am optimistic that, as the West works patiently together and increasingly cooperates with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, we can realize a lasting peace and transform the East-West relationship to one of enduring cooperation. And that is a future that is worthy of our peoples, and that's the future that I want to help in creating, and that's the future that Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I began right here in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. -LRB- To <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- Thank you, sir, for your hospitality.

<HEAD>Aquaculture a Growing US Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Catfish farming has had some flip-flops over the years but <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> experts say it looks good over the long pull. For that matter, fish farming in general _ aquaculture is the fancy name _ is expanding and shows promise if growers and processors can hone their marketing skills. Catfish are the main items in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aquaculture output, but trout, salmon, crawfish and other species are also growing, according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But there are problems. For example, catfish farmers have boosted production so rapidly that sometimes the demand lags supplies. In October, for example, production was estimated at 31.7 million pounds, live weight. That was up 21 percent from 26.2 million pounds a year earlier. Prices received by growers averaged 64 cents per pound, down 19 percent from 79 cents in October 1988. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said aquaculture in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still `` a young and growing industry'' that is still going through adjustments that may become even more important in the 1990s. A number of forces will contribute to the continued growth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aquaculture, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> told last week's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> outlook conference. `` First, the interaction of worldwide population growth and the biological limits of what our oceans can supply should increase the demand for farm-raised fish,'' he said. `` As the capture-fisheries industry approaches maximum harvest rates for more and more species, added pressure will be placed on aquaculture to become a major source of seafood production.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said one sign of the pressure on commercial fishing _ the `` capture'' fisheries _ is the growing number of harvesting restrictions being placed on species around the world. Another factor is the growing public concern about pollution of ocean and fresh water resources. This `` should strengthen aquaculture's position as an alternate source of seafood'' produced under closely watched conditions, he said. `` However, aquaculturists must make the public aware of how their products differ from those of the capture-fisheries industry,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. `` To avoid consumer resistance to their products due to pollution concerns, producers must maintain high quality standards, be sensitive to consumer fears about contaminated products, and be able to document the safety of their products.'' The ongoing emphasis on nutrition also should help boost seafood consumption, he said. Other factors that may influence <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seafood consumption include the general aging of Americans and the rising percentage of non-whites. `` Both these groups, older people and non-whites, in the past have consumed seafood at higher rates than the general population,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. `` One -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- study combining changes in age, race and income estimated that seafood expenditures for fish products would increase 27.4 percent between 1980 and 2005, well above the projected increases for beef, pork or poultry.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said if legislation is passed to require federal inspection of seafood products it would boost consumer confidence in the safety of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seafood but would probably add some expense to processing and marketing. `` The basic technologies are now in place for the expansion of the domestic aquaculture industry, but producers will have to successfully deal with a variety of issues that may impact future growth,'' he said. `` The rate of growth for most aquacultural species may depend on the industry's success at marketing its products to a larger group of consumers.''

<HEAD>Wind Damage to Cropland Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soil erosion from water runoff declined between 1982 and 1987, but wind damage to the nation's cropland increased slightly, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said today. The latest National Resources Inventory released by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said `` sheet and rill'' erosion by water dropped to an average of 3.8 tons per acre annually from 4.3 tons during the five-year period. Wind erosion, however, increased 0.1 ton per acre to 3.3 tons per acre annually. Most wind erosion of cropland is concentrated in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states. Total sheet-and-rill erosion of cropland was reported at 1.6 billion tons per year and wind erosion at nearly 1.4 billion tons annually. The national summary of the <ORGANIZATION> NRI </ORGANIZATION> _ a benchmark reference used widely by government and private conservationists and others _ will be followed next year by a complete report, officials said. Wilson Scaling, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the report includes information on erosion, cropland use, irrigation, tillage and conservation needs. The area of rural non-federal land totals 1.4 billion acres, the report said. Of this, 422.8 million acres are cropland; 401.7 million rangeland; 394.5 million forestland; and 59.9 million in `` minor land uses.'' From 1982 to 1987, it said, 4 million acres of rural non-federal land were converted to urban and transportation uses, which include roads and airports. Cropland increased 1.4 million acres in the five years to 422.8 million from 421.4 million, while pastureland declined 2.3 million acres and rangeland dropped 6 million acres.

 Weary network crews trudged home today after following their anchormen from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, where they covered a summit whose storms threatened to upstage the superpowers. At one point Saturday night, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> warned that `` if the weather does n't improve, this thing's going to be a wreck.'' But from the TV standpoint, the only thing wrecked at the summit was a small studio <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> had built near <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, overlooking the harbor site of the shipboard meetings of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the structure was demolished by Saturday's storm, which forced the cancellation of the day's second planned meeting of the two leaders and sent network staffs scurrying to reshape their coverage <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> had to remain with the other anchors in the city of <LOCATION> Valetta </LOCATION>, six miles away. But that was only one of <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s problems Saturday's 60 mph winds blew down and damaged a <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> satellite dish, knocking out <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s signal for eight hours. But a spokesman said no transmissions had been planned during the period of the blackout, which began at 9 p.m. EST. The storm also briefly affected <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Rain shorted out an electrical connection at the start of anchor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenning </PERSON>'s live summit report from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> during the first of two `` World News Tonight'' broadcasts that <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> sends its affiliates each night. But the Maltese connection was quickly restored. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> came back on with his report eight minutes later. The storm did n't much affect <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> coverage of Saturday's summit, to which the four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> networks brought a total of nearly 200 staff members On Sunday, the weather was much better. But an electronic problem caused a translation problem for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> during the live telecast of the superpower leaders' joint news conference aboard the safely docked Soviet luxury liner Maxim Gorky. The Soviets provided the TV pool feed for broadcasters and an audio channel offering a simultaneous English translations of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks. However, during the last half hour of the session, an electronic glitch knocked out the English-language channel. CBS and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had translators standing by, so viewers did n't miss anything. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> hastily summoned a Soviet official on <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, but missed eight minutes of translation. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> went the long way for help. After 13 minutes in which <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> recapped summit news while <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was speaking, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman's voice was heard translating the Soviet leader's comments. She was <PERSON> Siobahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>, translating from <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. The summit capped a busy week for the networks, during which their anchors were based in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, and in the case of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

He says the Nancy he knew _ lover of laughter and life _ would rather die than linger in her persistent vegetative state, incapable of interacting with her environment and possessing no thoughts, no emotions. `` I do n't think this is a decision for every family, but it is the right decision for us because we feel that is what <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> would want,'' said the 55-year-old sheet metal worker. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>, 32, a former employee of a cheese factory, has been in this condition since a 1983 car wreck, kept alive with a feeding tube surgically implanted in her stomach. She stays, at taxpayer expense, at the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a state institution in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, her parents will be in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, listening again to the legal questions father shares with daughter in the quiet of her hospital room. `` I've told her what the legal process is,'' <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> said. `` I've said, ` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, I know this is scary,' because I think everyone to a certain extent fears death It's an unknown thing.'' The case marks the first time the court has considered when it is appropriate to stop medical treatment _ to pull the plug on a life. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, acting as <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s court-appointed guardians, want to remove her feeding tube. A <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> judge ruled they could, but the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned that ruling in November 1988. Missouri law allows people under certain circumstances to refuse medical treatment but not food and water. Among the issues in the <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> case is whether family members can make such a refusal on behalf of an incompetent relative, and whether food and water provided through a surgically implanted tube constitutes medical treatment. The parents say they should have the final word about whether their daughter lives or dies. They also say the state has no right to force unwanted treatment on <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, and that she has not lost her constitutional rights _ including the right to privacy _ because of her condition. Missouri Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> counters that the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was correct in saying the parents can not terminate the use of the feeding tube. `` It's a question of whether the court will articulate a new constitutional right for the family,'' he said. `` We do n't think the remedy the family is seeking is found in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Constitution.'' The most famous right-to-die case was never taken up by the nation's high court. In 1976, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> had a right to take their comatose daughter, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, off a respirator, and the federal justices declined to review the decision. Ms. <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON>'s respirator was removed, but she continued to be fed through a tube. She lingered nine years before dying in 1985 at age 31. As the <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> case goes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> lies in a bed, her body stiff and her hands so bent they resemble claws, the fingernails digging into her wrists if they go untrimmed. Doctors say <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> could live 40 more years if she is given food and water. <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON> says <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> would n't like that prospect. He hopes the justices will agree. `` I feel like if they make a common sense judgment, they will rule in our favor,'' he said from his home in <LOCATION> Carterville </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. `` I do feel optimistic.'' `` It's something that has to be done, something to achieve the goal we have set out to achieve,'' he said. The Cruzans' attorney, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, also expects to prevail. `` This is hopefully the end of a long, long road. But the family has been willing to travel that road because they are doing what they know, as only a family can know, that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> would want. It has been an agonizing ordeal.''

<HEAD>Federal Prisons Bulging as Inmate Population Doubles in Decade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal prison system is 56 percent over capacity, with more than twice as many inmates as in 1980 when the system was less than 1 percent above capacity, a congressional report says. Federal prisons contained 24,162 inmates in 1980, but the number mushroomed to 48,017 by 1989, said the report Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm. The 70 institutions operated by the federal system were designed to hold a maximum of 30,860 prisoners. The report was requested by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga. Even under a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> plan to increase capacity by 109 percent to 64,400 inmates within the next five years, the system is still projected to be operating at 30 percent over capacity, the report said. And authorities are projecting an inmate population of up to 147,000 in the federal system within a dozen years, the report said. It also contained these other findings: _ Just 19 percent of prisoners counted in May 1989 were serving time for violent offenses _ The price tag for expanding the prison system is $ 51,340 a bed _ Forty percent of inmates entering the system had a moderate or serious substance abuse problem _ Acquired immune deficiency syndrome -LRB- AIDS -RRB- represents a potentially serious and costly problem for the prison system The report also said state prison systems are operating at 23 percent over capacity with a total of 577,000 inmates. It said that as of April, 35 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> were operating under court orders or consent decrees related to crowding. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> select committee on narcotics, said in a statement that until `` we get at the root causes of drug abuse _ homelessness, joblessness, lack of education, lack of health care and above all poverty _ we are likely to see continued record overcrowding no matter how many prisons we build.'' He said it is clear that most criminals are not being rehabilitated by prison but instead are back behind bars within three to five years. `` That is a very expensive process,'' he said. `` I recognize that it may not be politically popular, but we have to provide alternative programs for nonviolent offenders with education, rehabilitation, job training and drug treatment to generate better citizens instead of more hardened criminals,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said key reasons for the mushrooming prison population are mandatory sentencing and stricter parole practices. `` Because prison overcrowding is often a key factor in increased prison violence and disciplinary problems, we must have a better handle on how to deal with the growing number of people entering the prison systems,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Seven Referendums on North Dakota Ballot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> take a tradition of political orneriness to the polls Tuesday in a special election that will decide seven referendums, including higher taxes, gambling and sex education. The debate has focused on whether to sustain the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to raise taxes on income, sales and gasoline, a move opponents contend will drive people and businesses out of a state already in an economic slump It also has pitted gambling opponents against the attorney general, and the state health department against a parents' group troubled by proposed mandatory health instruction in the public schools. `` It's certainly been a difficult campaign,'' said Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON>, who has held dozens of public forums urging voters to uphold the tax increases. Over the years, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> voters have used referendums to block construction of a state office building, reverse a college name change and sustain a ban on municipal parking meters. However, they have n't had to vote on so many referendums at one time since June 1919, when voters approved seven bills, said Secretary of State <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusler </PERSON>. One established the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION>, which remains the nation's only state-owned bank. Sinner, a Democrat, won his second term last year with 60 percent of the vote against a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate who pledged not to raise taxes. This fall, he threw himself into the lead role of campaigning for the tax bills that would raise the sales tax from 5 percent to 6 percent; the gasoline tax from 17 cents to 20 cents a gallon; and the income tax from 14 percent to 17 percent of a taxpayer's federal tax bill `` If I do n't keep this state with a good future, I'm going to consider my job and my work as a failure. Nothing else seems to me to be any more important than that, and politics be damned,'' Sinner told reporters. The governor has used the specter of increased property taxes and drastic cuts in education and social services if voters reject the tax measures. Last week in <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, he appeared on stage with two men in wheelchairs, who spoke about their fears of cuts in state human-services spending. Kent French, a <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> businessman who has led the fight against the tax increases, says the governor is exaggerating their possible impact. `` It's time for state government to make spending choices, the same way families have had to do,'' French said. `` Their choice has been to raise taxes, and that's got to stop.'' In addition to the three separate referendums on taxes, voters must decide whether to approve the sex education issue, a mandatory seat-belt law, a retirement program for legislators and legalization of video gambling machines. They also were considering a proposed constitutional amendment to reorganize state government. Attorney General <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> is advocating the gambling machines as an honest alternative to pull tabs _ pull-apart paper tickets that players draw at random from a jar in hopes of picking one carrying a cash prize. But introduction of the machines is being fought by opponents of state-sanctioned gambling, including former Gov. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON>, and pull tab manufacturers who fear the machines will cut into their market. `` It certainly has n't been a political success for me to endorse the concept of electronic gaming. But I think it's the right thing for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> said last week. Debate over the health curriculum has centered on whether information about AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases belongs in public schools. The law under challenge in the referendum would mandate health education in every school, including information about sexually transmitted diseases. It leaves decisions on details largely to individual districts. An opponent, <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergstedt </PERSON>, a registered nurse from the western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> community of <PERSON> Hazen </PERSON>, contends the teaching of sexual abstinence should take precedence over instruction on the use of contraceptives as a way of preventing disease. `` The opponents are looking for bogymen under every stone,'' countered Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON>, an official of the state health department. He said the education program will emphasize abstinence. Polls indicate voters are leaning in favor of the seat belt and health education laws but against electronic gambling and the legislative retirement program. The polls initially showed overwhelming opposition to the tax increases, but they have shifted in favor of tax advocates as the election nears, and both sides predict a close result. `` It's going to go right down to the wire,'' French said. `` I just pray to God it does n't snow on December Fifth.''

<HEAD>Report Cites Serious Lapse in Security at Nuclear Weapons Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Serious security lapses involving large amounts of plutonium were noted in an inspection earlier this year of a federal nuclear weapons laboratory in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a congressional report says. The report released Sunday also said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from 1982 through 1988 misled the president, in its annual reports to the White House, about the adequacy of measures to protect weapons-grade nuclear materials from potential theft or sabotage. The report included a declassified transcript of a closed hearing last July in which several senior <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials testified on security and safeguards weaknesses in the nuclear weapons production and design complex. The hearing was held by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations. The panel is investigating the department's nuclear weapons facilities, which have been wracked by allegations of health, safety and environmental violations. Some key plants have been closed temporarily. According to the hearing transcript, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s weapons security evaluations office, was highly critical of nuclear materials protection at <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The Livermore lab has come under fire in recent years for illegal drug use by some employees, alleged ethics and conflict-of-interest violations by senior lab officials and charges of theft of government property from the facility. The lab is run for the government by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. One passage from the McCallum report said security systems at a <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION> building in which weapons-grade plutonium is handled `` do not provide assurance'' that the highly radioactive material is `` adequately protected from theft or sabotage.'' Also, it said the security system was unreliable in detecting contraband at entry gates and intruders at specially protected areas with access to nuclear materials. Under questioning from Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> said these security lapses involved quantities of plutonium greater than 4.5 pounds, which is enough to build a nuclear bomb Another part of <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>'s report said the lab sometimes allowed `` category one'' quantities of plutonium to be left unattended in rooms without security alarms. <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> told <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> this was a serious breach of security. <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>'s report was based on an inspection last April and May of <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> and the department's regional office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> which oversees the lab's operations. Among other disclosures in the subcommittee report: _ Among all the 26 weapons facilities and regional offices inspected for security and weapons materials protection safeguards by <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>'s office over the past year, <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> ranked the lowest _ The <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, regional offices used private contractors in some cases to screen and interview weapons plant employees seeking security clearances These contractors did not actually grant any clearances, but their role nonetheless was contrary to department policy, officials said. _ The department acknowledged that it lacks the resources to complete investigations of suspected security violations by some weapons employees who currently have access to classified material This violates the department's own policy, <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> wrote in his report, `` and does not provide assurance that only eligible individuals are granted continued access to security interests.'' The hearing also disclosed that the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> regional office had chosen not to include the plutonium-handling building in its own most recent inspections of <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, acting manager of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> office, told the panel that because of this omission, he was not aware of the plutonium safeguards problems at the time of the McCallum inspection. In a later written response to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> called the omission `` a serious oversight. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> office had changed its inspection methods to include `` an intensive annual survey'' of all lab facilities. In the subcommittee report released Sunday, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said annual reports to the president from the energy secretary had offered `` a misleading account'' of the level of protection being afforded special nuclear materials and nuclear facilities.

<HEAD>Decreased Driving Pushing Down Price of Gasoline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A gallon of gasoline cost about a half-cent less at the nation's pumps during the past two weeks due to the traditional fall-winter decrease in driving, according to an industry analyst. The average service-station price of gasoline, including taxes, was $ 1.0697 per gallon as of Dec. 1, according to a <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON>'s biweekly survey of 13,000 stations. The previous retail average was $ 1.0751 per gallon. `` This continues a downward price trend that has prevailed ever since late May except for two very small upward price moves,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said Sunday. She said the decline can be attributed to decreased driving that normally occurs at this time of year. Prices were cut to spur sales. Prices per gallon at self-service pumps as of Dec. 1 were: 95.10 cents for regular unleaded, $ 1.1271 for premium unleaded and 96.46 cents for regular leaded. At full-service stations average prices were: $ 1.2594 for regular unleaded, $ 1.3887 for premium unleaded and $ 1.2334 for regular leaded.

 <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who was freed from prison after his case was documented in the movie `` The Thin Blue Line,'' said it felt strange to return to the city where he was convicted of killing a policeman. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' first return to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> since his release from state prison last March was because of a benefit dinner for an organization that investigates the cases of people who may have been wrongly convicted. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who now in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, spent 12 years behind bars for the 1976 shooting death of the policeman. `` Being back here is a little strange.

 <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> always planned to use her legal training to help the disabled. But the deaf <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law student found she also needed her skills to help herself. Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, a 39-year-old third-year law student who represented herself in a court hearing, won a court order forcing the university to supply her with class notes. Her victory was one of two last week that upheld rights of the disabled. A federal judge ruled that a school district in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, must supply a sign-language interpreter for deaf parents at school-sponsored parents conferences. Both lawsuits were filed under the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which says any organization receiving federal aid can not discriminate against the handicapped. `` We have two examples of recipients of federal financial assistance ... which refused to provide services of meaningful access to the programs,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Charmatz </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, which brought the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> case. `` In both cases, the court recognized that the deaf parents or the deaf student were denied meaningful access.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> case is the first of its kind in the country, according to <PERSON> Charmatz </PERSON>. Coupled with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> case, it provides leverage to force school districts to comply with the federal guidelines, he said. `` This is an illustration of what school districts must do,'' <PERSON> Charmatz </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said her case marks the first time federal civil rights provisions have been used to force a university to supply assistance for a deaf student. When she began taking classes at the <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> campus in 1986, she said the university agreed to provide note-takers and interpreters for every course. Since then, Ms. Prince has filed two civil rights claims contending the university failed to live up to its promise. In one instance, she rejected notes she said were illegible. In the latest battle, a judge ordered the school provide note-takers and issued a temporary restraining order barring <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> from holding two classes unless Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> received transcribed notes within 24 hours of each class. <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackburn </PERSON>, associate dean of student affairs, said the university late last week hired a court stenographer to take notes for four one-hour lecture sessions. The service costs about $ 1,400, she said. The university has spent about $ 10,000 a year to provide sign-language translators and note-takers for Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, school officials said. School spokesmen have said they have had trouble finding qualified candidates. The law requires `` that one exert reasonable efforts and I believe I did above and beyond that,'' <ORGANIZATION> Blackburn </ORGANIZATION> said. Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, the only deaf student attending the 700-student law school, expects to graduate this semester, which ends Dec. 22. `` My first year I almost quit three times,'' she recalled in an interview done with an interpreter and through Ms. Prince's lip-reading ability `` It was so horrible. I just stuck it out.'' Her determination earned her classmates' admiration. `` I have a great amount of respect for the fact that she's come to law school and overcome her handicap. That's kind of impressive,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Gigliotti </PERSON>, 24, a third-year student from <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> began losing her hearing during her last two years of undergraduate study at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>, and became deaf in 1972. She learned sign language at <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and later worked as a legal secretary and researcher. A strong interest in political science and tougher legislation to help the disabled spurred her interest in law school. Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said she is considering setting up practices in several legal areas _ public interest, civil rights or contract law. `` I have a very strong interest in education and education of the handicapped,'' she said. `` That comes from what I've seen in how hard it is to get an education.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s top executive said he made mistakes in approving two money-losing internal financial deals, but denied that the resulting controversy spurred him to retire. `` I accept responsibility for the errors and the changes that are needed to prevent their recurrence,'' <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> Executive Vice President Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> told the opening ceremony of the group's mid-year meeting. <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Ring, chairman of the board of trustees, said in speeches to the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON>' plans to retire at the end of his current contract were known months ago. The 425 delegates are meeting through Wednesday to set <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> policy on numerous national health-care issues, but the internal financial controversy has captured much of their attention. The Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest organization for doctors, with nearly 300,000 members. The controversy centers on revelations this fall that <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> approved a $ 353,000 reimbursement to a former <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> executive for losses in a 1987 high-risk stock market fund, and a 1985 loan to another <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> executive to buy a high-price condominium during the latter's divorce. The executive involved in the stock-market loss has promised to pay back the money with interest. The recipient of the 1985 loan later defaulted, costing the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> $ 50,000 to foreclose. Ring told the delegates an investigation is continuing and a full report will be made to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>. He said the board would take steps so that `` this will not happen again.'' The board on Saturday issued a report saying <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> acted within his authority in the two deals, but `` failed to follow the usual fiscal policies and procedures.'' <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> said trustees declined to elaborate. The board also said it had accepted <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON>' plan to retire, effective March 31, 1991. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> said it was unclear why the board had included the retirement plans in the report on the deals. <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON>, who is widely respected for rescuing the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> from financial disaster when he took the job in 1974, plans to give up day-to-day management of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> at the end of next year. The board report also proposed a restructuring of its committees and hiring of an outside accounting firm. It said the board would set tighter fiscal limits on the authority of the executive vice president, but did not elaborate. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> also will consider a resolution passed last month by the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> urging <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> be placed on administrative leave until the investigation is completed. On Sunday, Secretary of Education <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> asked the physicians for help in improving and restructuring the nation's education system He asked the physicians to help raise public awareness of the nation's educational shortcomings. During the meetings, the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> delegates also will consider reports and resolutions that would: _ Acknowledge a patient's right to basic and essential health care; _ Establish policies regarding `` maternal-fetal conflict,'' such as when an expectant mother refuses medical treatment that would benefit her fetus; _ Encourage health-insurance companies to develop reduced-cost coverage for non-smokers; _ Urge a lowering of the blood-alcohol level to 0.05 percent for determination of drunken driving;. _ Work toward listing tobacco as a contributing factor on death certificates.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s fledgling opposition movement is splintered into at least five groups and lacks the kind of charismatic leader found in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Despite often diverging goals, everyone agrees on the need to strip the Communists of their 40-year grip on absolute power and to hold the nation's first free elections _ even the Communists. `` The Communists and their allies keep stealing and adopting our positions, to make themselves seem like a new and more trustworthy force,'' complains Lutheran Pastor <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppelmann </PERSON>, an opposition leader. Unlike its Communist neighbors, the East German opposition has no major figure like <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> or <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and no patron like the Roman Catholic or Protestant churches. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s best-known opposition figure is New Forum's <PERSON> Baerbel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohley </PERSON>, a 44-year-old <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> artist and painter And while Solidarity had years of struggle that also let the Polish opposition fine-tune its platform, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy forces suddenly have been thrown into the breach The groups have been operating completely in the open for only two months _ and free elections could be held as early as autumn. Opposition leaders are scheduled to meet the Communists on Dec. 7 to discuss the nation's future. The activists have made a series of sometimes divergent demands. They range from a better environment to a free choice on unity for the two Germanys. Some disagree on unification and on whether to make the state-controlled economy more market-oriented. New Forum is the largest group, with about 200,000 members and made up in large part of young street protesters. Other groups include the 150-member Greens party, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Democracy Now and <PERSON> Eppelmann </PERSON>'s Demokratische Aufbruch, which means democratic `` start'' or `` awakening.'' <PERSON> Eppelmann </PERSON>, a genial Lutheran cleric in jeans and running shoes, said the country's only hope lies in a multi-party system embracing the Communists, their allies and the new opposition parties. `` The established ones ca n't go it alone, and the new groups ca n't do it alone,'' he said. `` There will have to be a grand coalition of internal reason.'' Just where that coalition would head remains unclear, and even <PERSON> Eppelmann </PERSON> acknowledges it's difficult to say if there is room for all the envisioned participants in the new government. `` There has to be a pluralistic spectrum of organizations, where we can then develop a majority,'' said local New Forum leader <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehlmann </PERSON> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Pankow </PERSON> district. `` And there can only be majorities when there is diversity first.'' But <PERSON> Poehlmann </PERSON> acknowledged: `` The time for just asking questions is behind us. There is growing support for running candidates.'' Right now, it is uncertain whether the opposition will run as one group or as scattered forces against the Communists. `` Replacing the Communists with another bloc that lays claim to power and perhaps to truth in a monolithic way is not our goal,'' <PERSON> Poehlmann </PERSON> said during a weekend meeting. In one sense, New Forum, despite massive publicity and support, is having growing pains in changing from a market place for ideas to a true political force. `` The basic idea of New Forum was to think about what we can do in this country, where can it go? Do we want to be like the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, a consumer society?'' said New Forum co-founder <PERSON> Luise </PERSON> <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON>. `` That process continues. In eight weeks, you ca n't reach conclusions.'' New Forum's leaders want to keep some components of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s socialist structure, while warning that growing talk of reunification threatens to derail the reform process in the country of 16.5 million people. A public opinion poll published by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Stern magazine said if elections were held now, New Forum would be the winner with 22 percent of the vote. The Communists would be in third place behind the Communist-allied <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. Mounting an election campaign in a Western sense would be amost impossible in a country where essentials like typewriters and photocopying machines are in short supply _ and where the national telephone system seems on the verge of collapse. The opposition also is likely to find itself being courted _ and perhaps partially co-opted _ by the Communists themselves. <PERSON> Ingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a member of New Forum and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is suffering from a `` lack of new concepts'' that brought the opposition into being in the first place. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> estimated that 10 percent of New Forum's members belong to the 2-million strong <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, adding he looks forward to `` a government of all the important forces that unite this country. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a 39-year-old university economist, insists there will be no contradication in his dual membership even when New Forum runs candidates against the Communists. `` I would n't be the servant of two masters,'' he said with a smile, saying he can still support both groups.

<HEAD>Bikers Deliver Toys to L.A. Skid Row Mission</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 400 motorcyclists, from yuppie weekenders in exotic leather to hard-core bikers in soiled denim `` colors,'' delivered toys to a Skid Row mission in a thundering testament to good will. The walls of the Fred Jordan Mission echoed from the blast of arriving and departing Harley-Davidsons, Hondas, <LOCATION> Kawasakis </LOCATION> and other big road bikes as the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Harley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- HOG -RRB- and other motorcycle clubs made their second annual delivery for the mission. Some Skid Row residents looked astounded at the polished machines, some of them festooned with Christmas garlands and mounted by riders wearing red and fur-trimmed <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> hats. Others took the opportunity to collect empty aluminum soda cans left by the riders. `` I think it's the neatest thing there is,'' said <PERSON> Ferdie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaddick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Resplendent in black leather pants and jacket, <PERSON> Chaddick </PERSON> watched and laughed as Skid Row children and mission workers sat astride his $ 16,000 <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> for a snapshot. It belied, he admitted, the old biker motto that nobody _ NOBODY, touches a man's machine. `` The thing with the mission run is, we just go along with everything,'' said <PERSON> Chaddick </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> glazier. The delivery to the <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday was part of a larger effort in which the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said it expected 25,000 motorcyclists to drop off toys in the Dodger Stadium parking lot for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 Toy Run. `` We enjoy it, and its great for these needy kids,'' said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Fottler </PERSON>, who made the run to the mission with his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. `` A lot of people think we're hellions, but we're trying to drag down that old image,'' <PERSON> Fottler </PERSON> said. `` We have doctors, lawyers, policemen, firemen. We're just a band of bikers.'' The mission hopes to collect 40,000 new toys for its huge annual Christmas party on Dec. 16. About 20,000 people are expected this year, said <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, widow of mission founder <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. `` Last year, we expected 15,000, and we got 20,000,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. The mission ran out of toys and food bags, and about 3,000 people went away empty-handed. `` It was one of the saddest days in my life. I just wanted the street to swallow me up,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Federal officials located the wreck of a fishing boat that sank in the main channel entrance to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, killing two people, and warned other boats to avoid the spot. The 110-foot Bronx Queen sank Saturday afternoon with 19 people aboard. All were pulled from the water, but two men in their 50s who were among the passengers on the chartered fishing trip died later of hypothermia. Three people remained hospitalized today. Lt. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> operations center in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said Sunday a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter had found the spot where the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Queen sank. `` Our concern is that it's a hazard to navigation,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. The captain, 26-year-old <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Chale </PERSON>, said the boat was in 40 feet of water `` when we hit something, hit a submerged object. Whatever it was, I have no idea. I never saw it.'' The boat immediately began taking on water and went down at the harbor entrance about 15 miles southeast of the <LOCATION> Verrazano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Narrows </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, which connects <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chale </PERSON>'s girlfriend, said she was inside the boat when she heard the whistle announcing it was time to head back to the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, the boat's port. She went out to join her grandmother, mother and aunt on deck and `` I saw the back of the boat was all full of water.'' The passengers helped each other don life preservers and jumped into the water to be rescued because <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels could not get close enough to the sinking boat, Ms. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. They were picked up by rescue boats. `` We did n't even feel the cold of the water until we were out of the water. Everything happened so fast,'' she said.

<HEAD>Challenges Great As Multiparty Democracy Takes First Steps</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the completion of its first multiparty election ever, this island of 20 million people, already credited with an economic miracle, is poised for a political one. But the challenges are great. The political equation of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was rearranged over the weekend. Observers hailed the vote as a step forward for democracy even though it was marred by allegations of widespread vote-buying. `` A Nationalist Setback, Redistribution of Political Power,'' read one newspaper headline. Most stunning, indeed, were the losses suffered by the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> for 40 years after fleeing a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover on the Chinese mainland. Nationalist candidates polled 58 percent of the popular vote, down from 70 percent in 1986. Next in line came the strong showing of a feisty 2-year-old opposition party, which won important posts in local elections and gained in the national Legislature. `` This is a glorious victory,'' said opposition leader <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi-yuan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> is deputy secretary general, garnered 33 percent of the vote and independent allies swelled its total to nearly 40 percent. Two years ago, it won 22 percent. Much of the party's support came from native Taiwanese, who make up about 80 percent of the population but were displaced politically when the Nationalists seized power in 1949. A third development was the relatively free debate in the campaign. One candidate, a former dancer, ran on a platform of free love. She lost. Others openly risked charges of sedition when they called on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to declare itself independent from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and abandon the dream of recovering the mainland. At least 20 of 32 members of a pro-independence group won seats in various contests. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s rapid economic growth in the 1970s created an increasingly sophisticated population, which chafed at laws that could jail men and women for speaking their minds. Several years after the 1975 death of autocratic President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>, the Nationalists began experimenting with political reform. Martial law was lifted in 1987 after 38 years; limited press freedoms were granted; political parties were legalized. But many said reforms came too slow. And the vote Saturday appears to be a rejection of the pace of change in a political system that still perpetuates Nationalist rule. Television and radio remain under Nationalist control and were criticized throughout the campaign for anti-opposition reporting. Even if the opposition won every vote, it could not have challenged Nationalist control. The 256-seat Legislature and the electoral college are dominated by hundreds of elderly Nationalists elected for life on the Chinese mainland in the late 1940s and frozen in office to support the party's claim to be the legitimate ruler of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Despite the problems, the oppositions made huge gains. In the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, the opposition and its allies won at least 21 seats, up from 12 seats. For the first time in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s history, the opposition can introduce legislation because 20 co-sponsors are required for each bill. The opposition also captured six of the country's 16 county executive posts and other local seats. With these victories, the opposition is presented with the challenge of proving it can run a local government and solve environmental problems and a skyrocketing crime rate. The opposition also can move to limit the far-reaching control of the Nationalists over everyday life. A model cited by many is an independent candidate who was elected as county executive of <LOCATION> Ilan </LOCATION> in 1986 and is dismantling the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> machine in his district. Surveillance files kept on government employees were burned, pictures of Nationalist leaders were taken down, political indoctrination is being reduced in the schools and a nuclear power plant, backed by Nationalists, was stopped. `` One of the first things I will do is demolish the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters,'' said <PERSON> You </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching </PERSON>, in a speech to supporters after he won the executive seat in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> county. `` Then you will be able to walk your dogs on the property.'' Still, pundits have warned opposition candidates not to push the Nationalists too far too fast. Although possibilities for a conservative backlash appear slight, the Nationalists might be tempted to pass legislation limiting the power of the local governments and negating opposition gains. Such tactics could spark unrest among the people. Allegations of vote-rigging during the election caused thousands to surround county offices. Early today, about 10,000 protesters who accused the Nationalists of vote fraud ended a 30-hour siege of a government office in southern <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. For the Nationalists, the election challenged an aging party that has grown somewhat fat on the luxury of one-party rule. `` We calmly accept an upset,'' Party Secretary General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Soong </PERSON> said after a hastily held meeting of party leaders Sunday. `` We shall continue with reforms and improve what we did not do well.'' Some in the party have called for faster political reforms. `` The vote shows the people demand change,'' said C.L. <PERSON> Chiou </PERSON>, a political science professor. `` The Nationalists must bend with the wind.''

 Mayor-elect <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said he was not worried by a federal probe into a stock transfer to his son, said to be part of a larger investigation into a cable television franchise. `` I'm confident this inquiry will reveal that there's nothing with which I need to be concerned,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said Sunday. `` Those of us in public life are subject to criticism and scrutiny of all sorts over time.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said the investigation stems from a suggestion by his defeated opponent in the Nov. 7 mayoral election, Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who said during the campaign that the stock deal should be examined. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, described the federal investigation as `` <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s last hurrah.'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> is the former <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney based in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, is investigating the transaction of stock by <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> to his son, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Investigators are trying to determine whether <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> transferred <ORGANIZATION> Inner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock to his son through a genuine transaction in 1985, how much the stock was worth and whether all due taxes were paid, the News reported Inner City owns several radio stations and one of its subsidiaries has a substantial interest in <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Innerunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, a cable franchise. Inner City's chairman, former <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Borough President <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, is a longtime friend of <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> has said he first acquired stock in the privately held company in 1972 and his holdings grew to 588 shares, largely through stock splits. After his election as <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president in 1985, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said, he began transferring the stock to his son to avoid a conflict between his position on the city <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> and the board's role in regulating cable television. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Driscoll </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, characterized the investigation as a `` preliminary inquiry into some financial transactions.'' She refused to elaborate. During the campaign, it was revealed that <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> had not paid a gift tax. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> released a handwritten note, dated Oct. 30, 1985, in which his son agreed to buy the stock. But <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> declined to release financial or corporate records that might further document the transaction. As part of the investigation, the News said, the age of the paper and ink are being tested to determine whether the note was written in 1985 or during the campaign. There also are plans to analyze the handwriting, the newspaper said. The city's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a separate, previously disclosed probe into whether <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> filed misleading financial disclosure forms pertaining to the stock.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Sexual Harassment in Large U.S. Law Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sexual harassment and limited opportunity for advancement are part of a woman's work environment at large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law firms, a study says. The survey, published in today's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, was based on responses from 918 women lawyers who work in large law firms in 13 cities. Most women said they were at a disadvantage when it came to advancement. Sixty-four percent said men had a better chance at gaining management positions and 49 percent said men were more likely to be promoted. According to the survey, 60 percent of respondents said they had experienced unwanted sexual attention, such as sexual teasing, remarks or questions, from co-workers or clients. Nearly one-third said they had experienced sexual looks or gestures. The lawyers who responded to the survey earned between $ 50,000 and $ 250,000 a year. Thirteen percent said they felt their male counterparts earned higher salaries and bigger bonuses. The majority of the women felt they had to give up time for family, friends or outside interests to pursue their law careers, but they indicated that male lawyers made the same sacrifices. The survey participants worked in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>.

 Its monopoly on power gone, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is on the run, looking desperately for new strength in the forthcoming political battle for control. Communists were the vanguard of reform during the ill-fated `` Prague Spring'' under <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> until the spontaneous freedom movement was squelched by Soviet tanks in 1968. But new forces seem to be in charge this time around. `` The future requires giving up the monopoly of power,'' new party leader <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said last week. A 77-year-old veteran Communist says it's `` hard to foresee any kind of real political comeback for the party, now that the lies and incompetence are here for everyone to see, hear and read about. The man, requesting anonymity, said `` only a miracle'' can save the Communist leadership from collapse now that the 2-week-old peaceful popular revolt has shaken it to the core. In a stormy party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commitee </ORGANIZATION> meeting Nov. 24, former premier <PERSON> Lubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON> called the demonstrations `` an expression of civil dissatisfaction with us, our way of leadership and rule.'' `` Let us admit our share of responsibility,'' the party daily <PERSON> Rude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pravo </PERSON> quoted him as saying. Days later, the party decided to revise its stand on the 1968 <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion, part of its speedy move to jettison the leaders and policies of the last 21 years. Those aging party members, who carried the torch of `` real socialism'' from the 1948 Communist takeover until November 1989, have been spared a younger Communist generation's worries about the party's future. `` I'm of the opinion that the entire <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> should be disbanded and possibly associate under a different name, if we find the right program and people willing to do it,'' <PERSON> Vit </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanhel </PERSON>, 43, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> journalist, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. That has already happened in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where the unpopular <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dissolved itself last month and christened a new ruling party _ the Socialists _ as part of its attempt to save itself from overwhelming defeat in free elections next year. With a membership of 1.7 million _ roughly one in every six Czechoslovak adults is a Communist _ the party is still the best organized political force in the country. It may be hit by massive defections now that its power is eroded. But it still has control of thousands of offices and factories and many of the people who run them. <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, the country's leading dissident and the unofficial leader of the Civic Forum opposition coalition, says that by comparison his group is composed of `` political amateurs.'' The country's <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, formerly docile <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> allies, have now begun to flourish in the new atmosphere of free speech. Membership applications are pouring in, but both parties still remain comparatively tiny forces of less than 50,000 members. A broad spectrum of several independent parties, similar to that in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, is expected to emerge before free elections take place, probably late next year. Czechoslovak wits are beginning to mourn the easy target they found in the Communists for 40 years. Hinting at the clumsiness of former leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and the depressing obscurity of the new communist chief, the writing on the subway wall said last week: `` Milos, come back, <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> is no fun!''

 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> says it will be difficult to find a competent lawyer to defend an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman accused of hiding weapons for leftist guerrillas. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Sunday that the woman, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, had decided to stand trial in the case rather than be deported. He said that even with a good lawyer, `` it would be extremely difficult if not impossible'' for Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> to get a fair trial amid the pressure of war and the near paranoia about foreigners in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> was due to be arraigned today, he said, most likely before a military tribunal. He was not sure precisely what charges would be filed. Authorities say they uncovered a huge guerrilla arms stash buried in her yard. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> did n't know the munitions and explosives were there. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, who represents a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio-based </LOCATION> ecumenical group called <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminars </ORGANIZATION>, is deeply committed to her work in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, he said. The formeer attorney general, who has been retained by Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s family but is not licensed to practice law in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said he had hoped Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> would agree to be deported rather than tried but that is not the case. `` Every heart has to be somewhere and her heart chose <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>,'' he said. `` She does n't want to go home.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> has begun a ministry inside the jail where she has been held since her arrest Nov. 26. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, 28, a native of <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, moved into the house in May but was not at home for long periods of time, including all of September, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s friends say she is being framed to justify a government crackdown on churches and humanitarian groups that came in reaction to a three-week-old guerrilla offensive. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, has denied any connection with Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, who was known for her work guiding visiting church groups and congressional aides. The rightist government has imposed a state of siege that suspends most constitutional rights, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has passed a severe new anti-terrorism law. The bill has not yet been signed by President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in 1985 after working for two years with Central American refugees in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Authorities say they found more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition for AK-47 assault rifles, 213 blocks of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, detonators, 106 60mm mortar rounds and other munitions buried in her yard. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> is being held in a cell with two other women, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>, the Sandinista revolutionary hero turned Contra rebel leader, has ended eight years of exile and told supporters that neither <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should influence <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The legendary fighter known as Commander Zero was mobbed on his arrival Sunday at the airport in the Nicaraguan capital. A caravan of vehicles carried him and supporters to the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, where he and about 20 fighters in 1978 held legislators hostage until then-President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> released 50 <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> prisoners, including <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON>, now the president and the interior minister. `` I have come to take over the palace that's called <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> told several hundred supporters, who cheered wildly at the reference to the bold exploit that made him known worldwide. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> said the Social Christians _ not the leftist government or the U.S.-backed opposition coalition _ are the true followers of Nicaraguan nationalist hero <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON>. `` We are anti-imperialist with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and we are anti-imperialist with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> told the crowd at the adjacent Plaza of the Revolution. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> scoffed at Sandinista accusations that he betrayed the revolution when he left them to fight in 1983 with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. He said the Sandinista commanders are the `` true counterrevolutionaries'' because their standards of living now are much higher than most Nicaraguans. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> also said that although he personally respected opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, her 14-party <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> was made up of opportunists and followers of the late <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>'s reception at the airport, organized by two factions of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was the largest by far for any of the many exiled leaders who have returned to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> this year to join the political fight against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. On the way downtown, <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> waved tentatively at people standing on sidewalks waiting for buses, many of whom stared back with blank expressions. Standing with <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> were <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Two months ago <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> threw his support behind <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>'s presidential candidacy after splitting from Ms. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> has run a fishing cooperative in neighboring <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> since he ended three years with the Contras and quit the armed struggle against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. When the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power in 1979 in a popular revolt that forced <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> to flee the country, <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> was named vice minister of defense and enjoyed wide popularity. But the man who called himself a nationalist was at odds with his more radical leftist comrades and grew disillusioned with the Sandinista revolution. Some say he grew bitter because he was not made defense minister. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> distanced himself from the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in 1981, then dropped from sight. He emerged in 1983 and said he would fight the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. But he constantly criticized his <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, saying they misspent money. The Contras welcomed the propaganda coup provided by his defection but also eyed him suspiciously because of his independent streak and former Sandinista ties. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> survived a 1984 bomb explosion that killed four people, including an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist, during a news conference in his jungle hideout on the Costa Rican border. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> withdrew financial support for <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> and soon after he quit the fight.

 Romanian gymnast <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> says she fled for the West without saying goodbye to her parents, and began her journey with a cold, six-hour hike to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> during which she risked arrest or worse. The Olympic champion has kept out of public sight since arriving Friday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and holding a brief news conference. An account of her escape to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was published in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, The Mail on Sunday, which reportedly paid <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> for the story. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> endured a muddy, nighttime trek through country terrain before reaching the Romanian border with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, she said. `` I could not bring anything else with me, not even my precious gold medals or a photograph of my family,'' she was quoted as saying. She said she left without saying farewell to her parents. `` I could tell no one I was escaping,'' she said. `` I even had to lie to my brother. I was frightened, of course I was. I was scared of being picked up by the Romanian authorities.'' The Mail said it interviewed <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, 28, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Saturday night. Today's editions of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> quoted the Mail reporter as saying <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was paid for the interview. <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Auer </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

In the newspaper interview, <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> said she and a friend, <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Panit </PERSON>, left her parents' home in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> in a rented car Nov. 26 and headed for the town of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> near the Hungarian border. Six other friends also had crowded into the car, and Panit dropped them off 10 miles from the Hungarian border at about midnight, the newspaper quoted <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> as saying. `` We were stumbling and often crawling through water and ice,'' <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> said. She said the group encountered no border guards although they heard their dogs barking. `` We did n't even think what would happen if we were caught alive. It almost certainly would have meant going to prison in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>,'' she said. They reached the border after walking for six hours, having veered miles off their planned route, <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> told the Mail. The group was stopped by a Hungarian border patrol and taken to police headquarters at <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. Early Wednesday, the group left <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>'s defection, the Mail said, was arranged by <PERSON> Panit </PERSON>.

 ARRIVE is a school that pays students $ 10 just to show up, but there are two requirements for admission: recent release from jail and a history of intravenous drug abuse. The program works to develop a social-services network to help its students get back into society _ and get what they need if they develop AIDS. `` The primary purpose of the program is to stop the transmission -LRB- of AIDS -RRB-, but to do that you have to help people get their lives together,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON>, program director for ARRIVE _ a loose acronym for AIDS Risk Reduction and Education for Former Intravenous Drug Abusers Entering Society. Still, ARRIVE classes, which meet three nights a week, cover far more than AIDS awareness. `` I want us to quickly identify some of the things that stress us out,'' Clinical Director <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Josepher </PERSON> told a class of about 25 people, mostly black men, who had gathered one night in a Lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office building. `` Trying to deal with life now without the use of drugs,'' responded one man with a graying goatee. `` It has been so long.'' `` Dealing with your children when they're young,'' said another, to a chorus of agreement. `` Dealing with a crack son,'' said a woman. In the beginning, few women enrolled. Now one of the 24 classes deals specifically with women and AIDS. In the early days, the cookies did n't last through the evening; the organizers learned some students had nothing else to eat. At least one showed up directly from jail, suitcase in hand. ARRIVE has evolved in another way, too. It has become something of an advocacy force for a high-risk population without a voice. Since the start of 1988, intravenous drug users have accounted for more of the AIDS cases reported in the city than any other group. In an anonymous random sampling, about 35 percent of state prison inmates tested HIV-positive. ARRIVE helps students draw up resumes and look for jobs, especially in drug and AIDS counseling. It gives out subway tokens, and offers a 24-hour source of support, even to those who return to drugs. `` We have to deal with the fact that they're going to experiment and they will be pulled back into old behaviors,'' said <PERSON> Josepher </PERSON>. Sometimes the streets win. Thirty-seven percent of those who entered ARRIVE did n't graduate, according to figures from its first five groups of students. Dropout figures are n't available for its two most recent groups, including one that graduated Friday. Some graduates get stipends to help others through the program. In August, one helper was shot to death in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. Many students left jail to find the streets changed _ filled with younger faces and more violence revolving around crack. `` I've gotten a lot of feedback from our students that they feel like outsiders,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, an ARRIVE trainer. `` Producing a lot of discomfort for people who've had a history of substance abuse will drive them back to the drug.'' Those who stick it out are often people who've shown their strength before. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> got himself off speedballs, a mixture of heroin and cocaine, at age 24. At 30, he was ordered imprisoned for nine years for manslaughter; once inside, he sent himself back to school. Now, he works for <ORGANIZATION> Narcotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which runs ARRIVE, going to prisons to recruit prospective students. He lives with a sister who's on crack. His brother is an intravenous drug user. `` I knew that I would either come back out here and be part of the problem or part of the solution,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON>, 35, freed herself from a whirlpool of cocaine, alcohol and compulsive gambling. `` I used to gamble my food stamps,'' she said. She joined ARRIVE with her husband, who is in a drug-rehabilitation program. At home, she tells their six children, ages 4 months to 16 years, what she learns at ARRIVE. `` I want to go to school and teach children about AIDS,'' she said. `` I want to spread what I learned.'' ARRIVE is funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, and the students are part of an experiment that will compare them with other ex-cons who get less treatment or no treatment at all. All told, a research subject can earn $ 280 for completing the program. It's enough to bring people in but not enough to keep them, says <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON>. `` People who do n't get motivated, who do n't get connected, they just leave.'' It helps that the teachers know well where the students have been. <PERSON> Josepher </PERSON> says he and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> spent time in jail and used drugs. `` One of the main problems in the beginning is imparting to them visions of hope,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` I've got to teach them about self-respect,'' said <PERSON> Josepher </PERSON>. `` I've got to help them to see that they're self-destructive and this translates into anger directed at themselves.''

<TEXT>
 Hospital patients face a greater risk of infection or inappropriate surgery because many hospitals are n't meeting quality standards, according to the head of a group that monitors health-care facilities More than a third of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals failed to meet quality standards designed to guard against inappropriate surgery, unnecessary blood transfusions and poorly coordinated treatment in special coronary and intensive-care units, according to a report in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. The report also found that more than 40 percent of hospitals were cited for violations of safety standards, ranging from inadequate electrical wiring to improper disposal of hazardous waste. The report was based on surveys of 5,208 facilities collected from 1986 to 1988 by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accreditation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healthcare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, which sets quality standards for health-care facilities. The Chicago-based commission said it had not analyzed the data to determine how many violations were major. But the commission's president, Dr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON> <PERSON> ` </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, said, `` Compliance problems mean that there is a greater risk of a bad outcome, such as infection in the hospital, or a transfusion reaction or a surgical misadventure. `` We consider that to be serious,'' he said. <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said more and more hospitals are letting their buildings run down because of financial pressures. `` Do hospitals have adequate resources to really comply with the standards? Maybe not,'' <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported that the commission found that: _ Fifty-one percent of hospitals did not have adequate procedures for reviewing surgery to determine whether it should have been done and whether it was done correctly _ Fifty-six percent did not properly monitor and evaluate how well the medical staff in different departments gave care _ Fifty percent did not properly monitor what happened to patients in special intensive-care and coronary-care units _ Thirty-five percent did not always review blood transfusion procedures to determine whether a patient needed a transfusion and whether whole blood or blood components should have been used Blood components carry less risk of infection from viruses that can not be detected by current screening tests, such as hepatitis C. About five-sixths of the nation's hospitals are surveyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, whose seal of approval qualifies them to get Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements without an extra government inspection. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bader </PERSON>, a quality consultant based in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said the pattern of problems indicated that physicians are increasingly reluctant to review each other's care in the hospital, either because of the time required or the fear of lawsuits. That does n't mean patients are getting poor care, only that hospitals often are uninformed about what kind of care they are giving, <PERSON> Bader </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the commission should publicly disclose its compliance data for individual hospitals. `` If you're going to be a regulatory agency, you have to let the public know what you're finding,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said.

 Borders to the West opened today and Czechs and Slovaks crossed over them by the thousands as their country's Communist authorities allowed the first unrestricted travel in decades. `` Maybe this is truly freedom,'' said <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaz </PERSON>, who drove through the <LOCATION> Bratislava-Berg </LOCATION> crossing with his wife and 14-year-old daughter en route to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, 42 miles away. The new open-border policy took effect at midnight. <PERSON> Balaz </PERSON>'s car was among more than 100 lined up at the crossing when the Czechoslovak and Austrian border guards shook hands, then opened the barrier at 12:04 a.m. Czechoslovak border guards reported a relatively light flow of traffic at the 20 rail and road crossings to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> throughout the morning _ probably a reflection of today being a regular working day. Austrian border officials said about 900 Czechoslovak cars had passed through the Bratislava-Berg crossing by noon. At other crossings, the number of Czechoslovaks traveling to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> was much smaller. `` Instead of a storm, just a breeze,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Austria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> headlined a report, referring to the unexpectedly low number of visitors. The news agency said most of the Czechoslovaks were sightseeing and few had enough convertible currency for shopping. However, for those who had lined up at the <LOCATION> Bratislava-Berg </LOCATION> crossing, the mood was ebullient as the barrier lifted. `` This is an indescribable feeling,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurny </PERSON>, 25, as he and his brother, <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON>, drove their yellow <ORGANIZATION> Wartburg </ORGANIZATION> sedan onto Austrian territory. Television lights and a small crowd of well-wishers with a sign reading `` Welcome to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'' greeted the new arrivals. The Communist government announced Thursday that all obstacles to travel to the West would be removed. It was among the concessions granted after weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of people. The move came after the East German government, spurred by similar mass protests, announced nearly one month ago that it was opening its Western borders, including the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, travel regulations introduced in 1987 had made visits to the West easier for Czechoslovaks than for most citizens of other Soviet-bloc countries, but there were still formidable bureaucratic obstacles. Before the borders opened today, those seeking to go West needed a passport. They also needed authorization from the police, from their workplace or school and in some cases from local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials to get an exit visa. They also had to have invitations from relatives or friends in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Now they need only to show their passports and fill out a brief questionnaire giving their names, addresses, the country they will visit and the duration of their stay. Only one Czechoslovak soldier was on duty at the <LOCATION> Bratislava-Berg </LOCATION> crossing of a two-lane road when the first Austria-bound cars arrived about 10 p.m. <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurney </PERSON>, 22, said, `` I'm just going to drive across and then drive right back. I just want to see if it works.''

 Anyone brave or foolish enough to venture outside in the country's swankiest district was a target. Even nuns were shot at in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> today, where fighting between rebel and loyalist soldiers pinned down hundreds of foreigners for a third day. Insurgent snipers had sheltered themselves in apartment buildings and hotels. Canadian Ambassador <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Simard </PERSON> said the rebels were using Americans, Japanese and others as `` human shields'' in their flagging 4-day-old coup attempt. At least three people were reported slain in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> today and 15 wounded, including one American, in the fighting. Earlier, spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> Makati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said 10 people were killed. They said the discrepancy was due to an error in records. Hundreds of rebel soldiers swarmed into <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>'s commercial district Saturday, turning about 20 luxury hotels and high-rise apartment and office complexes into snipers' dens. They shot at anyone venturing outside. `` Literally, we're in the middle,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Julich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businesswoman trapped in the Intercontinental Hotel. `` -LRB- We're -RRB- now low on food. There are babies in the building, and there is no baby food, and the mothers are hysterical. `` We saw were a group of nuns trying to walk where the tanks are. They were eventually shot at and took cover.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Huchel </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, estimated 210 Americans in three luxury hotels in the battle area. He said that did not include scores of other Americans who may be living in expensive apartments nearby. `` It's not a hostage situation, -LRB- but -RRB- `` they just ca n't leave,'' he said. The presence of the foreigners and residents has prevented government forces from waging an assault to wipe out the last pockets of resistance, and officials believe the standoff could last for days. Ambassador <PERSON> Simard </PERSON> blamed the rebels for keeping the foreigners in the area, home to the country's two stock exchanges and its most exclusive boutiques. `` They're certainly using these people as human shields, in my view,'' he said. Electricity was cut briefly today after a stray bullet knocked out a transformer. The Japanese newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> said all 600 guests at the <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> were herded into the basement Sunday when rebels entered the building to demand food. It was not clear if they were still there. <PERSON> Asahi </PERSON> said about 300 Japanese were trapped in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> hotels and another 300 were living in apartments in the area. `` My advice to them is to stay away from windows, stay in your room and keep good courage,'' said West German Ambassador <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON>. `` We have to live out this phase.''

<TEXT>
 A Swedish court today identified a Palestinian living in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> as a suspect in the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 and approved the seizure of evidence during a raid on his apartment last week. The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, granting a request by Scottish detectives to authorize the seizure of 15 bags of clothing, said it found <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abo </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> `` is suspected in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> of murder or as an accessory to murder.'' The court said the clothing taken one week ago from <PERSON> Abo </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>'s apartment `` can be presumed to carry significance for the investigation'' and the seizure was therefore legal It was believed to be the first time a suspect has faced a court proceeding for the explosion Dec. 21, 1988 of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> that killed 270 people. <PERSON> Abo </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>, 35, was in jail awaiting a verdict on separate charges of murder and attempted murder for complicity in a series of bomb attacks in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> in 1985 and 1986. One bomb in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> killed one person and wounded more than 20. <PERSON> Abo </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>, a former activist in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> group, was linked to Flight 103 when it was established that he was in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> two months before the explosion. Investigators reportedly traced clothing bought in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> to the suitcase which they believe also contained the bomb. The pressure-sensitive bomb apparently was transported in the suitcase from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where it was put on board the New York-bound flight, according to the investigators' reported theory. Seven Swedish policemen and three Scottish detectives raided <PERSON> Abo </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>'s apartment last Monday, apparently searching for clothing that could be linked to the shreds found in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. On Friday, the public prosecutor, acting on behalf of the Scottish detectives, asked the court to sanction the seizure as legal. Under Swedish law, evidence taken for a police investigation outside <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> must be authorized by a court. The court also must approve its removal from the country. The decision, which was printed and distributed at the courthouse by a clerk, said that any property removed from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> must be returned at the end of the investigation. It also confirmed a previous decision to classify the court records in the case as secret. <PERSON> Jamila </PERSON> <PERSON> Mograbi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abo </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>'s ex-wife who still lives with him, said detectives took all the family's clothing, and she said she had to borrow clothes from friends for herself and her two children. Speaking to reporters on Friday, she said the policemen searching the apartment questioned her for one hour and that she was called to an <LOCATION> Uppsala </LOCATION> police station later in the week for further interrogation. According to court documents, <PERSON> Abo </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, served in the Egyptian army and underwent training in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in handling anti-aircraft missiles. He deserted in 1970 to join the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a radical offshoot of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. He returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for further training in 1980. <PERSON> Abo </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> immigrated to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> in 1986.

<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, who is emerging as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s top political figure, is a reform-minded Communist long shunned and criticized by the former hard-line leaders. Many see <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, 61, as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s equivalent to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose domestic programs of greater openness and economic restructuring caught on among the East German public. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> was elected premier, or head of government, on Nov. 14 after years of waiting as local party leader in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>. He was named today to handle any <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> issues that arise during the current <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It was also <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>'s duty to inform the edgy <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> leadership about the growing upheaval in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the Soviets have nearly 400,000 troops. Despite the clear signs of ascent, it is still too early to predict who will finally come out on top as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> goes through widespread and seemingly uncontrollable changes. The Communist Party, which still counts an estimated 2 million members, is preparing for an emergency session on Dec. 15-17 that will elect a new leadership. But even then, with party support dropping and a greater risk of a breakup, the Communists' future is increasingly clouded. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> himself has been among those giving a gloomy assessment of the party's chances, saying the Communists would get no more than 20 percent of the vote if promised free elections were held today. The premier, in his inaugural speech to Parliament on Nov. 17, appealed for more private enterprise to help rescue the country's troubled economy <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is `` open for proposals on joint ventures, investment, transfer of profits and environmental pilot projects,'' all of which address some of the concerns of Western businesses looking for openings in the East German market. He called for a `` better socialism'' with more supplies of consumer goods for the nation's 16.5 million people. He rejected talk of German reunification as `` dangerous and unrealistic'' while calling for increased treaty links between the two countries. Long known as an anti-establishment Communist, <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> was the target of an inquisition led by then hard-line leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. The attacks temporarily derailed his career as a nationwide leader, forcing him to stay as local party chief in his power base of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>. In June, central authorities singled him out for rare public criticism, saying he had failed to control `` bourgeois and enemy views'' in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> after a large demonstration of citizens demanding freedom of travel to the West. An engineer by trade and the holder of a university economics degree, <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> already has wielded far more clout as premier than his colorless predecessor, <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON>. Many East Germans as well as Soviet officials made plain they would have preferred <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> in the post of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> secretary, but the job went to <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> protege <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> on Oct. 18. As 10,000 demonstrators rallied in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Sunday, many carried placards saying all of the top Communist leaders should quit except <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>. With <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> now out, that leaves open the possibility for a <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> shot at the top party job _ if the structure stays the same. There are already growing warnings about a possible breakup of the troubled party, while many say a name change at least is possible. Married and the father of two children, <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> began his party career as chief of the Communist youth organization in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> from 1953 to 1961. He won election to the 163-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1967 and became <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> party secretary in 1973. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> won massive support in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, in part because he rejected party perks and insisted on living in a normal apartment. His wife reportedly waited in lines at stores like other local homemakers. The premier stunned East Berliners by walking home, rather than being driven, after his Nov. 17 speech in Parliament.

 The Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia today pounded two Shiite Moslem towns with artillery fire, killing four people and wounding 18, police said. The bombardment, just north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone, coincided with renewed fighting between the two main Shiite militia factions in the southern villages of <LOCATION> Sohmor </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yohmor </LOCATION>. Police said at least 20 people were killed or wounded in the hostilities between the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, and the Amal militia.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of a radical leftist group hurled firebombs and stones today at riot police trying to remove huts built illegally on the site of a proposed new runway at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s international airport, police said Police fought back with water cannons, but there were no reports of injuries, said an offical of the <ORGANIZATION> Chiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prefectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official said <PERSON> Masaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Komurasaki </PERSON>, a 27-year-old member of the Battle Flag leftist group, was arrested for allegedly constructing a tower on the construction site. About five people atop the tower, which was several yards high, threw firebombs and stones as riot police moved in with bulldozers and backhoes to get rid of about 10 huts built inside and near the site of the planned runway, officials said. Local farmers and their supporters, including radicals seizing on the issue for their anti-government activities, have been resisting the government's plans to expropriate farmland to expand the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>, which opened in 1978 with just one runway. Complaints of congestion have been growing, and the government plans to complete construction of another 8,250-foot runway within next year. Today marked the start of police action to clear the huts. The official said 5,000 riot police were mobilized to block off the area. Another 1,500 riot police are to be mobilized to strengthen checkpoints on roads leading to the airport, he added. About 230 opponents, including members of the Chukakuha, another radical group opposed to the airport, are living in huts and other structures there, police sources said. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> says eight farmers still live inside the planned expansion site. Transport Minister <PERSON> Takami </PERSON> <PERSON> Eto </PERSON> told a news conference he had apologized to local farmers for the government's choosing <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> as the airport site, ministry officials said. <PERSON> Eto </PERSON> said his apology was contained in a letter mailed Saturday in reply to a protest letter sent by some farmers. <PERSON> Eto </PERSON>, the first transport minister to make such an official apology to farmers, said he would like to have talks with farmers opposing the airport, the officials added.

<TEXT>
 Opposition leaders urged people to stage mass demonstrations today to protest a new Cabinet that did not meet their demands. Thousands of Czechs and Slovaks poured across the nation's newly opened borders. The opposition Civic Forum also threatened a general strike to protest the government named Sunday. All but five of the new Cabinet's 21 members are Communists; 11 members, including Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, are holdovers. Civic Forum denounced the appointments and called for new protests today on <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the center of two weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations that forced the Communists to bow to demands for reform. There were no demonstrations by early afternoon. In the past nine days, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has seen its 41-year monopoly on power removed from the constitution, been forced to oust hard-line leaders and reversed 21 years of policy by admitting that 1968's Soviet-led invasion that crushed reform was a mistake. Today the government lifted virtually all restrictions on foreign travel, and border guards reported a light but steady flow of traffic at the 20 rail and road crossings into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. It was the first unrestricted travel in decades. `` Maybe this is truly freedom,'' said <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaz </PERSON>, who drove through the <LOCATION> Bratislava-Berg </LOCATION> crossing with his wife and 14-year-old daughter en route to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, 42 miles away. The open-border policy took effect at midnight, and by noon about 3,000 Czechoslovaks had crossed into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Border guards said traffic may have been relatively light because today was a workday. Lack of hard cash might also have kept travel light. Striking students, whose protests of police brutality at a Nov. 17 demonstration sparked <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s peaceful revolt, greeted radio reports on the Cabinet with derisive laughter at their headquarters. They dropped plans to end the strike and return to classes today. The call for a new protest and Civic Forum's general objections to the new government were printed in state-run dailies. Only one newspaper, the trade union daily <ORGANIZATION> Prace </ORGANIZATION>, carried the threat of a general strike. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a Civic Forum spokesman at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s CKD heavy industry factory, said there would be a general strike next Monday unless a new government is announced by Dec. 10. `` It's the only way for citizens to show what they want,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, one of several opposition representatives interviewed on state television. Theater director <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Machacek </PERSON>, representing striking actors, said artists were ready to back a general strike. `` We have to fight to the end, until we are certain that the path to freedom in this country is irreversible,'' he said. Strike committees at enterprises nationwide have remained on alert since last week, when millions followed an opposition call to strike for two hours to show they reject one-party rule. The next day, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> agreed to drop the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leading role from the constitution and form the first coalition government in 21 years <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Pithart </PERSON>, a Civic Forum representative, said the opposition wants to replace Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jaromir </PERSON> <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON>, a holdover criticized for his defense of harsh human rights policies, and Energy Minister <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Krumnikl </PERSON>, held responsible for widespread pollution. The opposition also seeks new laws that would guarantee <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> assembly </ORGANIZATION>, association and a free press, and pave the way for free elections. First Deputy Premier <PERSON> Bohumil </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, in announcing the new government team at a news conference, said `` all the demands of Civic Forum could not yet at this stage be respected.'' Some of the unmet demands included a civilian defense minister and a non-communist head of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which is in charge of police. The five non-Communists included three people without party affiliation, and one person each from the Socialist and People's parties, traditionally allied with the Communists but more independent in recent months <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hromadka </PERSON>, a high-ranking leader of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> church, became one of seven deputy premiers Communist authorities have traditionally kept a tight rein on religion, exercising veto power over all church appointments in this nation, which is 65 percent Roman Catholic. Gen. <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacek </PERSON> became defense minister, and Communist <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinc </PERSON>, a political unknown who had served as director of a nuclear power station, was named interior minister. At its first meeting, the new government condemned the 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion and appointed <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> to negotiate with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the future of the estimated 80,000 Soviet troops stationed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> since. The move was clearly intended to try to gain suport from a population that was horrified by the invasion and hated the leaders installed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> afterwards to crush the `` Prague Spring'' reforms. The last of those leaders left in power is President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who indicated as he swore in the new Cabinet on Sunday that he may step down. `` I do n't have any ambitions to remain in my function,'' he said, according to the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>. He added, however, that a decision to quit would come only after consultations between political and oppposition groups. The opposition has demanded his resignation by next Sunday. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> left Sunday for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> leaders are meeting. Each country that took party in the 1968 invasion has now officially criticized its participation.

 Who's a Who? That's the question the editors of `` Who's Who in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' must decide as they prepare listings for the 1990-91 edition of the reference book. Actor <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> will be listed in the new Who's Who. But Mr. T, star of the canceled `` A-Team'' TV series, will not be. Baseball slugger <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Canseco </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION>'s is a Who, but <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> rookie of the year, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> centerfielder, is not. `` <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> was rookie of the year, true,'' explained <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, product manager for Who's Who In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` But you do n't know What about his sophomore year? What if he fizzles?'' Once someone is listed, it's for life, until retirement, until someone asks to be left out or until conviction for a serious crime, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. Sometimes the editors look the other way at a conviction, as in the case of Watergate convicts <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>, H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Colson </PERSON>, who continue to be listed. Thousands of questionnaires were mailed this fall from Who's Who headquarters in this northern <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb to Nobel laureates, federal judges, movie stars, Fortune 500 company officials, newspaper editors, junior partners in major accounting firms, up-and-coming lawyers, and others. Researchers at the headquarters comb through newspapers, magazines and corporate reports for prospective listees. `` We try to be as objective as we can be in our standards,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` We try to quantify quality.'' Those who return the questionnaires, providing information about their accomplishments, memberships, education and the like, are guaranteed a place among the 79,000 people to be listed in the new edition, due out in September 1990. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said the expected return rate is only 12 percent to 14 percent. Years ago, as many as 20 percent returned the questionnaires. He said the rate has dropped because people are confused by the proliferation of such books _ many of them vanity press publications that charge for a listing. In contrast, `` Who's Who in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' a publication of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, makes clear in its preface that its entries do n't have to buy the book <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said he receives up to 50 unsolicited nominations for new entrants each week _ either from admirers or the would-be personalities themselves. The publication has been in business since 1899. New editions are published every two years. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> publisher, founded the publication after seeing a similar book in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The idea was not to confer celebrity status on certain people, but to provide a useful reference book to businesses and libraries. The book does have a history of keeping a Who or two out. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was refused a listing for years because <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> objected to the architect's unsettled married life. <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> also barred 1930s Hollywood star Mae West from the big red book. That prompted her to respond, `` Well, the old boy who publishes that is n't in my little black book, either.''

 A black man was killed and at least 13 people, including eight policemen and a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member, were hurt when officers clashed with hundreds of blacks trying to attend a protest meeting, police said today. Constables were pelted with stones and responded by using stun grenades, rubber bullets and tear gas, policesaid. The clash occurred Sunday in <LOCATION> Edendale </LOCATION>, near the <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> capital of <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, after more than 2,000 blacks gathered to attend an anti-government meeting. Authorities had refused to allow the meeting to be held at a stadium, and it was moved to a meeting hall that could accommodate only about 1,000 people. Police said those who could not fit inside became disorderly and began stoning officers and their vehicles. The police report did not specify how the death occurred.

<HEAD>Home Sales Down Again, But Show Improvement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of new homes edged down 0.5 percent in October, the sixth monthly decline of the year but a major improvement over the previous month, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 649,000 units in October, after a 10.2 percent plunge in September. The September decrease was revised downward from a 14 percent fall originally reported last month. Fixed-rate mortgage interest rates fell to 9.82 percent by the end of October after rising into the double digits in September. Analysts had said the lower rates would lead to an improvement in the housing industry. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that sales of existing homes remained steady in October at their highest level since last January and <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> chief economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said then that `` home financing conditions probably will stay quite favorable in the months ahead.'' The housing industry was among the hardest hit when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> pumped up interest rates last year to slow the economy and thus contain inflation. But as inflationary pressures cooled, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has permitted gradual decreases in rates since the beginning of the summer. The Realtors association reported today that its index measuring the ability of the typical American family to buy an existing home rose in October to its highest level in eight months because of stable rates and a drop in the median home price. The real estate group said the index rose to 106.1, from 103.5 in September and the highest since it measured 106.7 last February. That means a family with a median income of $ 33,365 had 106.1 percent of the income needed to buy a median-priced existing home costing $ 92,100. The median means that half of the families earn more and half less, or that half the homes sell for more and half for less. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report today said the median price of a new home was $ 127,900 in October, up 5.3 percent from $ 121,500 in September. The average price of a new home was unchanged at $ 151,900. New-home sales for the first nine months were down 4.4 percent from the same period in 1988. Sales rose 47.8 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> but fell 24.7 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The South posted a 5.7 percent increase, while the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> recorded a 3.7 percent gain. The Realtors, meanwhile, said a family in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> earning the median income of $ 37,329 had only 76.1 percent of the income needed to buy median-priced existing home costing $ 143,300. In the West, a family earning the median income of $ 35,299 had 74.1 percent of the income needed to buy a home priced at $ 142,200. In the South, a family earning the median income of $ 30,533 had 107.4 percent of the income needed to buy an $ 83,400 home, while a Midwestern family earning the median of $ 33,511 had 137.5 percent of the income needed to purchase a home priced at $ 70,900.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> resigned today and King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> named his court chief, <PERSON> Mudar </PERSON> <PERSON> Badran </PERSON>, to form a new government, official sources reported. The new Cabinet will have the task of negotiating with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, including Islamic fundamentalists, on legislation An official at the prime minister's office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON>, 55, a distant cousin of the king, will take over as royal court chief. The appointment of <PERSON> Badran </PERSON>, 55, who has the reputation in the Arab world of being a strong, persuasive politician, came as a surprise. Most observers had expected <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> to stay on and form a new Cabinet. <PERSON> Badran </PERSON>'s appointment signaled concern over the deterioration in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s relations with neighboring <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military occupation of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that a new Cabinet will have to seek a vote of confidence in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> within 30 days. The new Cabinet will include former ministers, some members of the royally appointed senate and some of the newly elected 80-member <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Under <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s constitution, <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON>'s government had been expected to resign following the Nov. 8 parliamentary elections, the first nationwide poll in 22 years amid King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s move toward wider democracy. <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> formed his transitional government April 27 following a wave of riots in southern <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> over price hikes in basic food commodities and fuel. At least nine people were killed. He was charged with overseeing the general elections and halting a sharp slide in the economy that has cut per capita income from $ 2,000 a year to about $ 1,200. <PERSON> Badran </PERSON> is known to sympathize with extremist Moslem factions, including the Moslem Brotherhood movement, which won 25 seats in Parliament in the recent elections. Nine other fundamentalists also won the election. The new government will have to negotiate with the fundamentalists to pass its own legislative program through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which approves all laws and has the power to dismiss prime ministers and their Cabinets. But ultimate authority remains in the hands of the king, who has the power to dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and rule by decree.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in an important banking industry case, agreed today to decide whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks with branch offices overseas must pay depositors after foreign governments seize or freeze those accounts. The court said it will review rulings that required <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> to pay depositors. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nomination was defeated by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, is representing <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>. In the appeal acted on today, <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> said billions of dollars are at stake. There are more than 900 branches of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks operating in 73 countries, with some $ 225 billion in deposits. The case acted on today stems from economic troubles in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in 1983. <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> deposited $ 2 million with the <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> branch in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in June 1983. The money was to be repaid with interest six months later. But on Oct. 15, 1983, the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was deposed and fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1986, froze the accounts of foreign banks. The move prevented <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> from repaying the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> deposits to <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> sued to recover the money, and <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> later paid it $ 934,000. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> withheld the balance of the original deposit. A federal judge in 1987 ordered <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> to repay the balance in 1987, and the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the ruling last July. The appeals court relied on an agreement between the two banks that suggested <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>'s home office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had the duty to pay the money. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal in the Philippine case, and to rule in the bank's favor <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers offered their views at the request of the high court.

<TEXT>
 U.S.-backed Afghan insurgents said today that an Afghan army general and three guerrilla commanders were killed in fighting outside that nation's eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Guerrilla sources also claimed to have crushed a major offensive by the communist government to retake strategic positions outside <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital. <LOCATION> MIDIA </LOCATION>, a news agency run by various guerrilla factions, reported that Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Haider </PERSON> was killed Saturday when Moslem insurgents launched an artillery attack on army headquarters in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Guerrillas said <PERSON> Haider </PERSON> was the third Afghan army general to be killed in fighting in the past month. The guerrilla news agency claimed three government army officers were captured and a fourth defected during fighting outside <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. The insurgents have been trying for nine months to capture the strategic city. The guerrillas also said three of their key commanders were killed during the past week. They said <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON>, a commander who uses only one name, died when he stepped on a mine outside <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> while trying to retrieve the bodies of some fighters killed in an earlier clash. Guerrilla sources said <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> was a leader in offensives earlier this year that eventually gave the insurgents control of the 45-mile strategic highway leading from <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. The guerrilla news agency said commander <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Matin </PERSON> was hit in an artillery attack near <LOCATION> Rodat </LOCATION>, about 24 miles west of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. It said commander <PERSON> Zarab </PERSON> <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeni </PERSON> died along with five rebels during a weekend attack on government positions near <LOCATION> Surkhrud </LOCATION>, six miles west of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. The city has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting in the guerrilla's 11-year-old war to overthrow successive communist governments in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The insurgents began their battle for the city last March, about three weeks after the last Soviet soldiers left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Their departure ended nine years of Soviet military intervention. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s ruling communists control most of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s cities and the insurgents control most of the countryside. The guerrilla news agency claimed that an estimated 3,000 government troops, led by <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister Gen. <PERSON> Shahnawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanai </PERSON>, tried unsuccessfully to rout insurgents from posts at <LOCATION> Chakaray </LOCATION> and Illajay, outside <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The fighting, which reportedly was centered about 18 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, could not be independently confirmed. The guerrillas claimed they destroyed eight government military vehicles and killed 45 soldiers before repulsing government troops. They declined to say how many rebels were killed. The guerrilla news agency also said that fighters ringing <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> used anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down a government transport plane Saturday. The report did not say how many people were on board but that all were killed. Insurgents have been fighting for months to capture <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, about 18 miles west of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The seven most powerful Afghan guerrilla groups are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which helps channel U.S.-supplied weapons to them. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> arms the Afghan government.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Ruling on Hazardous Waste Shipments in Alabama
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today left intact a ruling that limits the power of states and their citizens to block shipments of hazardous waste from other states. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> officials who failed to prevent shipments of hazardous waste from an abandoned <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> chemical refinery to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> officials said they were denied a fair opportunity to oppose the shipments. The plans for removing the waste to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> were approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> under the so-called Superfund law of 1980, aimed at helping clean up toxic waste. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> included an abandoned <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> petrochemical plant in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> among priority sites to be cleaned up. The site is contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls -LRB- PCBs -RRB- and other toxic chemicals. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials in 1986, in cooperation with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials, approved removal of the waste to another location. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials signed a contract with <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- CWM -RRB- to have 47,000 tons of the waste shipped to the company's treatment facility in <LOCATION> Emelle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> officials, led by Gov <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, said they unlawfully were denied a chance to participate in the process that led to the selection of the <LOCATION> Emelle </LOCATION> facility. A federal judge temporarily blocked the shipment of the waste. But the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overruled the judge in April and permitted the waste to be deposited at the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> site. The appeals court noted that the <LOCATION> Emelle </LOCATION> facility is licensed by <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and the federal government to handle such toxic wastes. The appeals court added that federal laws controlling disposal of toxic substances `` ensure that <ORGANIZATION> CWM </ORGANIZATION>'s toxic waste storage and treatment facility poses the least possible risk to human health and safety.'' The appeals court also rejected arguments that the Constitution and federal laws guarantee <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> citizens and officials the opportunity to express opposition to such shipments before they take place. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration supported the appeals court ruling. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers noted that the Superfund law was amended in 1986 to bar challenges to clean-up decisions until after the clean-up is completed. The law `` does not preclude'' challenges such as the one made by the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> officials, the government said. It only delays them `` until after remedial action has been taken and thus -LRB- the law -RRB- is clearly constitutional.'' The case is <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Enviromental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, 89-378.

<HEAD>Court Agrees to Hear California Water Supply Appeal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to hear arguments favoring states' rights and consider limiting the federal government's power to control water used by hydroelectric dams. The court said it will hear a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> appeal supported by more than 40 states. The water-rights dispute pits the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> against <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sided with the federal commission, and environmentalists supported the state agency. The commission in 1983 licensed construction of a hydroelectric power project on <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, a small tributary of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Placerville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The dam's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, plans to generate electric power and sell it to <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The state water resources agency sought to limit the flow of water over the dam by requiring that enough water continue flowing in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> to assure survival of trout. But the federal commission in 1987 said it has exclusive control over how much water should flow over the dam. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in favor of commission last June, saying the Federal Power Act `` strongly suggests that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended to vest final authority for the regulation of hyrdroelectric power projects in federal hands.'' The appeals court said that interpretation of the law is supported by a 1946 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, which it said gave states control over water distribution only for limited purposes _ for irrigation and city water supplies. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended federal law to pre-empt state regulation in all aspects of hydropower projects save for the limited proprietary exceptions specified'' in the law, the appeals court said. Permitting the state to limit water supplied to the dam `` could jeopardize the economic feasibility of the project'' and undermine the federal licensing authority, the 9th Circuit court added. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s appeal was supported by a friend-of-the-court legal brief signed by the attorneys general of 43 other states. The only states not signing were <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The 43 states said the appeals court ruling, if adopted nationwide, would `` fundamentally alter state control of water resources and eviscerate comprehensive state regulatory systems for allocating water.'' Leading environmental groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said `` ill-conceived hyrdroelectric development'' should not be shielded from state regulation. But administration lawyers urged the justices to reject any call for what they said would be unworkable dual control over hydroelectric projects. The case is <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION>, 89-333.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a ruling that women in a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> prison must receive a lawyer's help with their appeals. The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> for Women who were ordered to provide the equivalent of at least one half-time lawyer to assist inmates. One of the issues the appeal raised was whether courts, without finding past intentional sex bias, may order prison systems to offer female inmates the same access to courts male inmates receive. Inmates at the women's prison in <LOCATION> Peewee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, sued over conditions there in 1980. The suit alleged, among other things, that the inmates did not have adequate access to courts because the law library was inferior to those available to male inmates at the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> State Reformatory. After a four-week trial in 1982, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> ruled that the state had violated female inmates' equal-protection rights by not providing them with the same court access as male inmates. He ordered state authorities to provide a library identical to those at the two prisons for men, to increase the hours women could use their prison library and to provide free legal help. Only that part of <PERSON> Johnstone </PERSON>'s order calling for legal help was appealed. It was upheld by the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last April 10. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the prison officials argued that the hiring of a part-time lawyer should not be required. `` There is no justification,'' the appeal said. `` There is no formula ... -LRB- to -RRB- measure the success of this part-time attorney. There are no limits to the assistance provided by counsel.'' The appeal was supported in a `` friend-of-the-court'' brief submitted by 13 states. They are <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.

The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and the others may be sued under a federal anti-racketeering law. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, his business partners and an engineering firm are being sued by tenants of the <LOCATION> Parkchester </LOCATION> apartment complex in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The lawsuit said the defendants concealed structural defects in the buildings, the presence of asbestos in insulation and the need to replace electrical systems and plumbing. They are charged with violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -LRB- RICO -RRB-. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in January said the charges against the defendants, if true, constitute a pattern of racketeering activity as defined by the RICO statute. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last July ordered the appeals court to restudy that decision after the justices themselves handed down a similar ruling in a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> telephone rates case. The high court said the RICO act can apply to even a single fraudulent scheme that has the threat of continuing illegal activities. The justices said the law may be invoked against business fraud, not only traditional forms of organized crime. After re-examining the <LOCATION> Parkchester </LOCATION> case, the 2nd Circuit court in September reaffirmed its original ruling and permitted the suit. The suit is separate from a federal tax evasion criminal case that resulted in the conviction of <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Leona </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was found incompetent to stand trial on the criminal charges in that case because of memory loss and reasoning problems caused by several slight strokes.

Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case, but four votes are needed to grant such review. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, residents of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, sued a <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> car dealership, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in 1987 after experiencing what they said were numerous problems with the new car they had bought three months before. The sales contract the Warrens had signed called for binding arbitration of any dispute. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> immediately sought to freeze the lawsuit until arbitration was completed, contending such action was required under the Federal Arbitration Act. In past decisions, the nation's highest court has ruled that the federal law precludes a state court proceeding over an alleged breach of contract if the disputed contract affected interstate commerce and contained an arbitration clause. A state trial judge granted the dealership's request but last July 7 the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the federal law did not require freezing the Warrens' lawsuit. The state court said the sale of a car by an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> dealer to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> residents is not covered by the federal arbitration law because the two contracting parties did not comtemplate `` substantial interstate activity.'' In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> argued that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> never intended the federal law to be so narrowly confined. The appeal was supported in a `` friend-of-the-court'' brief submitted by two associations representing over 1,000 car dealerships in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. They said the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling deprives car dealers of their right to enforce arbitration agreements. Lawyers for the Warrens urged the justices to reject the appeal. They said the federal arbitration law's provisions `` never were intended to apply to contracts ... involving the consumer purchase of a product by a citizen of one state from a retailer residing in the same state.'' The case is <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, 89-567.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders are pledging support for liberalized trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in response to the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit, but some members urge caution against speeded-up arms control talks. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., called the weekend meeting a `` successful and constructive summit'' but warned of pressure that it might exert on ongoing weapons-reduction negotiations `` There's nothing wrong with the leaders giving a push to the arms control negotiators, but there would be danger here if we pushed them so hard and so fast that we get a bad agreement, rather than one that will stand the test of time,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ended their two-day summit on Sunday, hailing a new era of East-West peace. Both leaders said they would meet again in June in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with the possibility of agreements in 1990 to cut long-range nuclear weapons and conventional forces as well as progress toward a chemical weapons ban. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> proposed that the superpower leaders set up teams to discuss long-range cutbacks beyond agreements currently being negotiated. `` Conceptual discussions now should not have to wait the details,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said, adding, `` But neither should we start negotiating new things which would even further delay the existing negotiations.'' Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> also expressed concern that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might be putting too much pressure on arms control negotiators to reach agreements. `` I'm a little bit concerned about trying to put a deadline on any arms control negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, adding, `` I hope that was n't done.'' He said he needed more details of the summit talks before making a final assessment. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' said the summit put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` back in the global arena. He's providing leadership, and that's good for all of us.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, called the first Bush-Gorbachev summit a `` successful meeting'' which should lead to both weapons reductions and a better economic relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, also interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, said he supports `` most favored nation'' trade status for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but said it would not likely produce any significant increase in sales of Soviet-made goods in this country. `` They've got some things to sell but not much that <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> or other countries will want to buy,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. The administration has promised to give <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> increased benefits, and to support its bid to participate in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international trading organization, in exchange for Soviet relaxation of emigration restrictions on Soviet Jews. Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Sunday Today,'' said he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to have more trouble with Republicans than Democrats in getting ratification of treaties with the Soviets He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> likely would repeal laws that restrict trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is ready and prepared to support that, so long as the Soviet performance on immigration remains good, which it has been in recent months,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> upstaged the summit, reaffirming the fact that `` the two most powerful countries in the world do n't make all the key decisions about the world. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> in a statement also called the two-day superpower session a `` potatoes summit. The meaty summit will come next summer.'' `` The potatoes summit is important, nonetheless,'' said <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, who hailed the unprecedented joint Bush-Gorbachev news conference for making it clear that `` our differences have not disappeared ... and we can cope with them in a civilized manner, that is to say, in a political rather than a military way.''

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Intervene in Georgia Desegregation Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected a plea for intervention from <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, school officials who have been ordered to consider racial desegregation measures that include busing. The court refused to block a ruling that the county's school officials take further steps to integrate the 73,000-student school system, the largest in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on Nov. 22 temporarily blocked enforcement of a desegregation ruling by the 11th <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to give him more time to study the county's emergency plea. He then referred the case to the full court. The county, in suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, has been under court order to desegregate its schools since 1969. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Kelley </PERSON> ruled last year that the county had done all it could to integrate its schools, agreeing with officials that housing patterns were the primary cause of any remaining racial segregation in public schools. That decision was overturned last October by the 11th Circuit court, which said officials must consider `` pairing and clustering'' schools in different parts of the county to attain racial balance, a move that would require busing. School officials said the appeals court ruling sounded a `` death knell'' for neighborhood schools in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the three states encompassed by the 11th Circuit. The school officials cited a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in a case from <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which they said means a school district already under a desegregation order may not be forced to correct racial imbalances in student population unless found responsible for creating those imbalances. The case is <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, A-401.

 Rebel soldiers positioned in hotels and high-rises fired on government troops in the <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> financial district today, refusing to end a 4-day-old mutiny and trapping hundreds of people in homes and hotel rooms. A rebel spokesman said the trapped foreigners would be freed Tuesday but he said this did not mean the mutineers were giving up their fight to oust President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` We pledged our lives to this cause. We will hold the line to the last drop of our blood,'' said the spokesman, Capt. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Yen </PERSON>. Two bombs exploded in the city, injuring two people. It was unclear if they were related to the coup attempt, which began Friday and has killed at least 70 people. Hundreds of Americans and other foreigners were pinned down in homes and hotels in the post <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> district, where forces loyal to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> contained the mutineers to 22 buildings. Rebels shot at anyone venturing outside. `` Literally, we're in the middle,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Julich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businesswoman trapped in the Intercontinental Hotel. `` -LRB- We're -RRB- now low on food. There are babies in the building, and there is no baby food, and the mothers are hysterical. `` We saw were a group of nuns trying to walk where the tanks are. They were eventually shot at and took cover.'' At least three people were reported slain in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> today and 15 wounded, including one American, by rebel snipers and in fighting between rebel and loyalist forces. Earlier, spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> Makati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said 10 people were killed. They said the discrepancy was due to an error in records. Government troops forced the surrender of more than 600 rebels Sunday, and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said the coup attempt had been crushed but that it would take several days to complete `` mopping up operations.'' This is the sixth and most serious coup attempt against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Insurgents seized <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> on Saturday, trading fire with government troops and sending bystanders racing for cover. Government forces appeared reluctant to attack for fear of killing foreigners. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Huchel </PERSON> said about 215 Americans were believed trapped in three hotels in the wealthy district. An undetermined number of others were believed trapped in luxury apartments. Hospital sources identified the American wounded as <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissburg </PERSON>, who they said was hit in the arm by glass when a bullet shattered the window of his room at the Peninsula Hotel. They did not know his hometown. Yen telephoned news organizations in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and said foreigners would be free to leave hotels at 10 a.m. Tuesday -LRB- 9 p.m. EST Monday -RRB-, to dispel any ideas they were held hostage. The foreigners will be taken to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s airport aboard shuttle buses, Yen said. At least 70 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded since mutineers seized several military installations and bombed the presidential palace Friday, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for counterattacking loyalist forces later that day. On Sunday, loyalist troops fought off a furious attack by the rebels on the military headquarters at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aguinaldo </LOCATION>, and about 600 mutineers surrendered. About 400 rebels were still occupying <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Their leader refused to give up and threatened to blow up the base's planes. Officials arrested one coup participant who approached the defense chief with a grenade during a news conference. Also today, an explosion occurred in the compound of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. There were no injuries. A second bomb went off in the <LOCATION> Ermita </LOCATION> entertainment district, damaging an unoccupied minibus and shattering windows. Two women were injured by flying glass. In the morning, the estimated 390 rebel holdouts in <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> _ members of the army's <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> _ refused appeals to surrender and fired at soldiers and civilians who approached their strongholds. The mutinous soldiers claim Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, swept to power in a 1986 military-civilian uprising that ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, has failed to deal effectively with the country's Communist insurgency and economic problems. One of the coup leaders was <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, a cashiered lieutenant colonel who once supported Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> but later led an August 1987 attempt to overthrow her. He remained at large. The city's international airport reopened today but domestic air service was indefinitely postponed. Schools were closed but government employees were ordered to return to work except in the <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> area. Officials reported shortages of food and fuel from interruptions caused by the fighting. More than 10,000 people fled their homes to escape the fighting and were housed in schools, churches and other refugee centers. Most provincial garrisons did not join the mutiny, but there were indications of widespread support among junior and middle-grade officers. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, guards arrested an army sergeant who tried to bomb a news conference held by <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> and military chief Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, an official said today. Sgt. <PERSON> Romy </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> -LRB- no relation to the president -RRB- was moving toward the officials with a grenade when arrested Sunday afternoon, said Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON>, chief of the military's <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

 Arctic air howled across the nation's northern tier today, and winter's bite was felt as far south as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where a possible frost kept citrus growers checking their trees and sun lovers all bundled up. Heavy snow buried parts of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the Great Lakes states. Some snowbelt areas received nearly 2 feet of winter's white by early today. Schools were closed in two counties in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and in northern areas of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Pickens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, 14 inches of snow fell and temperatures dipped to 6 degrees overnight. The frigid winds were expected to drop wind chills to 50 degrees below zero in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, the cold apparently killed two homeless men, police said Sunday. The wind chill dipped to minus 11 Saturday night. At <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s Bar in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, a man in his mid-60s who gave his name as `` Hard Rock,'' said he knew the victims. He feared more homeless would meet the same fate. `` This is going to happen all winter _ people dying in the cold,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, where temperatures dipped to near zero, police found the body of a 60-year-old homeless man outside a trailer Sunday morning. `` He had apparently tried to get into the trailer,'' Police Officer <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Macey </PERSON> said. The wintry weather was blamed for at least four other deaths this weekend. Three people died in two separate traffic accidents on snow-covered <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> highways, while one person was killed in a crash on an icy <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> road. In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Loring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in Limestone reported 26 inches of snow on the ground late Sunday. But an additional foot of snow may fall before the storm ends, forecasters said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said some areas of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> were expected to receive almost 2 feet of snow by the end of the storm. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a hamlet 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, received 18 inches by late Sunday. The snow did n't keep everyone in. A fund-raising event at the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> drew 60 people, and at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Market </LOCATION> a steady stream of customers filed by cashier <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>. `` We've had people coming in and they say it is up to their knees,'' she said. Squalls produced up to a foot of snow in northeastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and in western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. In the Deep South, cold winds blew across <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Temperatures with the wind chill factor plummeted as low as 10 degrees in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Winds gusted to 30 mph Sunday night in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the season's most severe cold was expected to send temperatures to near record lows before warming later this week. Lows today should range from the mid-20s in the Panhandle to the mid - to upper 40s in the Keys, according to the weather service But many citrus growers said they were n't too worried about the chill. `` Actually, a cold snap like this can be quite beneficial,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He said temperatures in the 30s accelerate citrus growth and put the trees into a dormant phase, which make them more resistant to future cold weather. Heavy damage occurs when temperatures go below 28 degrees for more than four consecutive hours, he said.

 State Attorney General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a leading contender for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, announced a shift in his position on abortion, angering anti-abortion activists. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON>, who had voiced a strong anti-abortion position since entering the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1975, told reporters Saturday he supports public funding of abortions for low-income women and would veto legislation to ban abortion. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> said he now believes women should have the right to choose abortion until the fetus is determined to be viable, at which point the rights of the fetus become paramount. The switch comes amid growing evidence that a strong anti-abortion stance can be a political liability. Abortion played a prominent role in the recent gubernatorial races in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and pro-choice candidates won both elections. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> was expected to announce his candidacy later this month for the Democratic primary to be held in May. `` My own beliefs lead me to conclude that abortion is almost always the wrong solution to the problem of unwanted pregnancy,'' he said. `` Public officials, however, have a special obligation to explain what role the government they serve ought to play in the abortion decision.'' But <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON>, spokesman for Republican gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, who opposes abortion, said <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> ca n't have it both ways. `` I think this is a shocking reversal. Here's a person who says he wants to run on his record, then the first thing he does is run away from his record,'' he said. <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION>, called the announcement good news for the <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> campaign. `` It is perfectly valid to change one's mind, especially on something as important as this,'' she said.

The court said it will hear a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> appeal supported by nearly every other state. _ Left intact a ruling that limits the power of states and their citizens to block shipments of hazardous waste from other states. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> officials who failed to prevent shipments of hazardous waste from an abandoned <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> chemical refinery to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. _ Agreed to decide whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks with branch offices overseas must pay depositors after foreign governments seize or freeze those accounts. The court said it will review rulings that required <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> to pay depositors. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> said billions of dollars are at stake. There are more than 900 branches of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks operating in 73 countries, with some $ 225 billion in deposits. _ Rejected a plea from <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, school officials ordered to consider racial desegregation measures that include busing. The court refused to block a ruling that the county's school officials take further steps to integrate the 73,000-student school system, the largest in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The air pollution case involves pollution from car paint at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, and focuses on the joint federal-state system for cleaning up the atmosphere Under the federal Clean Air Act, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> sets national air quality standards. The states are required to adopt plans to meet those standards, and submit the plans to the EPA. The federal agency in 1980 approved a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> plan for reducing pollution from paint at auto assembly factories. The plan required car makers to comply fully with the federal rules by Dec. 31, 1985. But <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials extended the deadline for any plant switching from lacquer paints to enamel, which emits less pollutants. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> initially planned to stay with lacquer at the <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> factory but in June 1985 announced it would convert to enamel by the summer of 1987. The company asked that it not be required to comply with the Dec. 31, 1985, standards until 20 months later. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> officials approved <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal and submitted a revised plan to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 30, 1985. Without waiting for federal approval, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> began building a $ 200 million plant in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> to use the enamel system while continuing to operate its factory that uses lacquer paint. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials went to federal court in August 1987 seeking fines of up to $ 25,000 a day against <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for 20 months of air-quality violations at the old <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> plant. It was not until September 1988 that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> rejected the state-approved pollution control system at the new plant. A federal judge barred the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> from imposing fines against <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for violations of the Dec. 31, 1985, standards. The judge said the federal agency itself violated the Clean Air Act by taking more than four months to rule on the state-approved plan submitted Dec. 30, 1985. But the 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last June said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to meet the four-month deadline does not disqualify it from fining companies that violate previously approved pollution control rules. The public should not be penalized with dirtier air because of what often are unavoidable EPA delays, the appeals court said. It told the trial judge to decide how much the fines should be, stating he should take into account whether the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s delay was reasonable and what impact the delay had on <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> joined <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> in urging the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review the air pollution dispute. <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the 1st Circuit court ruling is an incentive to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to treat companies unfairly. They said it conflicts with decisions by other federal appeals courts. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said the 1st Circuit court's ruling was correct. The case is <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 89-369.

 Retirees will have to continue paying monthly premiums for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic coverage at least until May, even though the program is being repealed this month, federal officials said today. That much time will be required to adjust and test the government computers that now withhold the premiums from monthly Social Security benefit checks, Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said in an interview today. She said the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> hopes to stop deducting the premiums starting with the benefit checks that arrive in early May. Refunds of the premiums could take three or more months beyond that date. The $ 4-a-month premium for catastrophic coverage is scheduled under the law to rise to $ 5.30 on Jan. 1. Although <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted last month to repeal catastrophic protection, the bill has not yet been presented to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature. `` My concern is for those on fixed income who can not afford to see $ 5 go out of their checks,'' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` That's a lot of money for those people and it is little consolation for them to know they will get a refund in the future.'' The prospect of seeing retirees continue to have to pay the premiums does not sit well either with Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` I fear that a lengthy delay will create a firestorm of protest,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said in a letter to Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> that was made public today. `` We must recognize the impending firestorm and move repidly to alleviate the problem.'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said many retirees will need the $ 5.30 a month to pay the expected increase in rates for private `` Medigap'' policies as a result of repeal of federal coverage. Catastrophic coverage was enacted last year to protect people 65 and older from being bankrupted by a major illness. The program fell into disfavor with many retirees, especially those who already have private coverage and higher-income people who were faced with an income surtax of up to $ 800 a year for catastrophic. As a result of loud complaints from those groups, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed last month to kill the program. The monthly premiums that have been deducted from benefit checks this year will not be refunded; they will pay for hospital and other benefits that have been in effect all year. Few retirees have been paying the surtax. Those who have paid it through quarterly estimated tax payments will get a larger-than-expected income tax refund next year.

<TEXT>
 Following is the text of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference Monday following his meeting with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I have a statement and then I'll be glad to respond to your questions. This year, the people of the East made fundamental choices about their destiny and governments there began to honor the citizens' right to choose What these changes amount to is nothing less than a peaceful revolution. And the task before us, therefore, is to consolidate the fruits of this peaceful revolution and provide the architecture for continued peaceful change, to end the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to make <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whole and free. Great choices are being made, greater opportunities beckon. The political strategy for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> that we agreed upon last May makes the promotion of greater freedom in the East a basic element of Alliance policy. Accordingly, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should promote human rights, democracy and reform within Eastern countries as the best means of encouraging reconciliation among the countries of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Although this is a time of great hope, and it is, we must not blur the distinction between promising expectations and present realities. We must remain constant with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s traditional security mission. I pledged today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will maintain significant military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, as long as our allies desire our presence as part of a common defense effort. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will remain a <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> power, and that means that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will stay engaged in the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and in our common defense. Many of the values that should guide <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s future are described in the final act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. These values encompass the freedom of people to choose their destiny under a rule of law with rulers who are democratically accountable. I think we can look to the <ORGANIZATION> CSCE </ORGANIZATION> to play a greater role in the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The 35 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> CSCE </ORGANIZATION> bridge both the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. It's a structure that should be able to contribute much to the future architecture of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. I also appreciate the vital role that the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> must play in the new <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And it's my belief that the events of our times call both for a continued, perhaps even intensified, effort of the 12 to integrate and a role for the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> as a magnet that draws the forces of reform toward <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And that's why I was exceptionally pleased that we agreed at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> economic summit on a specific role for the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> in that group of 24 effort to assist <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. We stand on the threshold of a new era, and we know that we are contributing to a process of history, driven by the peoples determined to be free. The people of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, especially the brave citizens of the East, are illuminating the future, and yet, the outcome is not predestined. It depends on our continued strength and our solidarity as an alliance. Our transatlantic partnership can create the architecture of a new era and a new Atlanticism, where self-determination and individual freedom everywhere replace coercion and tyranny, where economic freedom everywhere replaces economic controls and stagnation, and where lasting peace is reinforced everywhere by common respect for the rights of man. I now would be glad to respond to some questions. And we've got to be out of here in about _ a little after quarter of. Q. Mr. President, I have a two-part question. You've made it clear that you are going stay in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But in view of the dramatic reduction in tensions and the obvious weakening of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, what will be the real American role? And two, will there now be more money for the poor and the homeless, public housing? The nation is really badly in need of repair of infrastructure. A. We have a lot of demands at home, and there's no question about that. But I think it is premature to speak as some are at home about a `` peace dividend'' _ take a lot of money out of defense and put it into other worthy causes. And so I _ I _ as I started over the budget figures for the next budget cycle we are under a tremendous burden to get our total spending down in order to meet the Gramm-Rudman and the Gramm-Rudman targets. In terms of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role, I think I set it out here pretty well. We will continue to play a very active role in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. I see nothing that diminishes the importance of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And I might say that I gathered from our interlocutors there _ the other heads of state and government _ that they want us fully involved. And I _ I _ thinking back on my talk with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, I do n't see any conflict there either. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, your trusted adviser and the ambassador to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, said that he envisions a _ said that <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, East and West, will be reunited withint five years. Do you think that's possible? And what would be the implications for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact? A. I am not into the predicting of time on the question of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Let me just _ I do n't know whether the secretary general read you these points. Let me just read the four points that represent the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position on reunification. MORE

 <LOCATION> BRUSSELS </LOCATION>: on reunification.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Self-determination must be pursued without prejudice to its outcome, and we should not at this time endorse any particular vision. Secondly, unification should occur in the context of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s continued commitment to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, an increasingly integrated <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, and with due regard for the legal role and responsibilities of the Allied powers. Third, in the interest of general European stability, moves toward unification must be peaceful, gradual, and part of a step-by-step basis. And these were _ and lastly, on the question of borders, we should reiterate our support for the principles of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act. So, I am not trying to accelerate that process. I do n't think our allies are. I think Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> feels comfortable with the four points I have just read. And so I think it's better to let things move on their own and without the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> certainly setting some kind of deadline. Q. Mr. President, you said, in announcing your meeting with Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, that one of the main reasons was that you wanted to make sure that, in this time of change, you did n't miss anything. In your two days of meetings, did you learn anything that you fear, or feel, that you might have missed, had you not had this? A. Yes. What I would have missed is I would n't see quite as clearly his priorities. I see them more clearly because he and I sat down and talked. We had about eight hours of talks _ some private. And I feel I can sense much more clearly the things he feels more strongly about. And we had a good chance to point out to him some of the difficulties with our relationship. It was n't all sweetness and light. I had a very _ very good opportunity to tell him how we view the _ our problems in our own hemisphere: the sending of arms in there to help the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, and the role that _ unhelpful role _ that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is playing. I recited in detail the Oscar Arias phone call to me: `` Please raise with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the unhelpful role, the destructive role of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' So I think it's more emphasis, although we did put forward some general themes on the economy. And I think he was pleased, because I think from his standpoint _ and this is important from mine _ he now sees that we want to have a cooperative, forward-leaning relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Q. Mr. President, you have, perhaps more than any contemporary American president, exercised personal diplomacy, establishing personal friendships with a wide variety of leaders. Are you prepared now to say that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is your friend? A. I'll say this: We had a very friendly _ conversations, and then once in a while there were _ a little tension there. But it was extraordinarily friendly in the conversation aspect. I do n't know how you go further than that in definition But I'm convinced that he is determined to do that's what _ that what he told me he's doing _ reform, perestroika Openness _ we totally agree on is a democratic value. So, Brit, what happened was, I think he took my measure and I took his, and I think we just feel more comfortable about our common objectives. Yeah, <PERSON> John </PERSON>? Q. I want to go back to what <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> asked you about. You said that you had made an <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> policy. ... A. Keep talking _ I'm just _ going to get some water. Q. After World War II, the Europeans needed our money for the Marshall Plan. Then they needed our military backing because of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> threat. But now, if the Soviet military is a question that one of your successors will have to deal with _ eventually what are they going to need from us? What role do we really have to play here? We do n't live on this continent. A. Well, we have a tremendous interaction, if you want to hypothetically project that _ that guaranteed peaceful time, I would say interaction with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on student exchanges, cultural exchanges, economic matters. I mean, there's a tremendous potential for a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that is in accord with us on these democratic values. It's a tremendous market, for example, but it needs the economic reform. So what we've got to do is be sure that we conduct ourselves in such a way that the changes, the political reforms, can keep going forward there in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, that they can _ that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can do what Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is trying to do internally. And then there's just enormous potential for living at peace with that tremendous power. Q. Sir, maybe I misstated my question. What I really mean is, what _ why do <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europeans </LOCATION> need us once the military threat recedes _ the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europeans </LOCATION>? Why would there have to be a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>? This is a political and military alliance, and it's really only a political alliance because of the military need. A. You mean _ would _ why will there always have to be a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence? Q. Why will there always have to be a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>? A. Well, I'm not sure _ I'm _ if you want to project out 100 years or. ... Q. Well, no. ... A. _ take some _ take some years off of that, you can look to a utopian day when there might not be. But as I pointed out to them, that day has n't arrived, and they agree with me. And so the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must stay involved. What we do n't want to do is send the signal of decoupling, the decoupling of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, particularly at this highly sensitive time, and Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> understood that. He made that point to me. Yes? Q. Did President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ask your forebearance in case he decided to crack down on dissidents, and if so, what did you say? Or what role did the question of ethnic and Baltic dissent have in your meeting? A. The answer to the first part is no. And the answer to the second part is I asked him to describe for me the problems inside _ the nationality problems inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and he did it in considerable detail. Yeah? MORE

<HEAD>EPA Calls for Curbs on EBDC Family of Pesticides</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 2 grafs with crops affected by withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assoicated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> today called for sharp curbs on the widely used EBDC family of pesticides, proposing that the chemical no longer be applied to 42 crops including apples and tomatoes because of concerns about cancer. The proposed regulation, which would not become final until early 1991, would allow the continued use of the EBDC fungicides on 10 crops including grapes, onion and cranberries. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the use of the <ORGANIZATION> EBDCs </ORGANIZATION> _ known as maneb, mancozeb and metiram _ on the remaining 10 crops `` do not present an unreasonable risk.'' The agency estimated the maximum risk of someone getting cancer from a lifetime of exposure at three in 1 million. With the chemical's current widespread use that risk is 4 in 10,000, it said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> applauded a decision announced earlier this year by EBDC manufacturers to withdraw the chemical's use on 42 crops But he said `` we do not believe that goes far enough'' and proposed that the ban apply as well to three additional crops _ tomatoes, bananas and potatoes. The manufacturers have said they would begin their voluntary curbs at the end of the year. EBDC use on the other three crops would not go into effect for at least 18 months unless producers choose to incorporate them in their voluntary curb. The EBDC chemicals, which began to be used in the 1930s, are among the most widely used fungicides, with as much as 18 million pounds manufactured annually for use on most common vegetables as well as grains. But the fungicide has come under attack from environmentalists and health specialists because a breakdown product called ETU has been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Chronic exposure also raises the risks of birth defects or thyroid disorders, scientists said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said that while the health risks associated with <ORGANIZATION> EBDC </ORGANIZATION> use on any one crop may be negligible, `` the cumulative risks -LRB- associated with its widespread use -RRB- has been determined to be unreasonable.'' The health risk estimates are based on the maximum allowable dosage of the fungicide on various crops. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said those estimates likely are greater than residue levels found in the marketplace because the fungicide is easily washed off. Crop producers as well as state agriculture departments had asked the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to hold off proposing restrictions on the <ORGANIZATION> EBDCs </ORGANIZATION> until a marketbasket survey currently under way is completed to provide a clearer picture of residue levels actually found on crops by consumers. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> said in a letter to <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> that several states already had reported results of surveys and `` to date no significant residues of <ORGANIZATION> EBDCs </ORGANIZATION> have been found.'' Environmental groups, however, have criticized the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> for moving too slowely in getting the <ORGANIZATION> EBDCs </ORGANIZATION> off the market, noting that a final regulation on the chemical will not be issued until the spring of 1991. Under the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> proposal, <ORGANIZATION> EBDCs </ORGANIZATION> would continue to be used on grapes, wheat, cranberries, onions, sugar beets, sweet corn, peanuts, almonds, asparagus and figs. The 42 crops on which EBDCs currently are used, but would no longer be used under voluntary curbs by the chemical's manufacturers, are: Apples, apricots, barley, casaba melons, crenshaw melons, cucumbers, eggplants, endives, lettuce, pineapples, pumpkins, green beans, dried beans, <LOCATION> lima </LOCATION> beans, broccoli, <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupes, carrots, cauliflower, celery, collards, field corn, cotton, crabapples, fennel, honeydew melons, kale, kohlrabi, mustard greens, nectarines, oats, papayas, peaches, pears, pecans, peppers, rhubarb, rye, squash, spinach, turnips and watermelon

 A 26-year-old woman has a new heart, liver, and kidney after an almost daylong operation that doctors called the first of its kind. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Archbald </LOCATION> remained in critical condition today at <LOCATION> Presbyterian-University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, which is normal after transplant surgery. At a news conference this morning, doctors said they would try to begin weaning her off a respirator today. Other multiorgan transplants have been performed, but this was the first involving the heart, liver and a kidney, said transplant pioneer Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s transplant program. The procedure began at 7:35 p.m. Saturday and ended at 5 p.m. Sunday. It was Ms. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s second heart transplant. She has familial cardiomyopathy, an inherited heart disease, according to the hospital. Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s family has a history of congenital heart problems. Her father died when he was 31 and many relatives on his side of the family also have died young, her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 28, said today. Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> suffered from chronic rejection of the heart she received in her first transplant three years ago, and had developed hepatitis and kidney dysfunction. Kidney dysfunction can affect patients taking the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine. Doctors will treat Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> with the Japanese drug FK-506, which is believed 50 to 100 times more effective than cyclosporine, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> said. FK-506 has been tested since February in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> on liver, heart, kidney, pancreas and lung recipients. The new organs came from an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> woman in her 20s who was killed in a car accident, doctors said. When doctors called Saturday to say a donor had been found, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he had to scramble to locate his wife. `` We had a tough time finding her at first because she was out shopping when the call came,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` I'm nervous of course. The first transplant sort of prepared me a little for this, but I'm just nervous as to what the outcome might be.'' Her operation came five days after another milestone in transplant operations. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 21-month-old <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> became the nation's first person to receive part of a liver from a living donor. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> was listed in serious condition Sunday, and is improving steadily, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wyler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, was the donor. The world's first survivor of a heart-liver transplant was <PERSON> Stormie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, now 12, of White Settlement, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> conducted that procedure on Feb. 14, 1984, at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Two other heart-liver transplants were performed the next year in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, but both patients died with a few days of surgery. <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> also has headed multiple-organ transplant operations involving the intestines. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 3, of <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, survived six months before dying in May 1988 after a multiple-organ transplant. <LOCATION> Rolandrea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION>, 3, of <LOCATION> Fruitland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, died last January, six weeks after surgery. <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> also has headed multiple-organ transplants on adults with malignant, inoperable tumors in the pancreas and liver areas. In those cases, surgeons have removed the patient's liver, pancreas, most or all of the stomach, two-thirds of the colon, and duodenum, a 10-inch-long section of the small intestine. The cavity has been filled with a block of organs consisting of the liver, pancreas, duodenum and jejunum, a few feet of section of the small intestine.

 Hundreds of thousands of people chanting `` Resign! Resign!'' rallied in the nation's two biggest cities today to protest the new Communist-dominated government and demand a new one be named by the weekend. Waving red, white and blue national flags, a crowd in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s Wenceslas Square cheered opposition calls for a general strike Dec. 11 if there is no new government by Sunday Boos and derisive whistles greeted the mention of old <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders responsible for 21 years of hard-line policy. In the nation's second-largest city, <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, tens of thousands gathered in central Namestie Square despite the numbing cold to vent their anger. They chanted `` Resign!'' and `` Shame! Shame!'' as speaker after speaker accused Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> of ignoring the will of the people. Civic Forum, the largest opposition movement, demanded elections by July. A group spokesman, <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Maly </PERSON>, said the opposition hoped to field its own candidates. `` Thanks for your help and support,'' <PERSON> Maly </PERSON> shouted to the crowd in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. `` We need it now more than ever.'' It was the first protest in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> since Civic Forum staged a general strike a week ago. That strike, observed by millions, led <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> to agree to relinquish the Communists' 41-year monopoly on power. But the new 21-member Cabinet named Sunday contained only five non-Communists, and Communists retained all the key ministries. `` We Want a Happy Christmas, Christmas with a new government,'' read a poster near Civic Forum's <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> headquarters today. `` An old play with a new cast,'' warned another poster on the same window. The turnouts at the rallies were clear signals to the government that the opposition can still draw popular support to back its demands for democracy. `` Long live Havel!'' protesters shouted to welcome playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, the country's most prominent dissident, to Wenceslas Square. The rally was reported live on state radio and television. State radio estimated the crowd at 200,000, but Western reporters put it at about 150,000. `` We feel disappointed and cheated,'' said <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedlacek </PERSON>, a representative of striking students who decided to prolong their two-week sit-in at campuses across the country in protest of the new government. `` The government does n't understand the situation fully,'' <PERSON> Sedlacek </PERSON> told the cheering crowd. `` We want other changes.'' `` With this government, the leading role of the Communist party was assured,'' said another speaker, director <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Machocek </PERSON>. `` In fact, the leading role has been abolished in the constitution but with this government it exists again,'' he added. <PERSON> Machocek </PERSON> said artists, theaters and galleries will go on strike until Dec. 11. Actor <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Knazko </PERSON>, a key Slovak republic figure in the popular uprising, said no rally had been planned in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, `` but the government had sent us this invitation'' to demonstrate by ignoring the people. The new government appeared an attempt by the ruling Communists to buy time and get reform going at a pace they dictate, rather than the hectic tempo forced by the mass demonstrations last month. Wenceslas Square was the focal point of 11 days of mass pro-democracy demonstrations that forced a number of concessions from the Communists last week, including the promise of free elections and the removal of the party's monopoly on power. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> has so far made no specific mention of free elections. One of the concessions was the lifting of travel restrictions today. Czechoslovaks were still required, however, to have a visa from most Western countries they wished to visit, with only <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> lifting visa requirements. Border guards reported that fewer than 3,000 Czechoslovaks crossed today into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Most were just visiting, lacking enough money to stay permanently. Unlike East Germans going to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, Czechoslovaks did not receive any `` welcome money'' in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The relatively light turnout, compared with the flood that poured out of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> when its borders were opened Nov. 9, was due in part to the fact that today was a workday. Also, most Czechoslovaks do not have much hard currency, and the country's travel restrictions had not been as stringent as other East bloc countries' The opposition saw another of its demands met with the announcement on the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> that it would be given a building that had belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak-Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> to use as its <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> headquarters. Until now, Civic Forum has been operating from the striking Laterna Magika theater. The new government includes three people without party affiliation and one each from the Socialist and People's parties, which have traditionally been docile Communist allies but have become more independent in recent months. Deputy Defense Minister Col.-Gen. <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacek </PERSON> moved up to take over the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinc </PERSON>, a politically unknown Communist who last served as director of a nuclear power station, got the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> The official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency said 11 of the 17 Cabinet ministers in the Czech republic had submitted their resignations, including the unpopular ministers of education and justice.

 Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, you had mentioned that you got some insight into President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at this summit. I wonder if the insight included any sense of his internal position? Did he behave as if a man operating from a strong position, a man who seems to be in jeopardy, or how do you feel about that? A. I though he seemed very much in control, you can tell the way that he interacted with his own top people there. And he felt very confident in discussing, without notes, a wide array of subjects with me. He did have a little notebook that he referred to _ it was written in his own handwriting, the best I could see _ and _ once having seen it, I could n't read it _ and so he seemed in control. He seemed _ `` subdued'' is the wrong word, but I would say determined and unemotional about it. The most emotion we saw was at that press conference yesterday, but it was a wonderful presentation. And the climate for _ leave out the weather _ the climate for the discussions was really good. Yes, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>? Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, again as part of the insight you gained, what is your understanding about Secretary General <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s view of the unification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>? Do you think he's as opposed as he's said in public, or do you think that he accepts the fact that ... A. I think his view was one of _ if I could use a word that's unfamiliar to many _ caution, and I really believe that I think he recognizes the rapidity of change. He has very constructively talked about `` peaceful change'', and I do n't _ I think his hope is that people do n't try to set up some artificial calendar by which _ date by which that reunification should happen. And I think he feels that, if there were outside forces setting dates on something like that, that would complicate the way in which he is managing the change and helping manage the change in the Pact. Yeah? Two. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and then <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>. Q. Mr. President, there was a lot of speculation going in that you and Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might get involved in talking about deeper cuts, particularly in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> forces. Did you, in fact, do that? And is there skepticism within this organization here about moving too rapidly beyond what has now been dubbed CFE 1? A. No, we did n't get into that. We talked very broadly about our aspirations for further arms control, but there was no emphasis on that. And I _ there may be some strains in one country or another viewing the rapidity of change differently than we do. But what I suggested to our <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies is let's go forward with the agreements we've got out there _ the <ORGANIZATION> CFE </ORGANIZATION>, let's get it done. I, the President of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, will kick our bureaucracy and push it as fast as I possibly we can. I've talked to General <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. I had a meeting with him over here last night. And I'm convinced that we _ I must do more to keep it on schedule And I've encouraged the other allies to do the same I do n't think there was any resistance to that. Similarly, START and chemical weapons. So before we go into a wide array of other questions, I think the best thing to do is take advantage of the moment and move forward in those three areas. And I _ we went _ I went over that in little talks with individuals from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, as well as in the meeting itself. <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>? Q. But do you accept the principle of a CFE 2? A. Well, I'd like to get a <ORGANIZATION> CFE </ORGANIZATION> 1 in the bank first, get it locked up, get those troops out, move down to equal levels _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet forces. And so we ought to _ we ought to manage that before we start the architecure of something else. I want to see that done on time. <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President, on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as you know, the party structure, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> structure has collapsed there. It's unclear who's running the government I wonder if you talked about that, if you personally think that it's a dangerous situation, if that moves unification up in the timetable at all? And secondly, what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said to you when you said to him, unification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would have to be in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> context? A. No, I do n't think it's a dangerous situation. I do n't think anybody here in this room, including myself, has been able to predict the rapidity of the change, the totality of the change. But I do n't see it as dangerous, as long as the Soviet leader and the Germans and the West conduct themselves the way I've been _ been urging. What was the second part? Q. Well, what Mr. <PERSON> Gorabachev </PERSON> said to you when you said unification, but only in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> context? I mean, he keeps saying it has to be in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact context. A. No, we _ we _ we were _ I do n't think we went into that in real depth, <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>. Q. Well, what do you think he thinks about it? I mean, obviously. ... A. Well, that's too hypothetical. I got trouble figuring it out on our side with all our experts, rather than knowing what I think he might think about something he has n't thought about maybe. Yes, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President _ Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, you seem to have traveled some distance between what you were saying about Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a year or so ago and some of the things you said yesterday. Could you please talk in a little bit more detail about the evolution in your thinking that you mentioned yesterday, how that happened and what persuaded you along the way? A. As I watched the way in which Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has handled the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it deserves new thinking. It absolutely mandates new thinking. And when I see his willingness to give support to a <ORGANIZATION> CFE </ORGANIZATION> agreement that calls for him to disproportionately reduce his forces, and that is there on the table, I think that mandates new thinking. When I hear him talk about peaceful change and the right of countries to choose _ countries in the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> to choose _ that deserves new thinking. And so, I approach this, and I think, in step with our allies, with a certain respect for what he's doing and thus, we want to try to meet him on some of the areas where he needs help. I'm thinking of a few suggestions I had in the economic area. But I also believe that the West must remain strong and together and try to be helpful where we can in a united way, but not be imprudent. Yes, ma'am? MORE

<HEAD>Former Prison Hostage Sues to Get Videotapes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A former guard who has had emotional problems since he was held hostage during a 1987 riot at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> federal prison is suing to get government videotapes his psychologist says can help him end his ordeal. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mormann </PERSON>, 36, was one of about 100 hostages held by Cuban detainees during the 11-day takeover at the penitentiary two years ago. A number of people held hostage at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> prison and during a related prison confrontation at <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, have reported serious emotional problems. Soon after his release, <PERSON> Mormann </PERSON> accepted a transfer to a prison in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, where the mostly Hispanic prison population reminded him of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> prison. `` I flipped out,'' he said, adding that he suffered a panic attack that put him in a psychiatric ward for a month. His wife and daughter left him, and he has since divorced. He returned to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July 1988 and lives on worker's compensation. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> confirms that tapes of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> riot exist, but has told <ORGANIZATION> Mormann </ORGANIZATION> he was not specific enough as to which ones he wished to see when he tried to get copies through the Freedom of Information Act. He sued in federal court when that effort failed. `` How can we be more specific? We do n't even know what's on the tapes,'' said psychologist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jonesboro </LOCATION>, who has been treating Mormann for a year. `` It's not like there's a national security risk here. ... We're just looking for anything that can bring him back into the situation.'' <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said the tapes could help <PERSON> Mormann </PERSON> realize what he went through and help him get on with his life. `` He can watch the tapes and be anxious, cut it off and go back to it when he calms down. Control is the key,'' <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mormann </PERSON> has post-traumatic stress disorder, similar to that of some war or disaster survivors, and suffers nightmares and flashbacks. On the day of the Nov. 23, 1987, takeover, <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> was the only guard in a dormitory of about 70 Cubans considered to be model prisoners. He locked himself in an office, but the inmates broke the door down with a desk. He was handcuffed, tied and forced at knifepoint to be a human shield for the transfer of two wounded prisoners. He was kept handcuffed to another guard in a cell for the duration of the takeover. The Cubans detained at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> prison were among those who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the Mariel boatlift of 1980. Thousands who had criminal records or got into trouble after arrival were held pending deportation. Since the riot, 122 have been sent back to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, 789 remain in custody and 3,250 have been released to halfway houses, relatives or other sponsors.

 A police specialist took the witness stand today at the murder and drunken driving trial of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> to begin a detailed reconstruction of a fiery bus crash that killed 27 people. State Trooper <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cease </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an accident reconstruction specialist, described his investigation of the May 14, 1988, collision between the crowded bus and a small pickup <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is alleged to have been driving the wrong way on Interstate 71 south of <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>. Cease spent 1,880 hours investigating the wreck. Also testifying this morning was State Police Detective <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON>, who tried to determine where <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> had been on the day of the crash. He said he could account for <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s whereabouts for all but one hour and five minutes before the crash. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 36, of rural <LOCATION> Owen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton endangerment, 12 counts of assault and a count of drunken driving. So far in the trial, which began with jury selection on Nov. 8, the jury has seen the charred remains of the church bus, visited the accident scene, heard from people who said they were nearly run off the road by <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> and heard accounts from rescue workers and police officers who went to the crash. Last week, 39 of the 40 survivors described in detail the panic and horror they felt while they scrambled to escape from the burning bus. Several survivors testified they tried in vain to kick out windows. Some escaped the flames by diving over a pile of bodies at the rear emergency exit. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the special prosecutor, said he also intends to call relatives of the 24 children and three adults killed in the crash. He said the prosecution could rest its case later this week but was not specific. Defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said he has n't decided yet whether <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> will testify.

<TEXT>
 Paint was splashed on doors of four <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches, and a group claiming responsibility said the vandalism was retaliation for Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>'s opposition to the use of condoms to prevent AIDS. Members of a group calling itself Greater Religious Responsibility! claimed Sunday they had defaced the places of worship with bright red paint, a color they said symbolizes the blood of AIDS patients. Posters of <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> were glued to the church entrances with paraphrased excerpts from his recent policy statement such as, `` Safe sex is both a lie and a fraud.'' Calls seeking comment went unanswered at the archbishop's office and residence this morning. At <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambrose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, vandals scrawled the word `` murderer'' beneath a photo of the archbishop, said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beattie </PERSON>. A caller to <ORGANIZATION> KNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> who said she was a member of the activist group said the vandalism will continue until <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> changes his anti-condom stance. Another caller told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> the paint also denoted the tragedy of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. `` Someone dies of AIDS every 20 minutes in this country because -LRB- <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>'s -RRB- policy is allowing that to continue unchecked,'' the woman caller said. <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> was chairman of a committee at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Bishops that rejected the use of condoms as a means of fighting the spread of AIDS. In presenting the policy paper to the bishops, <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> declared that young people should avoid `` being trapped into the ` safe-sex' myth, which is both a lie and a fraud. <PERSON> Beattie </PERSON>, who said at least 30 percent of his congregation is gay, said he was saddened by the act of vandalism and believed the archbishop's policy has been misinterpreted. `` St. <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> has done a lot to reach out to the gay community, and why we should be singled out is a matter of confusion,'' he said. `` The tenor of the archbishop's statement is one of compassion for those with AIDS and of compassion for gays and lesbians.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pop stars finished a new version of the 1984 hit song `` Do They Know It's Christmas?'' early Monday to raise money for African famine victims. More than a dozen singers ranging from Australian teen idol <PERSON> Kylie </PERSON> <PERSON> Minogue </PERSON> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veteran <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> worked into the early hours to remake the Band Aid song that topped the charts in Christmas 1984, organizers said. The single is expected to go on sale Dec. 11. The original record raised some $ 10 million for starving Africans and spawned other projects including the transatlantic Live Aid rock extravaganza on July 13, 1985 which brought in more than $ 100 million. Millionaire pop-record producer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON>, who supervised production of the new single at his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> studios, said he was considering organizing Live Aid II next year. `` First we have to bring the public's attention to the record, then we will sit down just after Christmas and talk about a live show,'' he said. `` It would be perfect timing.'' <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON> lined up the pop stars and groups, including <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rea </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bananarama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bros </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> and Tears for Fears, after being approached by <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> rock singer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON> last week. <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON>, who conceived the 1984 single, said he is keeping a backstage role. `` The problem -LRB- in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -RRB- is the same, the song is the same, and it's the same time of year,'' <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON> said. `` The only thing that has changed is the faces in English pop music.'' British aid workers recently back from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> said Monday that scores of villagers in the war-ravaged northern province of <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> are dying of hunger. They urged Britons to dig into their pockets to help avert a famine disaster. `` There is still time,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> of Christian Aid. `` We have about until the end of January before absolute crisis hits us.'' Up to 4 million people in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> are threatened with starvation, aid agencies say.

<HEAD>Kibbutz Movement Accepts Bailout Plan for $3.6 Billion Debt</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s financially strapped collective farm movement agreed to an austerity program including meatless meals and fewer trips abroad under a government bailout of its $ 3.6 billion debt, a spokesman said Monday. The collective farms, a symbol of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s socialist pioneers, also agreed to increase investment in light industry, said <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Helman </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kibbutz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's part of a trend,'' he said. `` We already produce far more than the agricultural needs of the state, so we are looking for profitable exports, like winter fruit and flowers to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and light industry.'' Kibbutzes were founded at the turn of the century by <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> immigrants who believed hard work on collective farms would build a unique Israeli character. But the movement's debts and aging population have forced kibbutzes to invest in light industry, which accounts for half of their profits. The movement also agreed to sell $ 20 million in assets, including property in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, and ordered member farms to serve two meatless meals a week as part of a 7 percent cutback in living expenses, <PERSON> Helman </PERSON> said. Under the agreement, to be signed this week, the government will write off $ 835 million in debts. It will offer tax breaks to banks to give the collective farms 25-year loans at 4.5 percent interest to cover the remainder of the total debt. The plan was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kibbutz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. The smaller <PERSON> Kibbutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Artzi </PERSON> movement accepted the program three weeks ago. `` There was a tremendous amount of disagreement over whether to accept the government offer,'' <PERSON> Helman </PERSON> said. `` It does not address our future, the building of new kibbutzes, the absorption of new immigrants or our pension plan.'' <PERSON> Helman </PERSON> said many kibbutz members blamed the government for creating the unfavorable exchange rates and high interest rates that devastated kibbutz exports and helped cause the huge debt. Newspaper reports said Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, put pressure on the movement to accept the offer. The movment's 164 collective farms are affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, while the <PERSON> Kibbutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Artzi </PERSON> movement's 84 collective farms are linked to the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Mapam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The two groups have 110,000 members. Some members said they voted for the plan, which passed by a 300-32 vote, out of fear kibbutzes could fall under control of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc in the future. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has accused kibbutzes of financial mismanagement and threatened to cut off aid. But <PERSON> Helman </PERSON> said he believed <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> also would agree to a bail-out plan because of the food raised by the kibbutzes and the location of many of them along <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s borders.

 A Czechoslavak journal associated with the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> opposition was awarded an operating grant Monday from a group of Western press associations that have established a new project to assist East Bloc media. A $ 10,000 grant was awarded to the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> journal <ORGANIZATION> Lidove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noviny </ORGANIZATION> to assure two more months of publication, the press associations said. Lidove Noviny, which is almost a century old, reappeared two years ago as an underground journal of the Charter 77 human rights movement and recently received official authorization to publish.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poland </ORGANIZATION> devalued the Polish zloty by 9.5 percent Monday, continuing a drive to create a convertible currency that would encourage Western economic investment. The new rate is 4,200 zlotys to the dollar, compared with 3,800 a week ago. The zloty was devalued similarly against other Western currencies. The devaluation was the eighth since Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> took office in August as the first non-communist leader in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and initiated a radical reformation of the staggering Polish economy. Like other currencies in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, the zloty can not be freely exchanged with the hard currencies of the West and has a value set by the government, not the money market. Poles can legally buy dollars at a less favorable but more realistic market-driven exchange, known as the `` commercial'' rate, at about 7,000 zlotys to the dollar. The government seeks to make the official and commercial rates converge, possibly as soon as Jan. 1, giving the zloty a convertible value that would ensure Western companies a way to translate profits into other currencies.

 A 22-year tradition of father-son banquets honoring the high school football team was canceled this year after the quarterback said he would n't go if his mother could n't. `` A lot of people supporting us through hard times were mothers, but they could n't come to our banquet,'' said <PERSON> Owa </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandstein </PERSON>, quarterback for the team at <ORGANIZATION> Mohawk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's blatant discrimination.

 <LOCATION> BRUSSELS </LOCATION>: yes, ma'am?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, you mentioned earlier that there was some tension during the meetings and earlier, to reporters you had said that there was no personal rancor. Could you outline the moments of tension or tell us a little bit about the moments when you felt there was tension between you and the Soviet leader? A. Yeah, I think where you do n't have agreement, you can have some _ some slight tension might result. I do n't want to imply there was great and dramatic moments of tension. Please, if I _ let me clarify it if that's the impression I left. But we have a big difference on how we look at Central America. And I would like to see him use his influence with Mr. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, and if he's got any left, with Mr. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, to facilitate democratic change in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. And I make clear, this is n't just the view of the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but it's the view of many Americans and it's the view of <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. So when you get into a subject like that, where he may have a different formula, it's a little more concentrated than when you're clicking off agreements in some areas. Is there anybody here from a _ that's not accredited to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, only because I do n't want to be rude to the foreign journalists? You're not a foreign journalist. Q. -LRB- Inaudible -RRB-. A. Who? Q. -LRB- Inaudible -RRB-. A. You are. I was n't talking to you. I was talking to him. Go ahead, please. Q. Could I ask you to elaborate a little more on what you mean by <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> integration _ greater <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> integration? A. What? Q. You made a statement before _ in your statement, you referred to European Community _ <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> _ greater <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> integration. A. Well, what I'm talking about is primarily on the economic side. You're going to have enormous interchange between the East and West. And what we're trying to do in the West and I think the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> is trying to do it also, is to assist those countries that are moving down the democratic path. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> was charged out of our <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to move forward on a coordinated economic approach to help <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. And so it's in that area where I see the earliest and the most productive integration. Way to the back on the aisle. Sir? Q. Mr. President, in the last two weeks of June, Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> for the summit. The very beginning of July the G-7 will be meeting in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Now you said in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> that you wanted to help steward or to help steer the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the global economy. Is there a prospect that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might stay on for the G-7 summit, or _ -LRB- inaudible -RRB- _ that summit, why do n't you include some of the Eastern -LRB- inaudible -RRB- A. The answer is, I do n't think so. Put it this way, two chances: slim and none for that _ for that particular meeting. Nor did he request to be included in that particular meeting. But we're in times of rapid change and we'll see how things move forward in terms of having a common subject to discuss You see, we've got to _ got to understand his dilemma. They have not had a market economy, they have not had the privatization that is _ that joins the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> together. It's different. And so what I have proposed, and as opposed to the suggestion _ the question you ask, is that we work with them in observer status in the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> eventually, as soon as the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round is over. Do more for him to do more with <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION>. It is important that not just the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but other countries in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> understand the market economies, understand the dynamism of the economic systems that join those seven countries. So I do n't think it's likely that, you know, that he would hang around <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> waiting for the next meeting. Yeah, <PERSON> Robby </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President, you stepped aside on a question about the `` peace dividend'' and said that you've got a terrible Gramm-Rudman problem next year. As you look at the changes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the possibilities of further defense cuts, do you expect any time in your first term to have a dividend, a `` peace dividend'' to apply to some of the economic and social problems at home? And when would you expect that? A. That's an awful tough question to answer about anytime. I would think it would be extraordinarily difficult because of the _ of the _ not only the enormity of the Gramm-Rudman _ the difficulty of reaching the Gramm-Rudman target this year, but what follows on. And so what we are trying to do is emphasize the areas where we can be of most help to the people through various programs. And I _ in some areas _ I do n't know whether <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> mentioned in her question, education _ but in some areas it is n't necessarily _ the problem is n't going to be solved by putting more money into it. But on your question, as we go on down on the _ on meeting these Gramm-Rudman targets, there just is n't a lot of, quote `` excess money,'' unquote, floating around there. Q. Not for the foreseeable future, not for the rest of your first term? A. Well, look at the Gramm-Rudman targets that face us. I do n't want to hold out to those that want to rush out and spend a lot more money the hope that that is going to happen We've got some tremendous economic problems that have to be solved. Because the best answer to helping people, if you have to divide it _ have to quantify it, the best is to have a job. And the best way to have the climate for a job is to have a sound economy. And to our foreign friends here, I'd say one of the things that would be the best guarantee of that would be to get our federal deficits down. It would also help us with investment. And that is the best poverty program _ a job in the private sector. And so I ca n't _ I do n't _ I had a letter from a distinguished senator before I left, because he had read about possible defense cuts, a reduction in the defense budget, saying take that money and spend it for a cause that he felt was very worthy. And I had to write him back and say, `` Look, that is n't the way it's going to work.'' That is n't the way it's going to work Yes? Q. Mr. President, you spoke in your opening statement about the need for a greater role for the 35 nation group known as <ORGANIZATION> CSCE </ORGANIZATION>. You know that in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> raised the possibility of a new conference, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. I understand that did n't come up in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. A. No, it did n't. Q. It did? A. No, it did not, you're right. MORE

<HEAD>Thatcher Faces First Leadership Challenge in 14 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> faces re-election as <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader Tuesday, and for the first time since she got the job 14 years ago, she has a challenger. Sir <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, a rank-and-file legislator little known outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, does n't expect to win. But he hopes to get enough votes to send Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> a message of discontent at a time of 7.3 percent inflation and difficulties over <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s place in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said Monday that out of the 374 Conservative members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> eligible to cast ballots, he expected up to 20 will vote for <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> Some are expected to abstain in a show of disapproval of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s sometimes autocratic leadership style, and her reluctance to accept some of the new rules dictated by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s membership in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> says estimates of anti-Thatcher votes and abstentions range from 23 to 66, with an average prediction of 45. Forty-five would do Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> little harm. Analysts agree it would take 100 or more to wound her, and no one expects her to lose outright. Early guesses are tricky, because many members have refused to state their preference before they put their votes in the ballot box. The waverers face a dilemma: they want to send her a message, but not such an overwhelming one that she will feel obliged to resign. Conservative lawmakers vote annually on their leader, and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, 64, has been endorsed without opposition since 1975 when she ousted former Prime Minister <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>. She has led the Conservative to three successive election victories since 1979, become the longest-serving <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister this century, and said she wants to go on and on. But public opinion polls show she is the least popular prime minister this century, her <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> are up to 15 points behind the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and her sweeping economic and social reforms have gone too far for many voters. `` While the rich have become richer in the past 10 years, the poor have become poorer,'' said <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, a 69-year-old former diplomat who represents a Welsh constituency and has always been on the liberal anti-Thatcher wing of the party. `` There is a real limit on the extent to which the electorate is prepared to tolerate public squalor, whether in filthy streets, worsening public transport or inadequate schools or hospitals in return for private affluence,'' he said Monday. Younger said in a weekend television interview that <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> wrongly believes `` there is a vast groundswell who want him to do this. I'm afraid the truth is there is n't and people mostly would very much wish he had n't.'' To be reelected on the first ballot, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> needs 57 percent of the 374 eligible votes _ a majority plus 15 percent. If she fails, up to two more ballots can be held until a winner emerges on a simply majority of 188 votes. The victor becomes party leader and prime minister, subject only to the formality of royal approval. The Conservatives hold 375 of the 650 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, but Speaker <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON> does not vote. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has a vote, said last week the leadership vote was bad for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and for the party, but she defended <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>'s democratic right to challenge her. Opinion polls consistently have named another former <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON>, as the person voters would most like to replace Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> has said he mounted the challenge not in any hope of winning, but as a way of enticing more likely candidates into the race. However <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> has repeatedly said he wo n't participate in the campaign to unseat Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, although he has not indicated whether he will cast a ballot or abstain Tuesday.

 Q. But even though it did n't, it's an important suggestion, and I wonder how you feel about it. A. Well, I feel about it that I have a _ with respect to him, an even more important suggestion. And that is that we sign a CFE agreement. There's something that's very practical, that's very much within our grasp. And I think that should be our prime objective for that kind of a meeting. Yeah, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>? Q. Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said yesterday that you and he agreed in your talks that the world _ that the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting marked the end of the epoch of the Cold War and entering a new period. Do you agree with him that the Cold War is over? <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, let me tell you something. -LRB- Laughter -RRB-. We're fooling with semantics here.

I am from <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. A. -LRB- Laughs -RRB-. _ named `` <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON>.'' Go ahead. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Q. Mr. President, what is your reaction to Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact should not remain yet military alliances, but rather become military-political alliances, and later on just political alliances Can you envisage in the future any form of cooperation between the two alliances?

And I hope that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will, along with the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> and along with <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> and these other areas, will take more of an active East-West role in the economy, in helping each other in terms of systems. But he did not press that point with me at all. I think he envisions an active <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, in one way or another. <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON>, yes? Q. Mr. President, after five hours of talks on Saturday, despite extremely treacherous seas, and you even had trouble getting to the talks, you got back in your launch and went back to your ship. Mr. President, why did you do that? And. ... A. Because I wanted to go back in time to receive him for dinner. Q. Did n't you understand you were risking the summit, number one? And number two, what do you think <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> thinks of your judgment? <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON>, you've been to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Do n't tell me that that little chop was _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ was risking anything. Frankly, I have n't had that much fun in a long time, either But the fact that we got out there and the seas kicked up even more _ the winds were up to 60 knots _ that's a big _ 60 miles an hour, 50 knots, which is a big wind, and along with it came a swell, and along with it came a chop. But we did n't miss a beat. In fact, we had a very relaxed evening out there, and then showed up and we got eight hours of talks in. So it was a _ that was a non-issue, and I did n't feel there was any risk in getting into a little safe launch like that and going back out to the ship. It was sheer pleasure, really. Q. And it was hot-dogging? A. Hot-dogging? No. -LRB- Laughter -RRB-. Well, you know, these charismatic, macho, visionary guys _ they'll do anything. -LRB- Laughter -RRB-. Yeah. This is the last question. I've got to go. I've got to go home. Q. Mr. President, a few moments ago, you questioned whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had any influence at all over <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. Yet in his news conference yesterday, Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> indicated that there may be an opportunity now for peace in the region. Did he indicate to you in any way whether, one, he had any control over Ortega, or, two, whether there was something in the works that may lead to some kind of peaceful political. ... A. No, he did n't, but I think _ he did n't indicate whether he had any control over him. What he did indicate was that there were going to be free elections. And I told him, that's fine _ to have those free elections _ but they've got to be fair. You have to have access from _ for the minorities to _ minority parties and the opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>, to get in there and participate _ a full access. And so we had a little discussion of that. But that was about it. Q. To follow up, if he indicated there would be free elections, that in turn would indicate that he does in fact maintain some sort of influence on <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. And then would n't you hold him further responsible to stop that flow of arms in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>? A. Well, I'm not sure that _ I do n't see quite the logic, that if he says there's going to be a free election that means he controls them. I'm unclear on your. ... Q. How could he _ how could he assure you that there would be free elections? A. I do n't _ oh, excuse me _ I do n't think he assured me there was. He just says free elections are scheduled. And I told him how important we felt it was that they go forward. I am told that our congressional delegation, made up of some who've been rather generous in their comments about what the Sandinistas were about, or at least were less than supportive historically for the Contras, were on this delegation, and that the delegation was denied the right to come in and take a look. And I told him this is counterproductive. This does n't help. And so _ but I do n't want to imply from that, that he can _ he can just snap his fingers and have Mr. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> _ I think he was _ do what he I think he was impressed _ I may be wrong, but I _ I think he was impressed by the message from <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> And I asked <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> if it was okay to tell him of the call, and he said, yes, I hope you will. So when I said this man, this Nobel Prize winner _ prize winner down there _ who _ with whom we've had some differences, though normally we're in pretty good sync _ appeals to you, `` Use your influence to, you know, stop the export of revolution,'' it may have made an impact. I really do have to run. It's supposed to be out of here at, for those who are flying with us, at quarter of, and it's now fourteen of. No, wait a minute _ twelve of. What's the big hand here? I'm getting a little tired -LRB- Audience laughter. -RRB- Thank you. END OF TEXT

<HEAD>Court Will Study Government's Power to Fine Polluters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will decide whether the federal government's delays in setting clean-air guidelines limit its power to fine polluters. The justices said they will hear an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, which faces fines of up to $ 25,000 a day for violating air-quality standards at a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> car-assembly plant. A lower court rejected <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s claims that it should be shielded from fines because of federal delays on proposed revisions in state pollution controls. The public should not be penalized with dirtier air because of what often are unavoidable delays by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled. In other action, the court: _ Agreed to consider limiting the federal government's power to control water used by hydroelectric dams The court said it will hear a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> appeal supported by more than 40 states. _ Refused to enhance the power of states and their citizens to block shipments of hazardous waste from other states The court rejected an appeal by <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> officials who failed to prevent shipments of hazardous waste from an abandoned <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> chemical refinery. _ Agreed to decide whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks with branch offices overseas must pay depositors after foreign governments seize or freeze those accounts The court will review a ruling that required <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> to pay depositors. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nomination was defeated by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, is representing <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>. _ Left intact a victory for rock star Prince by refusing to revive a copyright-infringement claim by his half-sister over the hit song `` U Got The Look. The air-pollution case involves a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and focuses on the joint federal-state system for cleaning up the atmosphere. Under the federal Clean Air Act, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> sets national air quality standards and states must adopt plans to meet those standards. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 approved a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> plan for reducing pollution from paint at auto-assembly factories. The plan required car makers to comply fully with the federal rules by Dec. 31, 1985. But <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials extended the deadline for any plant switching from lacquer to enamel paints, which emit less pollutants. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> initially planned to stay with lacquer at the <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> factory but in June 1985 announced it would convert to enamel paint by the summer of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> asked that it not be required to comply with the Dec. 31, 1985, standards until 20 months later. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> officials approved <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal and submitted a revised plan to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 30, 1985. Without waiting for federal approval, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> began building a $ 200 million plant in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> to use enamel-based paints while continuing to operate its existing factory. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials went to federal court in August 1987 seeking fines of up to $ 25,000 a day against <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for 20 months of air-quality violations at the old plant. But it was not until September 1988 that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> rejected the state-approved pollution-control system at the new plant. A federal judge barred the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> from fining <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for violations of the Dec. 31, 1985, standards, ruling that the federal agency itself violated the Clean Air Act by taking more than four months to rule on the state-approved plan submitted Dec. 30, 1985. But the 1st Circuit court last June said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to meet the four-month deadline does not disqualify it from fining companies that violate previously approved pollution-control rules. The appeals court told the trial judge to decide how much the fines should be, advising him to consider whether the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s delay was reasonable and what impact the delay had on <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> joined <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> in urging the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review the dispute. <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the 1st Circuit court ruling invites unfair treatment for businesses. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said the 1st Circuit court ruling was correct.

<TEXT>
 The trial of two dissidents who illegally visited communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> erupted in a melee Monday with their supporters shouting anti-government slogans and scuffling with courtroom guards. About 50 people were expelled from a courthouse after they shouted slogans and greeted the two dissidents by showering them with confetti and paper airplanes. Radical student leader <PERSON> Im </PERSON> <PERSON> Su-kyong </PERSON> and dissident <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyu-hyon </PERSON> stood impassively as screaming supporters, friends and relatives were forced from the courtroom by guards. `` Repeal National Security Law!'' protesters shouted, raising clenched fists as they were taken away. Some protesters traded punches with guards as they were hauled from the courtroom kicking and screaming. The incident began as soon as the two defendants were led into the courtroom for the third day of hearings in their trial. About 200 supporters, many of them students, shouted slogans demanding their release. Senior judge <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-hyon </PERSON> adjourned the hearing and ordered about 40 people expelled. Another 10 were ordered out when they protested, shouting slogans and insults. Outside the courthouse, police arrested 21 people, mostly college students, for either demonstrating in support of the two dissidents or trying to carry confetti into the courtroom. Miss Im and <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> were charged with making illegal trips to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. If convicted, they could be sentenced to as many as 10 years in prison under the National Security Law. Miss Im, a 20-year-old junior majoring in French at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, traveled to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> without government authorization to attend a July 1-8 world youth festival <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, a U.S.-educated clergyman, was sent to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by a group of dissident <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priests to escort Miss Im home. Both were arrested upon returning to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> through the border village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> Aug. 15. Both claimed their trips were intended to help reunite the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, divided in 1945. But prosecutors have presented evidence showing the pair making speeches in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, criticizing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The two called <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` a colony of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. imperialists.'' In a separate trial Monday, a criminal court sentenced the Rev. <PERSON> Nam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuk-hyon </PERSON>, a dissident <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest, to two years' imprisonment, suspended for three years, for playing a leading role in sending Moon to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>

 Red Cross officials from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> met Monday but failed to agree on terms for exchanging separated family members before the end of the year, reports said. Both sides agreed to continue discussing possible family visits through a telephone hotline linking <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, the two <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capitals, according to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been trying to arrange a four-day exchange of families that would be only the second such exchange in four decades. The Korean peninsula was divided at the end of World War II. About 10 million family members were separated by the 1945 division of their land and the Korean War. Monday's 50-minute meeting was the seventh since September and was called by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. It was the first closed-door session and foreign press was barred. Ten Korean news reporters were invited to cover the talks. The two nations initially agreed to exchange more than 500 separated family members and entertainers for a four-day visit starting Dec. 8, but talks broke down when <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> insisted on broadcasting a three-hour revolutionary opera written by North Korean leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> on South Korean TV. South Korean officials rejected the demand as a propaganda ploy. Yonhap quoted chief South Korean delegate <PERSON> Song </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-dae </PERSON> as saying after Monday's meeting that both sides confirmed it would be impossible to exchange family members before the end of this year. Song urged <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to cooperate to carry out the family exchange early next year, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. The chief North Korean delegate, <PERSON> Pak </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong </PERSON> <PERSON> Su </PERSON>, left the conference room without answering questions by reporters, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Security agents stood guard today outside the offices of former disgraced <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders to safeguard documents and other evidence that could be used in investigations of high-level corruption. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwanitz </PERSON>, the national security chief, barred all flights to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> following reports that sensitive material was being smuggled out of the country to the hard-line <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally. Members of the largest opposition group demanded a referendum on German reunification and urged the government to allow quick free elections. One spokesman said <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders had `` lost all legitimacy.'' Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, a Communist reformer, emerged as the country's No. 1 political leader after the entire party leadership resigned in disgrace Sunday and left a 25-member committee in control of the government. Protests continued despite the resignations. `` We do n't need any Politburo and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that is made up of criminals!'' one woman screamed at a rally of about 10,000 people Sunday night in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> `` This should have happened long ago!'' a man shouted. The official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said security agents were stationed outside party offices in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to prevent former members of the Politburo and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from gaining access to documents in file cabinets and safes. Agents also stood guard outside official guest houses following growing public resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the former leadership, it said. The security measures were aimed at keeping valuables and possibly documents that might be used as evidence from being removed. Several former leaders have been accused in a growing corruption investigation of abusing their powers and stealing money from the state. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, the 61-year-old reformer and former <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> party chief, led <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s delegation at the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact summit that began in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported. Also attending the summit were Foreign Minister <PERSON> Oskar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, who resigned as party chief Sunday along with the party's 10-member ruling Politburo and its entire 163-member Central Committee. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> went to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting in the largely ceremonial role of head of state. ADN mentioned no further role for him. Just two months ago, the party's hierarchy enforced iron-fisted rule. Now, the former ruling elite has its back against the wall as demands grow for punishment of those who lived in style while <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> sank into crisis. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, elected premier Nov. 13 by a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that broke with the discredited Communists, now appears in charge of day-to-day affairs, and official newspapers predicted an imminent split in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Public resentment of the ruling Communists has reached a fever pitch and <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> is seen as more acceptable than the ousted authoritarian leadership that long shunned him. Many of the party's rank-and-file are disgusted with the high life the ousted elite is reported to have enjoyed. In Sunday's housecleaning, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor as party leader, and 11 other members of the hard-line Old Guard were expelled from the party; three former Politburo members were arrested on corruption charges; and the country's chief of trade with the West fled. The pressure on the party increased today, with the opposition group <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> demanding a law allowing quick free elections. The group, with 200,000 members, also urged a national referendum to decide on German reunification. There have been growing calls to reunite the two Germanys, but New Forum previously had warned against such suggestions. A statement signed by New Forum leaders <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheidig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christiane </PERSON> <PERSON> Paetzold </PERSON> said the long-term possibility of one German state within present borders of the two countries was `` no longer an unthinkable utopia.'' The statement urged all New Forum organizations to press for a quick a referendum to find out `` what the real wish of the people'' was on the issue of reunification. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> claims that most East Germans want reunification, but there have been no opinion polls or other indications of how East Germans feel about the issue. Among the reformers named Sunday to the new 25-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> committee are <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> and the country's former spy chief, <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. A spokesman for the committee, <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, said its immediate task would be to investigate corruption among the discredited Communist elite. The committee will effectively rule as the party prepares for a special congress on Dec. 15, when it is expected to choose new leaders. Several hundred thousand people joined hands to form `` human chains'' in sections across the country Sunday and displayed signs calling for the removal of the `` Central Committee mafia'' and imprisonment for ex-party `` criminals.'' The party that has ruled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for all its 40 years has already abolished its guaranteed monopoly on power and promised free elections for as early as next year. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> was not named to the new reform committee. His was the shortest reign of any East German leader. Responding to massive protest demonstrations, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> opened the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9 and promised reforms including free elections, but calls increased for his removal because of his past links to <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s rule. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON>, among those ousted from the Politburo, said the 12 expelled Sunday were suspected of `` serious violations of party statutes.'' Among those thrown out were ex-Premier <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON>.

 More than 100 people were arrested this morning for blockading a federal building to protest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, police said. All 112 were given summonses for disorderly conduct and two also were charged with resisting arrest, said Officer <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Swinney </PERSON>, a police spokeswoman.

About 250 people, including <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nuns and other clergy members, then moved to the main entrance to the building and began a blockade about 8 a.m., he said.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the four other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations that invaded <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968 to crush a reform movement today condemned the action. The statement came as East bloc leaders, including the first non-communist head of state, met for a <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> meeting to hear President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s report on his recent talks with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The leaders of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> said the entrance of their troops into <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> 21 years ago constitituted `` interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and must be condemned.'' `` Interrupting the process of democratic renewal in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, these unjustified actions had long-term negative consequences,'' added the statement, which was read on the evening news and carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The Soviet-led invasion crushed the `` Prague Spring'' reforms of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who was subsequently ousted as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. He has since re-emerged as one of the spokespeople of the pro-democracy movement sweeping <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> briefing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders on the summit. Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the allies he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed `` to propose to their allies ... a meeting of government leaders at the signing of an agreement on conventional disarmament.'' The leaders meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> included <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> president, and <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, who resigned as his country's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief Sunday along with the rest of the Politburo but retained the ceremonial post of president. The East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> headed the nation's delegation. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not mention the arrival of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the first non-communist East bloc leader to attend a <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> meeting since the alliance was created in 1955 in response to the formation of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s participation highlights the radical changes that have occurred recently in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would tell the allies of his weekend talks in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but it did not say when the Soviet leader would address the meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> announced earlier that Western journalists would not be accredited for the meeting and said they would have to depend on state-run Soviet media for reports. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact last held a meeting in July in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Since then, there have been dramatic political changes in many of the member countries and calls for reforms within the pact itself. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germay </LOCATION>'s longtime leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was ousted Oct. 18 after thousands of citizens fled to the West and others staged mass protests for reforms. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> replaced <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, and on Nov. 9 his government bowed to continued pressure and opened <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders to allow people to travel freely It also was the first <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact meeting for <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> replaced ousted Bulgarian party chief <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> on Nov. 10, and <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> replaced Czechoslovak leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> on Nov. 24. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> fell after similar pro-democracy demonstrations in their countries, and their replacements pledged reforms. The official Bulgarian news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> would stay on in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact summit on a visit at the invitation of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, official Romanian media reported that President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> headed his nation's delegation to the meeting. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has rejected calls for reform.

<HEAD>New-Home Sales Off But Analysts Predict Some Improvement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Sales of new homes fell 0.5 percent in October, the government reported Monday. Analysts said overall purchases were driven down by a 24.7 percent decline in the West due to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay-area </LOCATION> earthquake and the effects of the slowing economy. But economists said the sales pace should improve somewhat over the next few months as mortgage interest rates drop to the mid-9 percent range. No analyst predicted a surge in sales. `` The report says that housing market activity has improved some from the sluggish pace of March and February, but that the market is by no means taking off,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, senior economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 649,000 in October following a revised 10.2 percent plunge in September. September sales originally were reported down 14 percent. Sales in the West fell 53,000 units on an annual basis to 161,000 homes. But all other regions posted gains, prompting <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, to conclude `` the earthquake appeared to keep people from buying new homes.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carliner </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, said economic sluggishness also contributed to the lack of western sales. Part of the problem, he said, was slower defense spending, which resulted in significant layoffs. Home sales had fallen dramatically earlier this year as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> pumped up interest rates to slow the economy and thus contain inflation. As inflationary pressures cooled, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has permitted gradual decreases in rates since the beginning of the summer. Fixed-rate mortgage interest rates fell to an average of 9.82 percent by the end of October after rising into the double digits in September, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the lower interest rates, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemira </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said `` the new home market appears to be hurt by the ever-widening gap between new and existing home prices. `` Builders also appear to be misreading the current market,'' he said. `` It is a market for low-priced homes and builders generally are not building for that market.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the median price of a new home in October rose 5.3 percent to $ 127,900. The median means half of the homes cost more and half less. The average price of a new home was unchanged at $ 151,900. On the other hand, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that the median price of an existing single-family home was $ 92,100. New home sales in the Northeast rose 47.8 percent but <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> said that reflected a low September sales count rather than growing market strength in the area. The South posted a 5.7 percent increase, while the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> recorded a 3.7 percent gain. New-home sales for the first nine months were down 4.4 percent from the same period in 1988. In its report, the real estate trade group said that its index measuring the ability of the typical American family to buy an existing home rose in October to its highest level in eight months because of stable mortgage rates and a drop in the median home price. The real estate group said the index rose to 106.1, from 103.5 in September and was the highest since it was 106.7 last February. That means a family with a median income of $ 33,365 had 106.1 percent of the income needed to buy a median-priced existing home costing $ 92,100.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday his meeting with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gave the two leaders a chance to cement a personal relationship, though `` it was n't all sweetness and light.'' In a news conference before leaving <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ after briefing the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies on his summit talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summed up his own new relationship with the Soviet president, forged in the stormy waters off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> during their weekend of talks aboard a Soviet cruise ship. `` What happened was, I think he took my measure and I took his, and I think we just feel more comfortable about our common objectives,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He hedged a bit when asked if he considered the Soviet leader a personal friend. That they had `` friendly conversations,'' was as far as he would go. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made clear that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had made an impression on him. `` I feel I can sense much more clearly the things he feels more strongly about. And we had a good chance to point out to him some of the difficulties with our relationship. It was n't all sweetness and light,'' said the president. In their private sessions aboard the Maxim Gorky, anchored firmly to harbor against the harsh December storm, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was less openly emotional than when he presided buoyantly with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sunday over the first joint news conference for Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leaders. In public, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> felt free to joke about his summit partner, talking of the importance of `` cautiousness _ and I use the favorite word by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also praised the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting enthusiastically, saying it had placed his relationship with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` on a different level.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` As I watched the way in which Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has handled the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it deserves new thinking. It absolutely mandates new thinking.'' Noting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s willingness to consider disproportionate troop withdrawals from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and his support for peaceful change and a right of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries to make their own choices, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he and the Western allies feel `` a certain respect for what he's doing and thus, we want to try to meet him on some of the areas where he needs help.'' In the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> talks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` He seemed very much in control. You can tell the way that he interacted with his own top people there. He felt very confident in discussing without notes a wide array of subjects with me.'' `` He seemed _ ` subdued' is the wrong word, but I would say determined and unemotional about it. The most emotion we saw was at that press conference yesterday, but it was a wonderful presentation,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The two leaders did n't resolve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grievances over the actions of Soviet-backed governments and rebels in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but even there <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sounded a more conciliatory note than he had before. He spoke at length of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s support for free elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and said he felt the Soviet leader was `` impressed by the message from <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>,'' the Costa Rican president who relayed a complaint about a `` destructive role'' by <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> Even on Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, long a nemesis of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sounded an understanding note about what he portrayed as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s limited influence over a government that receives massive support from the Kremlin. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not want to imply that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` can just snap his fingers and have Mr. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> ... do what he said.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's broadcast service, opened its second Soviet bloc bureau Monday and launched discussions with Polish state radio on the exchange of programming. `` They were jamming us two years ago,'' said <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. To mark the opening of the <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> bureau, <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> prepared a live Monday night program permitting callers in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to discuss their country's economic situation with Polish-speaking experts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` This is unheard of given the context of our journalistic relationship with this country so recently,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. `` It is definitely amazing. We did not envision this at all.'' <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, which broadcasts in 43 languages to an estimated 130 million people worldwide, for years was jammed by East bloc countries and denounced by their leaders. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> correspondents were denied visas to work in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or given only limited access. Jamming has ended in the Soviet bloc in recent years, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said, and <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> opened a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bureau last year. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, heard by an estimated 50 percent of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s adults at least once a week, was given permanent accreditation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in April, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. No full-time correspondent has been assigned due to budget constraints, but the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> bureau will be staffed on a rotating basis by reporters stationed elsewhere. A <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> bureau also is being established by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, another long-time propaganda enemy for its uncensored reports to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The strict state control of Polish radio and TV loosened in 1988. The Solidarity-led government of <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, who became the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-communist leader in August, has vowed to free the flow of information. On Nov. 13, Polish Radio ran a live broadcast, provided by the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, of Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, which produces six hours of live Polish-language reports daily from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters, will continue talks with Polish authorities on placing its programming on state radio, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. Also being discussed are exchanges of broadcasters and training programs, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> correspondents are being welcomed elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as well. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> offers virtually free access, and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has provided ongoing accreditaion for Czech and English-language correspondents, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> recently allowed a <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> representative to cover an environmental forum.

<TEXT>
 Nearly 33 million retirees will have to pay premiums for several more months for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic coverage _ a program that will be abolished on Dec. 31. <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, blamed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' late action in repealing the law. She said Monday there is no way that Social Security computers can be adjusted more quickly to halt withholding of the premiums from monthly benefit checks. The premiums will be refunded in a lump sum later, Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` We have people going flat out ... but we wo n't be able to make all the changes until perhaps the end of April or the beginning of May,'' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. That means the great majority of retirees _ perhaps up to 29 million _ will have to pay $ 5.30 a month for three or four months for a program that will no longer exist. Some retirees pay less; others pay more. `` The bottom line is that Social Security will unscramble this egg, but we did not lay it,'' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter to Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> that `` a lengthy delay -LRB- in halting collection of the premiums -RRB- will create a firestorm of protest We must recognize the impending firestorm and move rapidly to alleviate the problem.'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> predicted that if the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> continues withholding the premiums until early summer, it could take the rest of the year for retirees to get their money back. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> estimated that would temporarily take $ 1 billion out of the pockets of the elderly. In many cases, he said, they need that money to pay private `` Medigap'' insurance policy premium increases expected to result from repeal of federal catastrophic coverage. `` We knew there might be a problem but I do n't think we expected it to take this long to resolve,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> normally gives the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administraton </ORGANIZATION> about a three-month lead time for changes.'' Since Jan. 1, most people 65 and older have been paying $ 4 a month to finance part of the cost of Medicare catastrophic coverage. The year-old program aims to prevent a retiree from being by bankrupted by a major illness. The monthly premium is scheduled to rise to $ 5.30 on Jan. 1. Premiums paid this year will not be refunded; they finance extended hospital coverage and other, minor catastrophic benefits that have been in effect since January. Two-thirds of the cost of the program would have been borne by higher-income retirees through an income surtax of up to $ 800 a year. Officials have no way of knowing whether those people have been making periodic payments of the surtax along with their quarterly estimated payments of income tax. Those who have, and those past 65 who are earning wages and may have paid the surtax through the withholding system, will be able to subtract the surtax from taxes due with they file their returns early next year. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> repealed catastrophic because of protests from those higher-income retirees and from others who have a private catastrophic plan or coverage geared to their retirement benefits. The repeal vote came Nov. 22. Although <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has adjourned until Jan. 23, the bill has not yet been delivered to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature. That could come this week. Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> said they regret that some people with the lowest income will be hurt by the delay in halting collection of the premiums. `` My concern is for those on fixed income who can not afford to see $ 5 go out of their checks,'' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` That's a lot of money for those people and it is little consolation for them to know they will get a refund in the future.''

<HEAD>Exchange Student and American Girlfriend Still Fighting Separation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Love has found new champions in the battle to allow a Finnish exchange student to return to high school here after being banished to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> because he was spending too much time with his American girlfriend. <PERSON> Iiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, 18, said he was given two hours to pack his bags Nov. 11 before being transferred to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, because exchange program leaders said his friendship with <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPointe </PERSON> was causing his grades to suffer. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION> briefly Sunday, spent about an hour at <ORGANIZATION> LaPointe </ORGANIZATION>'s home with her and her family, met with a state legislator who has taken an interest in the case and was interviewed for two national television programs. His transfer prompted a walk-out last week of about 100 students, a third of <PERSON> Farmington </PERSON>'s student body. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsors the exchange program, say <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> was transferred because he was spending too much time with <PERSON> LaPointe </PERSON> and not enough time with his host family. The group's regional director, <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, has denied anyone from her organization told the youths they had to break up, but <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said he was told by an official after he got to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> that he had two weeks to break up with <PERSON> LaPointe </PERSON>. He said the order since has been replaced with directives limiting him to one visit and two telephone conversations with <ORGANIZATION> LaPointe </ORGANIZATION> a month. State Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsiros </PERSON> said the move was an insult to <PERSON> Farmington </PERSON>'s hospitality and a violation of the boy's civil rights. The foundation and the host family `` are missing the point that it is normal for an 18-year-old boy to have a romantic relationship with a girl,'' <PERSON> Tsiros </PERSON> said. <PERSON> LaPointe </PERSON>, 17, said the foundation officials make it sound like she sat around all day in front of the television waiting for <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> to come over. `` I'm on the honor roll, I'm a Big Sister and I play sports year-round,'' she said. `` Whenever <PERSON> Iiro </PERSON> and I were together we were out with other people at high school games and functions.'' <PERSON> Tsiros </PERSON> said he has called state officials in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, federal officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the foundation headquarters in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to try to bring <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> back. And the boy's father has been lobbying from <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> to reverse the decision. The host family wo n't talk about the dispute.

<HEAD>World War II Horror Revived in Britain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is shedding the legacy of World War II, a British libel trial has in a way resurrected it. The case that Britons were reading about in their Sunday newspapers, even as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were meeting to shape the post-postwar era, revived a little-known horror in May 1945, when the British army repatriated 70,000 Cossack and Yugoslav refugees to a grisly fate at the hands of their communist enemies. The trial ended last week in a record $ 2.6 million award, and showed the abiding power of World War II to disrupt lives and pose painful questions a generation later. The victorious plaintiff in the High Court in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldington </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> deputy chairman, business leader and college head. In 1945 he was Brig. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON>, the officer based in Allied-occupied <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> who was ordered to implement the deportation. The most prominent defendant was Count <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON>, a historian who had written a pamphlet accusing <PERSON> Aldington </PERSON> of responsibility for sending the Cossacks and Yugoslavs, men, women and children, to the firing squads or labor camps. <PERSON> Aldington </PERSON>, 74, endured 30 hours of cross-examination. At one stage he stopped answering questions and wept. <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON> and co-defendant <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, a realtor who distributed the pamphlet, were ordered to pay the damages plus an almost equal sum in legal costs. <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON> said the verdict had left him financially ruined. For some, the case had modern-day resonances in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s imminent plans to repatriate 40,000 Vietnamese boat people encamped in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Columnist <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, 46, wrote in The Sunday Times that his generation should be wary of using hindsight to judge officers acting 44 years ago in the chaotic aftermath of a five-year war. But he wondered whether after the boat people were dealt with, `` after hundreds more deaths, will there be remorseful memoirs, bitter accusations _ and yet more libel trials?'' The Russian Cossacks and Yugoslavs who had fled the Soviet army to safety behind British lines were anti-Communist, anti-Soviet, and in many cases had fought for the Germans. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had agreed secretly with Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> to return all Soviet and Yugoslav prisoners. It had no illusions the evacuees faced a rough time after repatriation, but felt bound by the agreement in order to ensure the repatriation of its own prisoners in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> hands. The story that unfolded over nine weeks in the packed court was filled with anguish. It told of British authorities resorting to subterfuge, telling the prisoners they were being sent to safety in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>; of prisoners killing themselves while still in British hands; of British soldiers allowing prisoners to escape rather than have them on their conscience; of other soldiers rifle-butting them into the trains, despising them for having been pro-German. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolson </PERSON>, a young officer at the time, remembered seeing men herded into cattle trucks and sent screaming to certain execution. `` We considered it one of the most disgraceful operations any British troops anywhere had been ordered to undertake,'' <PERSON> Nicolson </PERSON>, now 72, testified. <PERSON> Aldington </PERSON> said he had only obeyed orders and had no reason to believe executions would follow. `` There were many officers who were very unhappy about what we had to do and I was amongst them, but I did n't make a fuss about it. I just got on with my job,'' he testified. <PERSON> Aldington </PERSON> told his cross-examiner: `` You say I knew they were going to be massacred. That is not what I was told. I was told that war criminals would be tried and others would be put to work. `` It is terrible what happened, I know. Nobody's denying that what happened was ghastly. I do n't understand why you want to harry me over and over again.'' <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON>, the British-born grandson of a Russian Cossack, has written several books aimed at exposing what he calls an `` inexcusable cover-up in British public life.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, a teacher of European studies who testified for <PERSON> Aldington </PERSON>, wrote in the Guardian that <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON> had `` sunk into the swamp of his own conspiracy theory.'' In summing up, the judge said some might think the verdict would settle the debate for good. `` It would be very nice to think it would,'' he said. `` But it seems to me unlikely that will happen.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today hailed the `` peaceful revolution'' sweeping Communist Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but pledged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would keep `` significant military forces'' on the continent as long as allied leaders want them there. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who spent the weekend in summit talks with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, emerged from a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders to praise the Soviet leader's handling of the changes throughout the Eastern Bloc. He it `` absolutely mandates new thinking'' on the part of Western leaders. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would n't go along with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s post-summit declaration on Sunday that the world was leaving the `` epoch of the Cold War. Said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` If I signal to you there's no Cold War then they'll say, ` Well, what are you doing with troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>?' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meeting with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders was private. But Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> told reporters the president said the superpower leaders agreed in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> to aim for an East-West summit in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> next summer to sign a landmark treaty reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Let's get it done,'' the president said at his news conference. He said he wanted the accord `` in the bank'' before moving on to more complicated matters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the allied leaders met as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was convening a meeting of a radically reordered <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The president was in good humor as he neared the end of his summit journey. He laughed off a reporter's suggestion that he had been at risk during bad weather in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> when he boarded a small boat for a brief trip through rough seas to return to a warship anchored offshore. `` These charismatic, visionary, macho guys, they'll do anything,'' he said to laughter. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was flying home shortly after his news conference. The 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations are negotiating in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on cuts in conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as saying he hoped an accord could be reached about mid-1990. Conventional forces aside, the superpowers are negotiating a treaty to cut long-range nuclear weapons by up to 50 percent, and a separate agreement on banning chemical weapons. On the subject of trade, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signaled his intention anew to help the battered Soviet economy. But when asked whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would be invited to next year's economic summit of industrial democracies, he replied, `` two chances _ slim and none _ for that particular meeting. Nor did he request to be included in that particular meeting,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that while `` all was not sweetness and light'' at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit, even as he applauded <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s handling of the change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Asked what had emerged at the summit, he said `` I think he took my measure and I took his and I think we both feel more comfortable about our common objectives.'' He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was `` determined and unemotional `` in their private talks. The Soviet leader `` seemed very much in control'' and `` very confident in discussing without notes a wide array of subjects with me.'' The conventional arms talks are designed to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 30,000 and Soviet troops by 325,000 to a level of about 275,000 on each side. The negotiations also are attempting to control tanks and other weapons. `` The importance of this is that it indicates both -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- want to make an effort to reach such an agreement next year,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> said. `` In that context, the term mid-1990 was mentioned. Without a doubt, that should be regarded as positive,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked whether the improvement in East-West relations could free money for domestic programs such as education and the homeless. `` I think it is premature to speak as some are at home about a peace dividend,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted large federal deficits and said there is n't `` excess money'' available. The president began his news conference with a statement that said a `` peaceful revolution'' was taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where five hardline communist regimes have fallen in recent weeks _ and some coutries have experienced more than one change in government. He said his goal was to see `` individual freedom everywhere replace coercion and tyranny.'' He said the task for Western nations is to consolidate the fruits of this peaceful revolution and provide the architecture or the continued peaceful changes and end the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and create a `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whole and free.'' At the same time, he said the Western alliance `` must remain strong,'' and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will maintain significant military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as long as our allies desire our presence.'' Even as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was preparing to leave for home, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was making arrangements for a trip to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> next week. His trip will take him to the most notable symbol of the Cold War _ the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> _ which has effectively crumbled. A British official said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s summit briefing for allied leaders was `` extremely well-received'' and that today's session showed `` very strong support for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined his agreements and differences with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Most everyone there was very pleased,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies were particularly interested in the issue of German reunification, which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> opposes. `` The president is certainly not going to stand in the way of reunification, but it needs to proceed at its own pace,'' <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' According to a knowledgeable Belgian source, who spoke only on condition he not be identified, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s denial that the Soviets were supplying arms to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> as `` out of step with the new thinking'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The arrival of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 10-car motorcade at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters for the second meeting of allied leaders this year was heralded by a noisy helicopter, providing security and surveillance for the entourage. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> staff members applauded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he briskly strode into the building. In opening remarks, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders' second meeting since May `` reflects the accelerated pace of political change across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' He said `` the question of the architecture of the future <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has arrived before us, more quickly than anyone could have predicted.'' The president, who flew here Sunday night immediately after the summit, had said the meeting helped dispel <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s doubts about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attitude toward economic and political reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> applauds the fall of hard-line communist regimes throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think he has me down as a total negativist at all and I certainly do n't have him down'' that way, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said before leaving the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, where he held eight hours of discussions with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> aboard the Soviet cruise liner Maxim Gorky.

<TEXT>
 A defiant liberty bell stands on a hill above <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, but many now notice revolutionaries failed to add a clapper to their makeshift symbol. They're still building the revolution. `` The Communists are playing for time, and we ca n't rest a minute,'' said <PERSON> Lenka </PERSON> <PERSON> Ressova </PERSON>, a young technician, before joining more than 150,000 people Monday on <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. The crowd, chanting, `` Resign! Resign!'' delivered its verdict on a new Communist-dominated Cabinet meant to shape a new <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In thundering unison, people added, `` Free elections!'' But at opposition headquarters, Civic Forum leaders wrestled with a problem now familiar as the Iron Curtain tatters: Where to find popular, experienced leaders in societies ruled 40 years by a single ideology. `` They're fighting over every line,'' reported a Civic Forum member, emerging from strategy talks over how to protest a new government of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holdovers and only five little-known outsiders. `` This will not be easy.'' He asked anonymity, no longer afraid of secret police but wanted to stay clear of internal politics. The overall mood is confident, even ebullient, as Czechoslovaks try out new freedoms few dreamed were possible only weeks ago. But cold, hard realism has replaced the first warm rush. A clear strain of anxiety that marked faces at Monday's mass rally was reflected all over town. Politics penetrated every crevice of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. `` No one talks of anything else,'' said <PERSON> Hana </PERSON> <PERSON> Lingerova </PERSON>, slinging plates of roast pork at the Old Synagogue cafe. She amused customers by making folds in a banknote to turn a pictured Communist hero into the movie alien from `` E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial.'' In downtown metro stops, huge crowds mobbed public TV sets. In the outskirts, people rose at 3:30 a.m. to get the morning papers before they sold out. At the <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION>, frazzled students watched TV, nibbled at stale sandwiches and churned out leaflets on their prehistoric computers. <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Horak </PERSON>, 21, studied a visiting reporter's passport with more care than the immigration officer at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` Infiltrators are trying to sneak in, to divide us and change our minds,'' he said. A revolutionary guard was comprised of four sleepy students armed with a guitar. <PERSON> Horak </PERSON> acknowledged that although people demand that the Communists hand over power, no alternate leaders were emerging. `` Our leaders are compromised, and the people who could lead were driven off,'' he said. Asked about <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Horak </PERSON> gave the awkward shrug which often greets that name. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, a powerful symbol, led <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to the `` Prague Spring'' that was crushed by <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> tanks 21 years ago. But for most young people, he has been a Communist for too long. <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, the playwright whose life-long insistence on human freedoms shaped the script for the revolution, rejects any prolonged role in the politics of what comes next. In the vacuum of power, untested names rise in moments of glory. There are insistent calls for <PERSON> Valtr </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarek </PERSON>, a reform-minded economist, but critics say he is blemished by his close ties to the failing system. `` Now comes the hard part, the pressure of the mind,'' said <PERSON> Jaroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesetril </PERSON>, a professor who dropped in to check on the students. `` The Communists are more experienced, more organized. It is in nature that everything is reversible.'' In the bowels of the ABC Theater, people who helped bring off the revolution harbor few illusions about the next act. They admire <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and the intellectuals around him, but most agree it is time for others to move in. `` That is the question, where to find the leaders,'' said <PERSON> Ivo </PERSON> <PERSON> Niederle </PERSON>, a popular actor. `` We must find them.'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> has offered to play some sort of transitional role, but has made it plain he is not eager to be the missing clapper in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s liberty bell. Late Saturday night, he emerged from a dinner, haggard. `` Are you going into politics?'' he was asked. `` I'm going to bed,'' he replied.

<HEAD>Endorsing European Change Easier Than Keeping Pace with It</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are finding it easier to endorse political change in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than to deal with the consequences. After a summit meeting in which both leaders envisioned an end to East-West rivalry, they face the considerably more difficult task of redefining their respective military alliances without upsetting a balance of power established through 40 years of Cold War. For <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the assignment is especially tricky. He seeks to preserve his <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliance at the same time that its hard-line communist regimes are being swept aside. During the post-summit news conference, a <LOCATION> Czechoslovakian </LOCATION> journalist pointedly asked whether he had renounced the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> doctrine used to justify the 1968 Soviet invasion of that country as it began to tip Westward. `` Every nation is an independent entity in world politics and every people has the right to choose its own destiny, the destiny of its own state,'' the Soviet leader replied. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s response underscored the diminishing role _ and perhaps ability _ of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to control the political avalanche in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` No one can avoid this evolutionary process,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, following <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in response to the Czechoslovakian question, praised the Soviet leader for the reforms he has started in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies. However, the president is not as eager to claim, as the Soviet leader had at the joint news conference, that the `` epoch of the cold war'' is over. On Monday, after he briefed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Is the Cold War raging like it was before, in the times of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> blockade? Absolutely not. But if I signal to you there's no Cold War, then they'll say, ` Well, what are you doing with troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>?''' Both leaders say they want to preserve the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact to maintain stability, but want to conclude an agreement by late 1990 to cut troops in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, withdrawing 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and 325,000 Soviet soldiers. The memory of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which invaded many <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> members during World War II, still looms large in the European equation. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has expressed concern about a proposal last week by West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> for a confederation of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Soviet officials say <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has never renounced its claims to the pre-war German borders, which included parts of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to assuage those Soviet fears by reaffirming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords, which were signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and 33 other nations and `` spells out a concept of permanent borders.'' The <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, `` summed up the results of the Second World War and consolidated the results of the war. ... And the reality is such that we have today's <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with two German states.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position that any move toward the reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will have to be gradual and respect the rights of people on both sides of the present border to self-determination. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made it clear that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will keep its troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as long as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies want them there. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will remain a <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> power, and that means that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will stay engaged in the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and in our common defense,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. To cope with Soviet concerns about <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> unified outside the postwar alliance strucure and to keep pace with the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has accepted Polish proposals to restructure the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should do the same, he said. `` They should not remain military alliances, but rather military-political alliances and later on, just political alliances, so that their nature would change in accordance with the changes on the continent,'' he said.

 A U.S.-Soviet dispute over naval disarmament, unrelieved by the weekend seaside summit, will likely keep the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> the world's most heavily armed waters for years to come. Along with <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the rivalry of the two superpower navies, especially in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, surfaced as the most publicly divisive issue to confront President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their storm-buffetted sessions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ruled out any immediate progress. `` The chairman raised the question of naval arms control and I was not particularly positive in responding,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a concluding joint news conference with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` We still have differences with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He knows it and I know it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> put it even more bluntly. `` Naval forces are absolutely crucial to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said in a Sunday interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press.'' `` We are a major maritime power. Our ability to reinforce our allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is tied to our naval forces and we're not interested in limitations on those forces,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. A setting for fierce battles since the birth of Western civilization, the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> since World War II has seen many engagements and confrontations among the 17 bordering nations and outside powers like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 6th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, whose flagship the USS <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home for the summit, keeps 30 ships, 100 aircraft and 20,000 troops at sea, operating under <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> direction in case of conflict Most of the largest recipients of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid _ <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> _ border the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> keeps bases in four <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> countries. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has flown over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> to bomb <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, shipped Marines through it to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and intercepted airliners and ships carrying terrorists above and through its waters. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, on the other hand, has been steadily decreasing its Mediterranean fleet to 30 or 40 vessels since 1985. Still, it regularly steams through the Turkish Straits with its two guided-missile cruisers with nuclear capabilities. One of them, the <PERSON> Slava </PERSON>, was anchored in <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> here for the summit. Storm conditions prevented it from hosting Saturday's summit talk between the two leaders, as originally planned In the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, the Soviets are building the first helicopter carrier of its class, the <LOCATION> Tblisi </LOCATION>. It is expected to sail through the straits into the sea sometime in 1990. Those straits accommodate the flow of more than 50 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s sea-carried Soviet exports and imports, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates. And Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships have been docking more regularly at <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and even in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> recently _ heightening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern. Before arriving in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> used a state dinner in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to revive his year-old proposal for a nuclear-free Mediterranean. His plan would establish a ceiling for naval forces of both nations and their eventual withdrawal from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. This would be accompanied by a nuclear-free zone in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed the proposal again by replying that arms reductions in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> _ and specifically <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ could only take place if a global treaty were reached on conventional weapons reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was likely to continue substantial financing for its submarine operations to counter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> submarine-launched cruise missiles, which have a servicing base on the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Sardinia </LOCATION>. `` The Southern flank is the weakest part of our alliance,'' says Professor <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacchia </PERSON>, director or Strategic Studies at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> `` It is less important from the point of view of the concentration of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Western military forces, but it is certainly more vulnerable.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, whether they like it or not, have a major role to fill in this area for a long time in the foreseeable future,'' he added.

 A man accused of killing his 77-year-old father in his hospital bed was in stable condition Monday recovering from two self-inflicted gunshot wounds, officials said. <PERSON> Leonide </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaud </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 47, was under police guard at <ORGANIZATION> Waterville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Osteopathic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michaud </PERSON> was charged with murder after he allegedly shot and killed his father, <PERSON> Leonide </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaud </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION>, at the Thayer Unit of <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>King Appoints Islamic Sympathizer Prime Minister</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> resigned Monday and was replaced by <PERSON> Mudar </PERSON> <PERSON> Badran </PERSON>, who has held the office twice before and is sympathetic to Islamic fundamentalists. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> told <PERSON> Badran </PERSON> to concentrate on improving <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s dismal economy situation and to support the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON>'s resignation had been expected following parliamentary elections last month, the first nationwide balloting in 22 years. He took office in April after the resignation of <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> and formed a transitional government for the purpose of preparing for the elections. The king assigned the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> to continue its duties until <PERSON> Badran </PERSON> forms a new one. `` I ask you to work with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and to support the steadfastness of our brothers, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in their occupied territories,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON> Badran </PERSON>, the former chief of the royal court. The monarch stressed the importance of increasing the kingdom's foreign currency reserves and maintaining the Jordanian dinar's purchasing Since late last year, the dinar's value against other currencies has fallen sharply under the pressure of foreign debts of more than $ 8.3 billion. Riots triggered by price increases of 10 percent to 50 percent for food and fuel led to riots that killed nine people in April and led to <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>'s resignation. Royal palace officials said naming of a new Cabinet might be delayed because of disputes among potential new ministers over the assignment of portfolios. The palace officials said the new Cabinet would include some former ministers, some members of the royally appointed senate and some deputies elected Nov. 8. According to one royal palace source, the disputes stem from three Moslem Brotherhood deputies who were assigned portfolios `` which they did not accept.'' The source did not explain what chairs they were assigned but he said they were seeking the portfolios of education, higher education and Islamic religious affairs. The Moslem Brotherhood, which won 25 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, campaigned to impose stricter Islamic laws and improve social welfare benefits. There are nearly three dozen deputies in the 80-seat Parliament with Islamic leanings. <PERSON> Badran </PERSON> is known to sympathize with extremist Moslem factions, including the Moslem Brotherhood. The November elections were the first nationwide poll since 1967 when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> last year renounced <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s claim to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Badran </PERSON>, who graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Damscus </ORGANIZATION> in 1957 with a law degree, served as prime minister as well as defense and foreign affairs minister in 1976-79 and 1980-84. During both of <PERSON> Badran </PERSON>'s terms, <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> deteriorated, first because Syrian alleged <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> was supporting Moslem Brotherhood activists seeking to topple Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. The countries reconciled in 1979 after <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> joined together to oppose the Camp David peace treaty between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A year later, relations were severed again when <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> sided with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in its war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main backer. When <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> patched up his relations with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> in 1985, he apologized for Jordanian backing of the <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> and claimed it had been carried out without his knowledge by previous governments, including <PERSON> Badran </PERSON>'s. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s relations with its powerful northern neighbor are lukewarm, mainly because it opposes Syrian's military presence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. As royal court chief, <PERSON> Badran </PERSON> was responsible for palace operations and served as a key political adviser to <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. The post has often been a stepping stone to the prime minister's office.

 The defense rested Monday in the manslaughter trial of a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> policeman after rolling a motorcycle into the courtroom to show jurors how the vehicle looked the day the defendant shot and killed its driver. The case could go to final arguments Tuesday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 31, a suspended officer, faces two manslaughter counts in the January deaths of the bike's driver, <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, and passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, both black. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> is Colombian born.

 A $ 16 million personal backruptcy plan for former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> won court approval today after two years of wrangling, but the government may appeal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would get about $ 13 million it is owed in yearly installments. The government argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> assets could be dissipated before the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> gets paid. <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> cleared way for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s many creditors to begin collecting under Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules whether or not there is a government appeal. The judge harshly criticized <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, 70, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> whose fortune crumbled after a bank he owned collapsed. The judge noted that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> had come before the court in a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> hearing Sunday and criticized his creditors, his lawyers and the courts. `` He places the blame on many parties,'' <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> said. `` But I never once heard Mr. <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> place the blame where it belongs, and that's squarely on his own shoulders.'' However, the judge said he believed it was `` important for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to have this plan approved.'' He said it would get him out of the courts and `` restore some of his dignity.'' `` I wish him no ill will,'' the judge added. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Orth </PERSON> said, `` The issues in this case weighed heavily on the judge's mind, and he did what he could. ... I think Mr. <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> did take responsibility in this case. He made mistakes, but they were mistakes in litigation not in life.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> promised Sunday to deposit $ 6 million with the creditors' committee to complete the plan, then he said he would look for `` a little air and sunshine. <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> on Sunday also approved $ 3.6 million in fees to attorneys and accountants including Price-Waterhouse, which spent thousands of hours analyzing <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s financial transactions since his <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> collapsed in 1985. The Home State failure caused a crisis for 69 other <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> savings and loans whose deposits were insured by the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Deposit Guarantee Fund. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from creditors in October 1987 under federal bankruptcy law to halt $ 4 billion in claims against him. The judge said today's hearing was needed to conclude arguments for the plan. `` We're anxious to rid ourselves of litigation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said, referring to the bank collapse that precipitated his bankruptcy filing. `` My wife and I have fought this thing for five years. We believe there is a little air and sunshine somewhere on this planet for us.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, 70, who lives in <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, criticized the treatment he has received in court and the advice he has received from lawyers. But the judge defended his actions. `` I'm satisfied that he has received fair treatment before this court. I make no apologies to Mr. <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> or anyone else in this case,'' <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> had offered in November to pay creditors $ 17.5 million on the condition he be allowed to pursue lawsuits against the accounting firms <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which had audited Home State before the collapse. He agreed to drop the proposed change and have the case converted from Chapter 11 status to a Chapter 7 liquidation after creditors refused to allow the case to be tied up in further lawsuits. A jury in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> found <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> guilty in March 1987 on charges resulting from Home State's collapse. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was sentenced to 3 -LCB- years in prison, but a state appellate court recently rejected the convictions. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> prosecutors plan to ask the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the convictions. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> has spent $ 5.6 million prosecuting the case against <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and has made provisions to recover about $ 135 million as reimbursement for protecting Home State's depositors. The thrift had about $ 1.4 billion in assets and served about 92,000 depositors. It was sold and reopened in June 1985.

<HEAD>Bush Support on German Question May Open New Divide Among Allies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday endorsed a cautious and measured approach to reunifying <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, instilling gratitude in West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> but wariness among some other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated at a special session of Western alliance leaders that a single German state still loyal to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would express the yearning of Germans for unity as well as the right to a nation's self-determination `` We are not trying to accelerate the process,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later told a news conference wrapping up his talks with allied leaders here. `` It's better to let things move on their own.'' But his concept of a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> within a future <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> bound by common goals and values gave new life to an issue that stirs concern on both sides of the East-West divide. `` Self-determination must be pursued without prejudice to its outcome,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in recapping his views on reunification. He said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> must remain committed to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, `` with due regard for the legal role and responsibilities of the Allied powers,'' and said reunification would have to be `` peaceful, gradual, and part of a step-by-step basis.'' He said he thought <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> `` feels comfortable'' with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> terms on rejoining the two Germanys, and stressed that no time frame has been identified for reunification. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> expressed thanks for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` support on those questions of concern to us Germans.'' The `` German Question'' dominated and intensified the alliance gathering called to discuss the weekend summit in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, which also dwelled heavily on the democratic reform wave eroding <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s political divide. The changes reshaping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> most directly affect the Germans, who have been separated since World War II into the rival camps of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> spelled out his own 10-point plan for reunification before the special <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> gathering, and complained that some allies have rejected it without study. `` People outside <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are speaking of these plans without even having read them,'' the chancellor said, declining to name the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders who oppose the quest for reunification. `` We are most grateful to the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- president for having shown understanding and offered support for our position as Germans,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. `` He also did so at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>.'' In contrast, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> appeared at her post-summit briefing to be clearly perturbed by elements of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s address, though she did not specify the subject of German reunification. `` We must continue <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> with present borders, because to do anything else would be to jeopardize the security that we seek,'' a British source who did not want to be named, quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as telling the allies. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> suggested that jealous over German economic might could be at the root of the opposition. `` <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with its economic power, is already too strong for the liking of many,'' the chancellor said pointedly. The combined German nations would have a population of nearly 80 million with which to fuel the economic locomotive that has already made <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> the biggest exporting nation in the world and the wealthiest per capita, according to some measures. `` If we had this same discussion in 1982, when our economic situation was completely different than that which exists in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today, the discussion would not have been so difficult,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said, making clear there was a debate over the unity plan. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> sought to allay fears that a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would pose any threat to either the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance or the stability of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He attempted to draw a distinction between the concept of `` inviolable borders'' and `` untouchable borders.'' The 1976 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Act ensures the inviolability of present-day European borders, which opponents of reunification contend rules out the recarving of a single <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from the two currently existing. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> argued that border revisions of mutual consent between two states are a matter of `` self-determination,'' another of the rights recognized among the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies and countries signing the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> reiterated <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s promise that it seeks reunification in a step-by-step manner consistent with the European process that seeks disarmament and erasure of military and political divisions. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call for a common European home is that which we also speak of in the process of reunification,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said.'' Everything we do in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is embedded in the development of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> overall. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the emergence of a single German state would pose no problem as long as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> stands by its commitments to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance and the European Community. And <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> vowed that those principles are part of the bedrock of West German policy. `` Solution of the German question is only possible under a European roof,'' the chancellor said. Attempting to convince some wary allies that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is devoted to assisting the whole of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in its drive for democracy, the chancellor noted that his government has established a billion-dollar relief fund for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and that his visit to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> next week will provide aid for that reformist nation as well. But he conceded that `` understandably, the developments in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have distracted attention from developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'' among West Germans.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday it's too early to proclaim an end to the Cold War, but added that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s acceptance of sweeping reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` absolutely mandates new thinking'' by the West. Wrapping up his weekend summit journey with a stop at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told reporters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would maintain `` significant military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as long as our allies desire our presence.'' The president said he wants a treaty making initial cuts in superpowers conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` in the bank'' before seeking deeper reductions. He told <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders he hoped a multinational summit could be convened in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> next summer to sign such an accord. Conventional forces aside, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are negotiating a proposed 50 percent cut in long-range nuclear weapons, as well as a proposed ban of chemical weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in a buoyant mood as he neared the end of a journey that took him to last weekend's summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Asked if it had n't been risky to venture out in a small boat in the storm-tossed harbor in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> during the weekend, he replied, `` Hot dogging? ... No. You know these charismatic, macho, visionary guys. They'll do anything.'' The president <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was convening a meeting of a radically reordered <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to review the weekend summit. The superpower leaders agreed at an unprecedented joint news conference before leaving <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> that their meeting heralded a new era of cooperation in East-West relations, including arms control and trade. They intend to meet again in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the second half of June. At his news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We stand at the threshold of a new era ...'' but declined to assert the Cold War has ended as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested. `` That day has n't arrived,'' the president said when asked about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statement declaring an end to the `` epoch of the Cold War.'' Barring a utopian development, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must stay involved'' by keeping troops massed against <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> forces. `` If you want to project out 100 years, or take some years off of that, you can look to a utopian day when there might be none -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' he said. `` But as I pointed out to them -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders -RRB-, that day has n't arrived _ and they agree with me.'' The president began his news conference with a statement that said a `` peaceful revolution'' was taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where five hard line communist regimes have fallen in recent weeks. He said his goal was to see `` individual freedom everywhere replace coercion and tyranny.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, apparently referring to disagreements about <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said `` all was not sweetness and light'' at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit, but took pains to applaud <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s handling of the change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` As I watched the way in which Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has handled the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it deserves new thinking. It absolutely mandates new thinking,'' he said. Asked what had emerged at the summit, he said `` I think he took my measure and I took his and I think we both feel more comfortable about our common objectives.'' He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was `` determined and unemotional `` in their private talks. The Soviet leader `` seemed very much in control'' and `` very confident in discussing without notes a wide array of subjects with me.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said some allied nations seek deeper cuts in conventional forces than are being considered in the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks. But he said they viewed `` the rapidity of change differently than we do.'' And yet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> registered a renewed personal determination to realize completion of the treaty next year between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact that would cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops by 30,000 and the Soviets by 325,000, to an equal level of 275,000. The two alliances' armories of tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear weapons also are due to be cut back in a grand scheme to reduce tensions from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> across the vast expanse of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Let's get it done,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He told reporters, `` I, as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, will kick the bureaucracy to get it done.'' Negotiators working on the accord in the Austrian capital are making brisk progress but several issues are unresolved, most significantly a dispute over the kind of Soviet airplanes to be scrapped. In addition, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was hopeful the West could take steps to ease Soviet economic woes. `` We want to try to meet him on some of the areas where he needs help. I'm thinking of a few suggestions I had in the economic area,'' he said. `` But I also believe that the West must remain strong and together and try to be helpful where we can in a united way, but not be imprudent,'' he said. Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reported to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had accepted the multi-nation summit proposal for next year. `` The importance of this is that it indicates both -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- want to make an effort to reach such an agreement next year,'' the Dutch official told reporters. Also at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> session <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined his policy on German reunification. It rejected a timetable, even though <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> on Sunday had predicted a merger of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> within five years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he favored a step by step approach that also maintained West German membership in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in line with his campaign not to alarm <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> or to assume an aggressive role in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said: `` I am not trying to accelerate that process.'' Even so, officials announced that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was sending Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> next week for a symbolic visit to the Berlin Wall, a symbol of the Cold War that has been opened to free travel.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies Monday welcomed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s determination to keep strong military links to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> despite the diminishing security threat posed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, though, appeared to have qualms about some of the president's remarks, in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raised the possibility of greater arms cuts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and even closer ties among the European Community nations. She said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech to leaders of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> `` was so full of meat that we really should consider it very carefully before we reply to it.'' Others were not so hesitant. Dutch Prime Minister <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> said he was impressed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' `` extraordinarily positive attitude'' toward events in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` It has nothing to do with a ` we are pulling out' attitude,'' he told reporters. `` On the contrary, they are again promising a meaningful presence -LRB- in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' Belgian officials said it was obvious that the president took <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> seriously. Just last week, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters trying to dispel fears that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would unilaterally pull its troops out of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> because of budget deficit pressures and reduced East-West tensions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, too, went out of his way to reassure the allies after giving them an account of his weekend talks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. `` I pledge today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will maintain significant military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as long as our allies desire our presence as part of a common security effort,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the allies during a closed-door meeting. His remarks were later released by the White House. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will remain a <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> power,'' he said. `` That means the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will stay engaged in the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and in our common defense.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said his reassurance was a key outcome of the meeting. Reports of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> plans to slash military spending in coming years have raised concern about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' future ties to its European allies. Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said there was no question of withdrawing his country's forces from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> provides a security link between the two <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations and those in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The officials stressed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s importance during the dizzying pace of political and economic reforms in some of the countries of the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's military alliance. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> was `` more relevant now than ever.'' `` It offers both security and stability,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Belgian Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> agreed it has an essential role to play at a time of change. In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put special emphasis on negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact to slash conventional, or non-nuclear, arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Last May, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered a sweeping plan to reduce those weapons and set a one-year deadline for negotiating a treaty. `` We have made good progress since then,'' he said, `` but too little and too slowly to take full advantage of the opportunity before us: the chance to ease the Soviet army out of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and substantially reduce the risk of surprise attack and aggression.'' He warned the other leaders that the arms bargaining `` could be overrun by events. That could be dangerous and we must avoid it.'' He said he was `` prepared to look with an open mind at ways in which we can together achieve even lower levels of conventional and nuclear forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as part of a negotiated agreement.'' The president urged the 12 nations of the European Community trading bloc to press ahead, maybe even intensify, efforts to become more closely bound. The nations are trying to dismantle trade barriers to create a single, European-wide market by the end of 1992. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the community also should play a role `` as a magnet that draws the forces of reform forward in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' His remarks touched on sensitive topics for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. She has urged a more cautious attitude than some of the allies toward the events unfolding in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. She also has been isolated from other Common Market members over plans for a tight economic and monetary union that would lead to a common currency and European-wide central bank system. The community holds a summit later this week in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, to thrash out these issues. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> insisted she did not feel left out of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> talks. `` Time after time, the word caution came -LRB- up -RRB-,'' she said. `` Turmoil can be very disturbing,'' she said, `` and we do n't know what may happen. She said the reform paths embarked on by the East European governments were difficult. `` It's easier to demand freedom than it is to set a structure of freedom in place,'' she said. <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was `` not at all fearful of the possibilities of rapprochement in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and of the European healing process.'' `` They obviously see it as a very positive adventure,'' he said.

 Temperatures dropped to record lows Monday as far south as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> registered just 33 degrees, and the cold plus up to 2 feet of fresh snow closed schools and slowed travel in parts of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>. `` We're looking at an Arctic blast here,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Authorities in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> stepped up efforts to get homeless people into warm shelter. At least 11 deaths were blamed on the weather during the weekend. Pre-dawn temperatures at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, were in the single digits, but 25 mph wind made it feel like 30 degrees below zero, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` This is our first real arctic air outbreak of the season,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of the weather service at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where it was 15 degrees Monday. But relief was on the way with a warm front sweeping across the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. At midday, temperatures across <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> ranged from 32 on the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lakefront to 51 at <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. And in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, the problem was melting snow and heavy rain that threatened floods and caused mudslides, one of which pushed a van off a busy road east of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Temperatures hit record lows Monday all across <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, including 47 at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, 39 at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION>, 33 at <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, 40 at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> and 27 at <LOCATION> Apalachicola </LOCATION>. Most of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> had record lows, including 25 at the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> port of Mobile. In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION> each hit a record low of 20. But <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus growers welcomed the weather. `` Actually, a cold snap like this can be quite beneficial,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Temperatures in the 30s accelerate citrus growth and put the trees into a dormant phase, which give them greater resistance to cold in the future, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> reported delays of two hours Monday on trains between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because of weather-related problems in a fiber optics cable which handles switches, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. Temporary repairs were made by afternoon. Shelters for the homeless were full overnight in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. And officials said two vans were on the street overnight to provide warm food and drinks to homeless people who either could n't find shelter or refused to go indoors. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Friday announced the opening of a 200-bed shelter at a <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> armory after renovations. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rood </PERSON> said the 730-bed Pine Street Inn in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was full Sunday, with some people staying in the lobby. `` On any given night, we are serving 1,000 people,'' <PERSON> Rood </PERSON> said. A low of 18 and wind chill of minus 10 to minus 25, plus already crowded shelters, forced <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> officials to add 125 beds for the homeless, to a total of 2,975. A ferocious weekend snowstorm in northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> left Caribou under 21 inches of fresh snow, for a total depth of 30 inches, and high wind Monday caused widespread drifting. Commuters in the area apparently heeded the cue to stay home, said state police, who reported almost empty highways. Schools were closed in two counties of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where the remote community of <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, at an elevation of 3,500 feet, got 14 inches of snow. `` We're real used to it here,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON>, a high school principal and teacher. Lake-effect storms fed by moisture from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> moderated after blanketing western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, received 18 inches and nearby <PERSON> Chaffee </PERSON> got 15 inches, with 20 - to 30-mph wind piling drifts up to 3 feet high, the weather service said Squalls produced up to a foot of snow in northeastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and in western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The cold was blamed for the deaths of one homeless man in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and two in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. The weather was blamed for at least three deaths on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state roads and investigators blamed an overheated wood stove for a fire that killed three people in <LOCATION> Chautauqua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. One person was killed in a crash on an icy <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> road.

 Ordinary East Germans are glad the old order is gone and seem to feel it's been worth the risk, even though they worry about an uncertain future. `` Right now, the situation is nothing but chaos,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON>, 24, one of dozens of East Berliners interviewed one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and the entire party leadership resigned. `` No one knows what's up,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fieberlkorn </PERSON>. `` That those involved in the corruption are gone is good, but what comes now is unknown.'' `` New Forum itself has no real perspective,'' he said of the largest opposition group, which claims a membership of 200,000. Opposition groups have grown rapidly in two months of pro-democracy protest, but have not put forth long-term programs. `` Maybe <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> can salvage something,'' <PERSON> Fiebelkorn </PERSON> said of the premier who is emerging as the nation's main political figure. `` We continue to go to work and hope that things will get better.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has serious economic problems, intensified by the mass exodus to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of nearly 300,000 people, most of them young, skilled workers. In 40 years of communism, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> attained a relatively high standard of living compared with other Soviet Bloc countries, but its industry is outdated and the communications network near collapse. Business was done as usual Monday on <LOCATION> Leipziger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, a broad shopping avenue, but the resignations and reports of widespread corruption under the old guard <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s people replaced were on people's minds. `` I'm not disappointed this happened,'' <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> said, `` but what lies in the future? New Fourm, they themselves do n't know what to do. They know what was wrong, but have no concept of what to do and no one who can take over.'' <PERSON> Mareike </PERSON> <PERSON> Boettger </PERSON>, 28, expressed outrage at reports of massive corruption in the party and reports that top officials led luxurious lives. `` I do n't have anything against a high politician having a little luxury, but what they have done is shameless,'' she said. `` We are glad they are out.'' Of East Germans leaving for the West, she said: `` Those people who are still going there are doing it just for material things. We have to stay here and rebuild out economy. `` To do that we will need foreign investments. We know there will be many problems, but I have never given a thought to leaving here.'' Ms. <PERSON> Boettger </PERSON> works at an export company. <PERSON> Heike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nestler </PERSON> said officials found guilty of corruption should be punished severely, because `` they obtained their luxury at our expense and the expense of their own children. Young people led the movement for democratic reforms because of the lack of freedom, she said. `` It was n't that we had it bad. We had everything. Young mothers have state-run kindergartens, a lot of support to raise children. But there was no freedom to travel. To get permission to travel you had to kneel on the ground and beg.'' <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalischer </PERSON>, 26, walking his wife <PERSON> Isabina </PERSON>, 21, said he was a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, and `` for us, this corruption is a big disappointment.'' `` We no longer trusted them. Even <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>. ... Those people were supposed to set an example. `` I find it good that they are out. ... It needed to be cleaned out completely. But what happens now, that's the big question? Without the party nothing will work.''

 Just days before the Soviet-American summit meeting, a Soviet vessel left <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> carrying four helicopters with potential military use, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sources said Monday. The reported shipment, due to arrive in <LOCATION> Corinto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, on Dec. 18, comes as the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is staging a substantial buildup in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> not far from base camps of the Contra rebels in southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. While some officials expressed concern about the potential military impact of the MI-17 helicopters, they said the Soviets are likely to contend the aircraft are for commercial purposes. Because such aircraft normally are sent to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> without weapons mounted on them, the delivery would not appear to contradict the reaffirmation Sunday by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that his country has ceased arms deliveries to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But the sources, who asked not to be identified, said the MI-17 has been used extensively by the Sandinista armed forces for carrying troops and as gunships. In the past, they said, MI-17's have been converted on arrival in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for military use against the Contras President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he does not challenge <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s assertions but has expressed concern about what he has descibed as a continuing flow of Soviet bloc weaponry through <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> At his news conference in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowldged that he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have `` big differences'' on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He said he would like <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to use his influence to `` facilitate democratic change'' in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. The sources said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> now have about 38 MI-17's in their inventory. The MI-17 is an advanced version of the MI-8 helicopter and is more easily adaptable than the MI-8 for use as a gunship. Since there are already many MI-17's in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, one official said the new shipment could not necessarily be considered a provocation. The official said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> already have enough MI-17's and described the additional helicopters as unnecessary. He added that the delivery probably had been in the planning stage for months and that it may have been a coincidence that the ship carrying the helicopters left <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> just before the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> summit. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, citing intelligence reports, said the shipment left <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> aboard the vessel <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilyich </PERSON>. The MI-17 delivery to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials see it, appears to be more closely related to the internal situation in that country than to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. National elections are set for Feb. 25 and the Sandinista government is angry that the Contra rebels continue to operate not only inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> but also remain deployed at base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and four other Central American presidents called in August for the demobilization of the rebels by this Tuesday, but that deadline will pass with the resistance forces still intact. The Contras, backed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, have pointed out that the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents specified that the demobilization must be `` voluntary'' and carried out only if the rebels can return safely to their homeland. Five weeks ago, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> suspended a truce that had been in effect for 19 months, accusing the rebels of engaging in terrorist activities. The Contras, who continue to receive non-lethal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, said the only offensive action during the truce period had been carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Aggravating the situation was the collapse on Nov. 21 of cease-fire talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> between the Sandinistas and the Contras.

 A federal appeals court on Monday upheld <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s agreement to hire and promote women and minorities in the white male-dominated Fire Department. In a 3-0 ruling, the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected a union claim that the plan violated the rights of white men by setting numerical goals for minority and female employment and by requiring the promotion of 33 minority firefighters. The agreement, approved in a consent decree by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> in June 1988, `` is fundamentally fair, adequate and reasonable,'' said the opinion by Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. The court noted the department had no blacks until 1955 and no women until 1987, and the city's hiring and promotional tests for firefighters had repeatedly been found discriminatory from 1970 to 1987. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said the decree met the standards for race - and sex-based remedies set by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>: a `` manifest imbalance'' between representation of groups in the Fire Department and the population, and the fashioning of a plan that does not unnecessarily hurt whites and males The decree, which ended 18 years of lawsuits by minorities and women, was challenged by Firefighters Union Local 798, with the support of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. As the litigation neared a climax, a swastika was found in the office of two minority firefighters in December 1987. <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> pronounced the department `` out of control'' and ordered top officials to enforce rules against racial and sexual harassment under threat of contempt of court. Shortly afterward, Fire Chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Phipps </PERSON> resigned. The appeals court upheld <PERSON> Patel </PERSON>'s order in Monday's ruling, saying there was `` ample evidence of foot-dragging'' by the department in enforcing its rules against harassment. When the decree on hiring and promotions was signed, the department had 225 minorities and seven women on its staff of 1,100. The plan sets long-term goals of 40 percent minorities and 10 percent women in the department, and goals of 55 percent minority hiring and 10 percent female hiring through 1994. The appeals court ordered the plan modified to eliminate the hiring standards before 1994 if the long-term goals were met by then. The plan also requires the city to prepare new, unbiased examinations for hiring and promotion, and to promote 33 minority firefighters to the rank of lieutenant. An additional 48 promotions are optional, of which 12 must be minorities. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> rejected the union's argument that the plan was discriminatory by requiring the promotion of minorities but not of whites. No evidence was presented of past discrimination against whites, he said.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief aide said Monday the crippled <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is unable to act and has lost its support. The aide, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, has been negotiating with with East German leaders about financial aid, in exchange for which <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wants assurances of free elections and economic reform. He also has been laying the groundwork for a Kohl visit to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this month, but no date has been set. <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Norddeutscher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio he assumes he will return to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this week to resume his talks, despite the resignation of the ruling party Politburo and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The party is `` now incapable of action, in a deep crisis'' and has `` lost the trust of its supporters, its members and the people in the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>,'' he said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has a `` responsibility to help in humanitarian areas ... regardless of the events'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he added.

<HEAD>Opposition, Humanitarian Groups Fearful in El Salvador</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The leftist political opposition and humanitarian groups labeled as subversive for working with the poor have been driven underground or out of the country by a climate of persecution. <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosin </PERSON>, the sole representative of the Los Angeles-based Medical Aid for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, left the country Monday after discovering her office was ransacked over the weekend. Neighbors said about 20 men in military uniforms entered it before dawn Saturday. For eight years, Medical Aid has distributed money for prosthetic devices, delivered donated medicines to hospitals and sent dozens of children to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for operations beyond the technical means of Salvadoran hospitals. Ms. <PERSON> Rosin </PERSON>, 35, had worked in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for two years and left reluctantly for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We had two little girls lined up for heart operations in the States. I do n't know what will happen to them now,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Friday said it will transfer its Salvadoran offices to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> `` for lack of guarantees.'' Officials found equipment and furniture at the main <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> offices smashed following fighting last week around the building, in the affluent neighborhood of <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION>. Army troops had occupied the offices, which administered <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> and refugee projects, after <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel were evacuated. When <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials returned, they found scrawled on the walls: `` <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> equals <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> equals Traitors.'' The letters stand for <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the rebel group that last month launched its biggest offensive of the 10-year-old civil war. The U.S.-backed government of rightist <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> responded by declaring a state of siege that suspended constitutional guarantees. Hundreds of people have been detained since, including two dozen foreigners who work with churches or humanitarian groups. Almost all the non-Salvadorans have been deported, although some remain jailed facing charges. Foreigners who work with the poor are called `` internationalists,'' and they are a favorite target of the right, which accuses them of supporting revolution. A flier signed `` Salvadoran air force,'' considered the most rightist branch of the armed forces, was found strewn on city streets over the weekend. `` With God, reason and might, we shall conquer,'' it said. `` Salvadoran patriot: You have every right to defend your life and your property. If in order to do this you have to kill <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> terrorists and their internationalist allies, do it.'' `` We are in the catacombs. There is no prospect for above-ground humanitarian work with the poor in the short or middle term,'' said <PERSON> Episcopalian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, whose church has for years done social, medical and educational work with displaced people and refugees. He commented in an interview in <LOCATION> Mariona </LOCATION> prison, where he and eight members of his church are jailed as alleged subversives. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has said the crackdown by the government and armed forces was `` absolutely appropriate.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has provided $ 4 billion in aid this decade to the Salvadoran government in the war, which has killed 71,000 people, 1,000 of them in the latest fighting. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> likened the raids and arrests to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. `` I'm not condoning it. But in times like these of great emotion and great anger, things like this happen. Even in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, with all its guarantees, it happened,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` There are a series of indications of a climate of persecution,'' said <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, auxiliary bishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, after Mass on Sunday. `` Not only against personnel of the Catholic church, but against many people who try to help the most humble and the most poor.'' `` It appears that the military authorities, in their quest to restore order, have adopted as their criteria the saying, ` Think the worst, and you'll be right,''' he said. The climate of war and fear has tinged even jokes. One goes like this: Two soldiers are patrolling the streets 10 minutes before the beginning of the nightly curfew. They pass a man walking quickly in the opposite direction. One soldier turns around and fatally shoots the man. `` Why'd you do that?'' asks his companion. `` I know that guy. He lives 20 minutes from here.''

<TEXT>
 The last obstacle between <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and sentencing was lifted Monday when a judge refused to set aside her tax evasion conviction. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, who is portrayed in advertisements as the queen of her luxury hotels, was convicted Aug. 30 of evading $ 1.2 million in federal taxes by charging personal expenses to her business empire. By denying a request to overturn the conviction and dismiss the charges, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> cleared the way for her Dec. 12 sentencing. The judge ruled that prosecutors did not use tainted evidence against Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s lawyers based their request on allegations that prosecutors improperly used the testimony she gave to grand juries in 1985. At the time, the state was investigating possible sales tax evasion by jewelers, furriers and other retailers. Because Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was granted immunity, prosecutors were legally barred from using the testimony in the later income tax case. `` The court is satisfied that the government's evidence used in the federal grand jury and at trial was derived from sources independent of Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s immunized testimony on unrelated matters,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said in a written decision. Her attorney, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON>, said he had not seen <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s decision and could not comment At sentencing, the 69-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> could receive punishment ranging from community service to 127 years in prison if <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> imposes consecutive sentences on 33 tax-related counts. She also could face more than $ 7 million in fines. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s 80-year-old husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, heads a $ 5 billion real estate and hotel empire. He was charged with his wife and the others but was found incompetent to stand trial.

<TEXT>
 A court affirmed Monday that a Palestinian facing charges of murder is also a suspect in the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, and it approved the seizure of evidence in a raid on his apartment. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>, 35, is believed to be the first suspect to face a court proceeding in connection with the bombing of the jumbo jet Dec. 21, 1988, over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, that killed 270 people. `` The court finds that <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> is suspected in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> of murder or as an accessory to murder,'' the brief District Court ruling said. Clothing seized in the raid `` can be presumed to carry importance for the investigation,'' it said. The court classified its hearing records as secret and ordered any evidence removed from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> to be returned when the investigation is completed. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>, listed in court documents as <PERSON> Abo </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>, appeared at a closed hearing Friday. A verdict in the case of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> and three other Palestinians is expected Dec. 21. Their trial ended Nov. 15 on charges of murder and attempted murder in four bombings in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> in 1985 and 1986. <PERSON> Jamila </PERSON> <PERSON> Mograbi </PERSON>, who is divorced from <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> but still lives with him, denied he was involved in the Pan Am bombing, but would not discuss the other charges. `` We are short of money. It's obvious that my husband is not some kind of terrorist, because terrorists have money,'' she told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> is a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group based in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> that rejects compromise with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and opposes <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s radical Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> is the group most often accused of the Pan Am attack. Ms. <PERSON> Mograbi </PERSON> said three Scottish detectives and seven Swedish officers searched the apartment last week for clothing traceable to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, virtually emptying the closets and filling 15 plastic bags, she said. Under Swedish law, evidence can not be taken for a foreign investigation, or removed from the country, unless a court authorizes it. Investigators are said to have identified clothing originating in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> from the suitcase they believe contained the bomb. They believe the bomb may have gone on an Air <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> flight to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 103 originated. The flight changed planes in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and was bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Mograbi </PERSON>, 28, said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> brought three sweaters and a pair of jeans from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> in October 1988. She said they were wholesale samples he intended to show retailers, with the idea of importing such clothing. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> was looking for a new business after his video store failed, she said, adding that he went to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> to recover from a stab wound suffered in a quarrel. Police arrested <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> in May, along with two of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mograbi </PERSON>'s brothers and a fourth Palestinian, in connection with the four bombings. `` Even if you are suspected of one crime, it does n't mean you committed another,'' she said in the interview Monday. According to court documents, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> in 1986 on a false Moroccan passport. Miss <PERSON> Mograbi </PERSON> said the couple has lived in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> for six years. Court records say <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, served in the Egyptian army, underwent military training in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, deserted the army and fled to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins in Pit Bull Murder Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the first case of its kind, the owner of a pit bull dog went on trial Monday in the murder of a toddler mauled after wandering into the dog's path while, prosecutors say, it was guarding 243 marijuana plants. Jury selection began in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> is charged with second-degree murder for the June 13, 1987, death of his 2-year-old neighbor, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, who died of severe blood loss after being attacked by the <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s pit bull named <PERSON> Willy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> also faces felony marijuana cultivation charges. According to the prosecutor and the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the trial marks the first time in this country that a pet owner has been charged with murder because of an animal's actions. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON> acknowledged there is no evidence of malice or intent to kill young <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, but said the prosecution is based on the theory of implied malice. That allows a murder conviction for someone whose actions show wanton disregard for human life. `` What we have is a guy who raises a dog that is bred for aggressiveness and to be a combatant,'' <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON> said during <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s arraignment two years ago. `` And, knowing the dog's propensity, he places him in an area accessible to all _ including children. During a search of <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s home, authorities said they found several publications on illegal dog fighting, and a dog-sized conditioning treadmill. A gag order was issued last month, barring both sides from discussing the case. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, said he and his wife had left <PERSON> James </PERSON> playing with new toy trucks on their back patio while they went shopping at garage sales. When they returned, the father said he found their son being `` torn apart'' by the pit bull after apparently wandering through an open gate and into the unfenced yard of their neighbor. The child never regained consciousness. At least 157 people have died from dog attacks nationwide in the past 10 years, 70 percent of them under the age of 10, according to the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. But of those cases, the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> said only one owner has been convicted of a major felony. <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnipseed </PERSON> of <LOCATION> De </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to five years in prison after three of his pit bulls killed a 4-year-old boy in 1987. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> has contended that he has been singled out because his dog attacked a child at a time when the breed was the center of considerable negative publicity. `` I think a murder rap is overdoing it by a lot,'' said <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadish </PERSON>, a law professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. `` If this is the highest form of crime, then what do we do with the hired killer or the serial rapist?'' <PERSON> Kadish </PERSON> and other lega experts have speculated that <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> was charged with second-degree murder in an effort to force him to plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter instead. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted. While <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> goes on trial, his dog, <PERSON> Willy </PERSON>, remains at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> animal shelter. He has not been destroyed because he is considered evidence in the case, and he is described as a friendly and affectionate dog. But shelter spokeswoman <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> nevertheless will be destroyed at the conclusion of the legal battle.

 The next summit meeting of five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents will be held in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> Dec. 10-12, sources close to President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said Monday. The meeting, which had been scheduled for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, probably will be in <LOCATION> Heredia </LOCATION>, nine miles from the capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, according to the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified. Plans to hold the summit in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> were canceled because <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> refused to go to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> suspended relations with <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> last week after two planes, allegedly smuggling arms from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, were found in Salvadoran territory. One crashed and the four crewmen perished, and the other was burned by its crew at a landing strip because the craft was out of fuel, according to Salvadoran officials. The presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, at their meeting last August in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, agreed to demobilize the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, by Dec. 5. Next week's meeting is supposed to review the relocation of the Contras, thousands of whom live in camps across the border in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Most of the Contras, who have been fighting the Sandinista government for eight years, refuse to disband and be relocated until after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s elections, scheduled for February. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who had insisted that the meeting be held in his country, relented over the weekend and agreed to meet in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, the sources reported. They said there were offers to hold the summit in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> insisted it be held in the region. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> has said all the presidents except <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> agreed on <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> as a replacement site for <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. `` All the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign ministers are pressuring that the summit be held in a hotel with conveniences, not only for the presidents, but also for the press,'' said a Nicaraguan diplomat who asked not to be identified.

<TEXT>
 The previously secret diary of writer and social critic H.L. <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON> reveals virulent anti-Semitism, racism and pro-Nazi leanings, shocking even the sympathetic <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON> scholar who edited it. The diary, type-written on 2,100 pages from 1930 to 1948, was sealed on <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON>'s instructions for 25 years after his death in 1956. The -LRB- <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> -RRB- Evening Sun, where <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON> once worked, published excerpts Monday. On the subject of Jews, <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON> wrote in December 1943 that the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> had decided against admitting any more Jewish members after the only one on its rolls died. `` There is no other Jew in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> who seems suitable,'' he said. Of blacks, he wrote in September 1943, `` ... it is impossible to talk anything resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman. They are all essentially child-like, and even hard experience does not teach them anything.'' On Oct. 24, 1945, he wrote that `` the course of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in World War II ... was dishonest, dishonorable and ignominious, and the Sunpapers, in supporting <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>'s foreign policy, shared in this disgrace.'' The book, `` The Diary of H.L. <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON>,'' was edited by <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON> scholar <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fecher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and published by <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knopf </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON> is revered by many writers and journalists for his erudite writing and often brilliant social and political criticism. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has a library named in his honor and The -LRB- <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun bestows an annual writing award named for him. He spent 40 years at The Evening Sun, edited the Smart Set and the American Mercury magazines, wrote dozens of books, and contributed to numerous other publications. `` His feelings about World War II are incredible in a man of his intelligence, knowledge and perception,'' <PERSON> Fecher </PERSON> wrote in his introduction to the book. `` He seems to have had no conception at all of what a German-Japanese victory would have meant to the civilized world, or to the liberties that he himself so cherished.'' <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON>'s attitude toward blacks `` was a curious mingling of total egalitarianism ... and patronizing superiority,'' <PERSON> Fecher </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON> regularly published black writers in American Mercury; persuaded his publisher, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knopf </PERSON>, to publish their books; was cordial to black journalists, and had his portrait painted by a black artist. The last article he wrote for The Evening Sun in 1948 attacked segregation laws in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. But the diary reveals <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON>'s `` deeply ingrained conviction that black people were by their very nature inferior to white,'' <PERSON> Fecher </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Fecher </PERSON> said the writer's own words may permanently diminish his reputation. `` Like everybody else who is going to read it, I was shocked,'' said <PERSON> Fecher </PERSON>, 72. `` It has tempered my admiration for <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON> and made me aware of weaknesses I had not known.'' <PERSON> Fecher </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON> against charges of anti-Semitism in his 1978 book, `` Mencken: A Study of His Thought.'' `` Today I would be much less ready to take such a stand. Let it be said at once, clearly and unequivocally: <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON> was an anti-Semite,'' wrote <PERSON> Fecher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON>'s diary tells of his pleasure that a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> resort he enjoyed visiting excludes Jews, and expresses annoyance when <PERSON> Jews </PERSON> moved into his neighborhood. His closest associates at the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> newspapers revered his memory, but he dismisses virtually all of them as `` third raters,'' `` non-entities'' and worse. `` The diaries are almost sick. I mean he hated everybody,'' said <PERSON> Gwinn </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, a former editor and columnist on The Evening Sun whose father, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, was a long-time <ORGANIZATION> Sunpapers </ORGANIZATION> editor and friend of <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON>'s. In the diary, <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON> dismisses <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> as `` a time-server with no more principles than a privy rat.'' `` One of the things that really hurts ... is that after <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON> had his stroke, my father went to see him every week, sat with him and talked with him,'' <PERSON> Gwinn </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economists and business leaders expressed general support Monday for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s actions at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit to support Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` perestroika'' restructuring efforts `` <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> is a long-run affair with all kinds of great promise,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` One should be cautious, but there are great hopes and optimism that a new era is dawning.'' <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON>, chief executive of the agricultural giant, <ORGANIZATION> Archer-Daniels-Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said that `` unleashing the forces of free-enterprise ca n't be anything but beneficial.'' The analysts were asked their views of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statements and actions of recent days in connection with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to revamp an ailing economy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lent encouragement to that effort. But during a news conference in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> Monday following his briefing of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said chances were `` slim and none'' that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would be invited to join the world's seven richest countries at their economic summit meeting next July. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Soviets need to do much more to reform their government-controlled economic system before they could be considered for inclusion in the annual economic summits attended by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The next meeting is scheduled for early July in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had sent a letter to the world leaders at last summer's meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, asking to be included in the annual talks But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he did not think it likely that the Soviets would be participating in next year's summit, saying he saw `` two chances _ slim and none _ for that particular meeting.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that what was most important now was for Communist countries trying to transform their economies to get expertise in how market-based systems work. `` We have got to understand -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s -RRB- dilemma. They have not had a market economy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It is important that not just the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but other countries in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> understand the market economies, understand the dynamism of the economic systems that join -LRB- the seven economic summit -RRB- countries together.'' The president announced several initiatives at his weekend meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> aimed at helping to integrate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the world economy. He pledged to remove high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariffs levied on Soviet imports once the Soviets approve legislation allowing free emigration. He also promised to support observer status for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 97-member international organization that governs world trade. Observer status would not automatically entitle the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to various favorable trade concessions granted full <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> members, but it would provide Soviet officials with first-hand knowledge of the deliberations occurring in the organization. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had previously opposed Soviet requests for observer status, maintaining that the Soviet system was incompatible with <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>'s free-trade principles. <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to lower tariffs on Soviet goods following approval of the liberalized emigration law should foster reciprocal actions by the Soviets to purchase more American goods, including farm products. Before the farm trade restrictions imposed by then-President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in retaliation for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, American farmers supplied 70 percent of the agricultural products imported by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the Soviet agricultural market is now 45 percent. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, said that it was essential for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to provide some specific proposals to bolster the reforms <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is trying to institute in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` If perestroika fails, it is going to fail because of economics,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. `` We have much to lose by the Russians failing. We should be helping them any way we can.''

 The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> has grabbed more than 100,000 readers a day in its first two months of publication, but has n't drawn readers away from the established <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, executives of the two newspapers said Monday. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> officials sounded almost grateful to the upstart Sun, which is the newest newspaper in the country. `` I do firmly believe that the <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON> is a much better newspaper today than it was a year ago,'' <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penniman </PERSON> IV, publisher of the <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON> and vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Pulitzer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said at an annual editors meeting. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipman </PERSON>, managing editor of the <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON>, said the new competition has accelerated changes that were in the works at the 111-year-old newspaper and given it a jolt of adrenalin. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> feels 10 years younger. And we're going to continue feeling young and being useful and still be a lot of fun,'' he said. The Sun, which debuted Sept. 25, has been averaging about 107,000 circulation for its first two months, while the <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON>'s circulation has remained steady at 378,000 daily and 565,000 on Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>'s Saturday newspaper has increased its circulation about 3 percent to 348,000 since the Sun began appearing with an expanded Saturday paper that costs $ 1 compared to 25 cents for the Saturday Post-Dispatch. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the Sun's editor-in-chief and chairman of its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected the Sun to turn a profit by the end of 1990. However, he said profits wo n't be as high as originally projected because the newspaper is attracting more home subscribers and fewer newsstand buyers than expected. Home subscribers pay less. Ingersoll brushed aside talk of a `` newspaper war'' in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` We look on it as a competition, which is something different than a war,'' he said. Before the debut of the Sun, the Post-Dispatch had been without competition since the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe-Democrat </ORGANIZATION> folded in Oct. 1986.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> chided President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at their <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit for not granting visas to thousands of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> citizens who want to live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a Soviet spokesman said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said on the flight back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raised the human rights issue by giving <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a list of divided spouses the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claims are separated by Soviet refusal to grant one or the other an exit visa. Presentation of such lists, thousands of names long until recently, has been a ritual at high-level meetings for years. The lists have shrunk steadily under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, however, and only a few people are on the latest one. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presented it during talks on the Soviet cruise ship <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, `` We had a very long list of Soviet citizens who want to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and ca n't get visas, which is a little bit against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters later he was joking about the Soviets giving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a list, but said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did respond to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presentation by reminding <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that thousands of Soviets seeking visas line up outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> every day. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, inundated by the flood of people now being allowed to emigrate, has drastically limited the number given refugee status as victims of persecution and expects to turn away 200,000 in the next year. Soviet officials have estimated 4-5 million citizens will leave the country under a new law permitting the departure of most people who want to leave. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had offered to begin negotiations on a trade agreement without waiting for congressional approval of most-favored-nation status, which the Soviets have been denieed because they prevented free emigration. He said the Soviet side reacted `` very favorably'' to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for halting production of binary chemical weapons <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> called it an important initiative, `` one step in the right direction'' toward a comprehensive chemical weapons ban. To illustrate Soviet concern about being surrounded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a classified map showing the American bases that ring Soviet territory, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. The Kremlin is preparing to publish more information about its military spending and production, he said. `` We promised under no circumstances ever to attack the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he added, and feel <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` does n't need all this military hardware.''

 Militiamen allied with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> shelled two south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> towns Monday, and in the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters drove <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> from three villages in house-to-house combat, police said. Police said at least 15 people were killed and 48 wounded in the two flareups. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, is comprised of pro-Iranian fundamentalists. Mainstream Amal is allied with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The two Shiite Moslem factions long have vied for control of the 1.2 million Shiites, the largest sect among <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 4 million population. In <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, an Arab League commitee accused Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> of blocking a settlement of the 14-year-old Lebanese civil war, but urged the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> commander and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to avoid a new battle. President <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> said Monday he was delaying for a few days any decisive action to evict <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from the presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> appeal came after a two-day meeting of its committee on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejects a peace plan worked out at <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, in October and approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. He also says <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s election by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last month was unconstitutional. His 20,000 Christian army troopers fought a six-month artillery war with the 40,000 Syrian soldiers stationed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which ended in September with a truce arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The Syrians moved in additional troops, tanks and heavy artillery, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and former colonial power <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> urged <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to show moderation and counseled dialogue to resolve the crisis. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> messaged Syrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON> reiterating <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s support for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and denouncing `` <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s ruffianism,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. A police spokesman said five people were killed and 12 wounded in a seven-hour artillery barrage Monday against the town of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rumman </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militia that helps <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> patrol the `` security zone'' just north of its border with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Six people were wounded in shelling of neighboring <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>, police said. They said all casualties were civilians in the two towns, which have a combined population of 140,000. It was the third day militia gunners shelled the towns. Total casualties there since Saturday stood at eight killed, 38 wounded. Militia radio Voice of the South broadcast a statement saying the shelling was a response to two <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla assaults that killed three militiamen and wounded five. <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, whose Amal militia controls the towns, threatened to bombard northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if shelling continued. He urged <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to seek an `` urgent debate by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of the ongoing massacre in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' A Foreign Ministry statement said <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> reserved the right to ask a council debate on `` the brutal attacks by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its surrogates in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> set up the zone in 1985, when it withdrew the bulk of its forces after occupying <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for three years. The area varies in depth from 6 to 10 miles and is meant to serve as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla raids. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> fought <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Sohmor </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yohmor </LOCATION> in the western sector of the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, north of the security zone. Police said at least 10 people were killed and 30 wounded in nine hours of fighting from house to house that ended with <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> being driven from the two villages. No breakdown of killed or wounded was available. The fighting later spread to <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION>. Police said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters ousted <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s garrison from the town, provincial capital of the western <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION>, in four hours of street battles. A police spokesman said about 50 Syrian soldiers based in <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION> made no move to help their <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> allies. He said among the wounded were <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s security chief in the western <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Khishin </PERSON>, and the militia's military commander of <LOCATION> Sohmor </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>. At least 535 people were killed and 1,490 wounded in previous battles between the two militias since May 1987, according to police figures.

<HEAD>Skinner Sees High Drug Use In Transportation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> predicted Monday that random drug testing will reveal an `` alarming amount of drug usage'' among people responsible for the safety of land, air and sea transportation. Rules begin going into effect in two weeks that require random and other drug tests for millions of airline, railroad, mass transit, bus company, boat, trucking company and pipeline employees. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that where court orders do not stop the testing, companies must comply with the new rule. Several suits have been filed by workers to stop the federally imposed program. Startup dates for the testing vary by modes of transportation. The secretary said he has set up a group in his office to monitor progress of the testing, while agencies dealing with aviation, railroads and other modes would each oversee industries they cover. `` Once they begin the testing, I think we'll see an alarming amount of drug use and positive testing in safety-related jobs,'' said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> at a session with reporters. He said he expects the results to justify the high priority the administration has given the program. Random drug tests in the military showed high drug use in the first few months, he said. Ten percent of tested <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel showed positive, but the incidence has since dropped to 2 percent because of the testing, he said. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the government would not be lenient with companies that do not make an effort to begin drug-testing programs. `` I do n't want to be unfair,'' he said, but `` the time has come where we've got to move forward on this testing. We're not going to sit here and tell somebody who is required by law or regulation to conduct the test that they can just wait until they are ready.'' Possible action against employers, including civil penalties or withholding of federal funds, varies by transportation modes. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that `` with rare exception'' airlines have submitted drug-testing plans that have been approved. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> extended the August deadline after several smaller airlines failed to submit their programs. The secretary said he had been told by more than one mass transit operator to expect high rates of drug usage when the testing begins, possibly significantly higher than the 10 percent found in the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Results should vary in different parts of the country and in different modes of transportation, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, but added, `` I know it's a major problem all over this country.'' Asked what effect high drug use might have on the continuation of transportation services, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, `` If the percentages were 40 percent, it would be devastating. If it were 5 percent, they could probably work their way through it.''

 Sheet and rill erosion on cropland decreased by a half ton per acre nationwide between 1982 and 1987, dropping from 4.3 tons to 3.8 tons per acre a year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. However, wind erosion on cropland increased 0.1 ton per acre to 3.3 tons per acre a year, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inventory </ORGANIZATION> report from the department's soil conservation service. According to the data, sheet and rill erosion nationwide totals 1.6 billion tons per year and wind erosion 1.4 billion tons annually. The survey `` reveals impressive gains for soil conservation,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based non-profit environmental research and publishing organization. But the research also shows that soil erosion is still a serious problem, it said in a statement released Monday. `` From everything we know about land use in the mid-1970s, erosion conditions worsened with the onset of the export boom,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, vice president of the center. He said analysis of the survey data may show that the improvement in erosion control is due substantially to massive idling of cropland under government programs between 1984 and 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the report does not reflect the work under way on about 140 million acres of highly erodible land as part of the conservation provisions of the 1985 farm law. Rural nonfederal land now totals 1.4 billion acres. Of this 422.8 million acres are cropland, 401.7 million acres are rangeland, 394.4 million acres are forestland and 59.9 million aces are in minor land uses, the survey says.

 East Germans outraged by the corruption of ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders tried to storm secret police offices Monday to make certain evidence for criminal trials is not removed. Prosecutors blocked access by the former officials to evidence that could be used against them in the widening corruption investigation. State television showed pictures of people joining police at luxurious government guest houses and at warehouses in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION> to block any efforts to remove documents. Officials appealed for calm as people tried to force their way into secret police offices in <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, where about 200,000 people attended a rally calling for German unification, 30 demonstrators were allowed inside the secret police headquarters, including opposition leader <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the group was let in `` after massive demands of demonstrators who had surrounded the building.'' It said the protesters presented their grievances and departed but 200 other demonstrators who refused to leave were permitted inside later to tour the building. Parts of the building were sealed off to prevent documents from being smuggled out and <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON> said citizens would take part in making sure the papers remained there. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwanitz </PERSON>, new chief of national security, ordered flights to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> halted because of reports that sensitive material was being smuggled to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally, whose leader, <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, has rejected reform. Officials said there was no proof documents were being sent there. Opposition sources said earlier that important documents were taken from party headquarters to <LOCATION> Schoenfeld </LOCATION> airport for flights to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, who emerged as the leading political figure one day after the entire <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership resigned, was not in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He led a three-member delegation to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> At the huge <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> rally, the crowd applauded and cheered as speakers called for a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Demonstrators waved dozens of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> flags in front of the secret police headquarters. One flag was draped over a surveillance camera mounted outside the headquarters. It was the third week that calls for German reunification dominated the Monday night <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> protests, and the demands were more pronounced than ever. ADN reported 60,000 people rallied in <LOCATION> Karl-Marx-Stadt </LOCATION>, 10,000 in <LOCATION> Schwerin </LOCATION> and tens of thousands in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated at a special session of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> that a single <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> loyal to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would satisfy both the German yearning for unity and a nation's right to self-determination, but added later to reporters: `` We are not trying to accelerate the process. It's better to let things move on their own.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, one of four parties allied with the Communists, said they were cutting those ties, East German television reported. It said they demanded that <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, who resigned as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief Sunday along with the Politburo, also give up the largely ceremonial post of president. <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the party's interim governing committee, a reform-minded group of 25 people, appealed for calm to avoid `` anarchy and chaos.'' `` The committee members have been troubled to learn of indications of people taking the law into their own hands and trying to forcefully enter public buildings,'' she said in a statement read to reporters in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Flights have been prohibited, as part of the anti-corruption crackdown, in the area of a huge depot stocked with weapons the ousted leaders were selling in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON>, a ranking former official who ran the weapons operation, has fled the country. The government said late Monday it was enlisting its embassies in an international search for him. Officials in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> might be there. In the first official cooperation between the government and opposition, a joint commission was formed to investigate corruption under <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who led the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for 18 years until <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> replaced him in October. Government spokesman <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> promised the joint commission would root out all cases of `` corruption and misuse of office.''' Two former members of the Politburo have been imprisoned as a result of anti-corruption investigations and 12 former leaders have been expelled from the party. Opposition members urged citizens during a news conference Monday to `` block coverup attempts and illegal removals'' of documents and other items. <PERSON> Lothar </PERSON> <PERSON> Scharsich </PERSON>, spokesman for the opposition group <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION>, also pleaded for `` no violence.'' In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the chief aide to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said the East German party was `` incapable of acting'' and had `` totally lost the trust of its supporters, its members and the people.'' <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> has been negotiating with with East German leaders on financial aid, in exchange for which <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> demands free elections and economic reform, and laying the groundwork for a visit by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 Idealistic military officers who are among the nation's most talented have tried repeatedly to depose the president they helped elevate to power in February 1986. They organized the <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 to oppose corruption in the military under the late President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was driven into exile and replaced by <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Of six coup attempts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, they are known to have plotted those in November 1986, August 1987 and the past weekend. The `` RAM Boys,'' as they are known here, have come to believe her administration represents the same nepotism, and corruption as the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> government. On Saturday, they issued a manifesto demanding that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> resign to open the way for a referendum on what form the archipelago's government should take. It accused her of pursuing the ruinous policies of her predecessors and of not initiating social and economic reform. The RAM officers have claimed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> favors leftists and coddles <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels while ignoring the interests of the armed forces. RAM emerged when officers unfurled a banner during graduation exercises at the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> saying `` We Belong.'' They were described as `` Born Again Soldiers,'' committed to restoring discipline and professionalism. Members include some of the best officers, including former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, a charismatic figure who led the coup attempt in August 1987 and is believed to be a leader of this one. Their political philosophy seems not unlike that of Italian fascists in the 1920s: Society should exchange hurly-burly politics for an orderly, disciplined approach to solving national problems. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> prefers consultation and public debate that produces a consensus she can accept. She tends to rely heavily on people whose primary qualification is loyalty to her or her husband, <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was shot to death when he returned from self-imposed exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a young RAM lieutenant, appeared on a commandeered television station during the August 1987 coup attempt to proclaim his movement's goals. He said <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> society suffered from `` too much politics'' _ endless debate without resolution. The RAM clique became associated with <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, then defense minister, because of mutual opposition to Gen. <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ver </PERSON>, military chief of staff to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Ver, a distant relative of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, had circumvented the chain of command by his relationship with the president and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, and underminded <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>'s position as defense chief. He had solidified his power by appointing supporters to senior commands, regardless of merit, so <ORGANIZATION> RAM </ORGANIZATION> officers looked to <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>. In 1985, as the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> administration weakened, RAM officers began plotting to replace his government with a junta that would impose discipline and order on a chaotic society. RAM sources say they planned a coup for late 1985, but delayed it after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> called a presidential election for February 1986. When <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> used fraud to steal the election from Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> RAM </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying the `` will of the people'' had been foiled. Plans were made for a coup, in which soldiers in rubber boats would cross the <LOCATION> Pasig </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and storm the presidential palace, but Ver learned of the plot and ordered <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> and others arrested. The defense minister found out and withdrew to military headquarters in <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aguinaldo </LOCATION> with his `` boys'' and declared opposition to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. His declaration did not win over enough units to assure success, so <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> and Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, then deputy chief of staff, appealed to Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON> and opposition groups. Hundreds of thousands of people heeded the cardinal's call to fill the streets and protect the mutineers. The price was a declaration from the military leaders of support for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Members of RAM always have felt they were denied power that was rightfully theirs. They risked careers, families and lives to oust <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, but Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and her advisers, many of them anti-military, got the rewards.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Study Reveals Inconsistency In FAA Exemptions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government has granted hundreds of airline pilots medical exemptions to fly but has not used similar exemptions to allow pilots to fly past the mandatory retirement age of 60, a congressional study released Monday said. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who released the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study, said the study reveals an inconsistency in <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rules that he said have kept some of the most qualified and experienced pilots from operating large commercial airliners The report says the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> granted 1,301 exemptions to requirements for medical certificates 1960 through 1988. It said that among the 40,000 active air transport pilots, 605 now have `` special issuance'' medical certificates for alcoholism and 104 for cardiovascular conditions. `` Allowing such pilots to continue flying, but excluding a 60-year-old pilot in perfect health, clearly does not make sense,'' said <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging. The report said none of 67 petitions by 418 pilots asking for exemptions for pilots over 60 has been granted by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, which has said it adopted the rule for safety. Some of the applications are still pending. Pilots over 60 can fly commercial jets with fewer than 30 passengers and a payload under 7,500 pounds but must retire as captains or copilots of large airliners. <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> should reconsider the basis for its age-60 rule, which went into effect in 1959 and has been challenged by pilot groups and others over the years. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, which is <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm, summarized legal challenges to the rule, legislative efforts and the position of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and pilots but made no recommendation. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, representing pilots, earlier opposed the rule but since 1980 has backed the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> position, saying there has been no study that provides a way of determining which pilots over 60 are fit to fly safely. Opponents of the rule include the <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

 More than 150,000 demonstrators chanting `` They must go!'' rejected the new Communist-dominated government Monday and demanded free elections in a roaring show of support for the opposition. Also on Monday, thousands of tourists from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> freely visited the West for the first time in decades after the government lifted most travel restrictions. Demonstrators massed in central Wenceslas Square for the first time since Nov. 27, when a nationwide general strike forced the government to grant historic concessions. That demonstration capped 11 straight days of rallies in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Monday's demonstrators waved red, white and blue national flags and applauded opposition demands for elections by July and a second general strike on Dec. 11 if there is no new government by Sunday. `` Resign! Resign!'' they chanted. The turnout at the rally and smaller ones elsewhere was a clear signal to the government that the opposition has massive popular support for its demands for real democracy. They were protesting the new coalition government named Sunday, which brought only five non-Communists into the 21-member Cabinet and left Communists in control of all key ministries. Thirteen were holdovers from the previous Communist Cabinet. In an indication the government may respond to demands for new ministers, First Deputy Premier <PERSON> Bohumil </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> met with two opposition representatives to negotiate a new meeting with Communist Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> later this week. <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitra </PERSON>, the premier of the <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION> republican government, asked for more time to consider changes at the republic level, postponing an announcement originally scheduled for Monday night. The governments of the Czech and Slovak republics control key areas such as justice and education in their respective regions. Eleven of the 17 ministers under <PERSON> Pitra </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION> have submitted their resignations, including the unpopular ministers of education and justice, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. A parliamentary commission reported on its investigation into police brutality against student demonstrators on Nov. 17. It concluded that police used inappropriate force and seriously injured peaceful demonstrators. It said some police on duty then may face charges of assault and abuse of office. According to <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, the report blamed `` high political figures'' for the repression, which `` was one of the decisive reasons'' for subsequent mass protests. CTK listed no names. The hourlong <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> rally, broadcast live on state radio and television, was a triumphant show of national unity in the fight for democracy. That unity was symbolized at the end, when protest singer <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryl </PERSON>, who has lived in exile in the West for years, and <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gott </PERSON>, the nation's best-known officially sanctioned pop singer, led the singing of the national anthem. The people loudly cheered Civic Forum spokesman <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Maly </PERSON> when he announced that the opposition hoped to field its own candidates in elections. `` Thanks for your help and support!'' <PERSON> Maly </PERSON> shouted. `` We need it now more than ever.'' `` That's it! That's it!'' the crowd chanted back in a roaring show of support for Civic Forum, the nation's leading opposition movement, and its counterpart in <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>, called <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> has promised `` radical changes'' with the new government but has given no specific pledge of free elections, which top Communists said last week were likely within a year. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Pleskot </PERSON>, a spokesman for workers' strike committees, told the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> rally official trade unions had lost the trust of people, and said it was time to set up independent ones. At least 50,000 people rallied in the Slovak capital <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> to express anger with the new government. No rally had been planned in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, `` but the government sent us this irritation,'' actor <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Knazko </PERSON>, a key figure in the popular uprising against <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule, told the crowd. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> also reported protest rallies in the Bohemian city of <LOCATION> Usti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> nad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Labem </LOCATION> to the north, <LOCATION> Gottwaldov </LOCATION> to the east and <LOCATION> Ostrova </LOCATION> on the Polish border. The <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> rally was the first in the capital since Civic Forum staged a hugely successful general strike on Nov. 27. TV news said Monday almost 75 percent of the work force observed the two-hour stoppage or showed solidarity with it. On Nov. 28, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> agreed to relinquish the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 41-year monopoly on power and form a coalition government The party's leading role in society was removed from the constitution by a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last Wednesday. But the new government named Sunday disappointed those who wanted the Communists to surrender more control. `` We feel disappointed and cheated,'' said <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedlacek </PERSON>, a representative of striking students. The tens of thousands of students on strike nationwide decided Monday to prolong their two-week sit-in to protest the new government. Artists, theaters and galleries planned to strike until Dec. 11. `` The government does n't understand the situation fully,'' <PERSON> Sedlacek </PERSON> told the cheering crowd at Wenceslas Square. `` We want other changes.'' Civic Forum's <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Lis </PERSON> demanded the truth about the 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that crushed reform in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, and demanded the names of the leaders who asked the troops in. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the four other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations that invaded <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968 condemned that action Monday. Lis demanded that ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and other hard-liners associated with the post-1968 crackdown surrender their last political functions as parliamentary deputies. `` They must go! They must go!'' the crowd intoned.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>, wife of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>, has resigned as head of a highly touted <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> anti-drug program in a dispute over its fund-raising and spending practices. Ms. Sessions said her abrupt departure from the `` Join the Move'' project a month ago also followed complaints that telephone solicitors had used the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> chief's name to court donations. `` I just could n't be associated with that,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American-Statesman </ORGANIZATION>. `` I did n't get real accountability from them. So I got out.'' Officials of the program, sponsored by the Austin-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- DPSOA -RRB-, said there was no wrongdoing. `` She may have some particular disagreements with some of the things that the association is doing, but I think overall our goals are positive,'' said <ORGANIZATION> DPSOA </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>. The DPSOA was targeted four months ago in a controversy over phone fund raising by police groups. State Rep. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, an advocate of tighter restrictions on phone solicitors, said Ms. Sessions' complaints will rekindle the issue. Ms. Sessions expressed concern over fund-raising tactics by the DPSOA, which hired an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> firm to sell boxes of spices, jellies and sauces, with a portion of the royalties to go to `` Join the Move.'' `` I said from the very first that I did n't think that selling spices was the way to raise money for an anti-drug program,'' Ms. Sessions said. She also raised questions about how wisely the proceeds were being spent. <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said he was unaware of any problem. Spending is closely monitored by <ORGANIZATION> DPSOA </ORGANIZATION> officials, he said. Ms. Sessions also said friends complained that they had been asked for donations for the anti-drug project by callers who mentioned that she was the wife of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director. `` From the very beginning ... I asked that they not do anything like that _ my husband's position was not to be exploited,'' she said. One of those who got a sales call was the Sessions' son, who lives in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, she said. <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> DPSOA </ORGANIZATION> closely monitors its phone solicitations, and that callers were instructed not to mention the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> or say the food products were endorsed by Ms. Sessions.

 Security considerations convinced the government not to investigate and try two prominent Palestinians identified as uprising leaders by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> legislator and court documents, officials said Monday. <PERSON> Tzahi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanegbi </PERSON>, the legislator, alleged in a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal that philosophy professor <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON> and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyash </PERSON>, handled uprising funds and wrote leaflets urging escalation of the 2-year-old rebellion. <LOCATION> Hanegbi </LOCATION>, of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, quoted documents submitted to a military court at <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> in May that called <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON> a paymaster of the uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, responsible for distributing <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> funds and publishing uprising literature. He claimed <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyash </PERSON> represented <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla group of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief, in the underground Unified National Leadership of the Uprising and was responsible for several leaflets, army radio reported. Neither has been charged and <LOCATION> Hanegbi </LOCATION> demanded both men be tried, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Nili </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> of the state attorney's office attributed the decision not to investigate <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyash </PERSON> to `` professional considerations,'' <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> and the radio reported. She said Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> and other officials bore those considerations in mind, according to the reports. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said the security reasons remained secret but might be revealed if the court requested it. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyash </PERSON> said in a telephone interview: `` I would love to know and understand what these considerations are, but I'm not involved directly in these things, so I do n't see I should worry.'' He said <PERSON> Hanegbi </PERSON>'s appeal contained `` false and fake allegations,'' and the journalist declared: `` I think that, if the legal system in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> possesses information on security violations, they wo n't hesitate to ask us for interrogation. I have been interrogated many times, whenever they suspect something against security.'' <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON> characterized <LOCATION> Hanegbi </LOCATION>'s allegations as `` vague and circumstantial.'' He denied committing offenses or having knowledge of what the Israeli considerations were. `` Regarding secret security reasons, one is always at a loss concerning secret files of prosecutors,'' he said. `` One can never really tell what they have or do not have. `` I'm glad ... of not being investigated or put on trial. On the other hand, I'm also quite prepared to face trial and to put forward my case and to defend myself using all the legal methods at my disposal.'' Some Arab observers have speculated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> saw the two as possible candidates in its plan for Palestinians in the territories to elect delegates to negotiate interim autonomy, and therefore was hesistant to investigate them. Both the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> were paralyzed Monday by the second day of a general strike called because of an Israeli army attack on a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> gang in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. On Friday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers killed four members of a group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> claims the group has killed 16 Palestinians as alleged informers. The number of alleged collaborators slain by other Palestinians since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, rose to 155 on Monday with the death of <LOCATION> Mabrouka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Akra </LOCATION> in a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> hospital. Masked assailants stabbed the 55-year-old woman to death, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, at least nine Palestinians were reported shot and wounded by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the Sheik Radwan neighborhood, hospital officials said. An Arab journalist said protests began after residents learned <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Atti </PERSON>, 25, committed suicide in a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> prison Monday. He was arrested Oct. 10 on suspicion of trying to run over an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a civilian. At <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, 17-year-old <PERSON> Hussam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zant </PERSON> died of a gunshot wound to the eye suffered in a clash with soldiers Nov. 7 in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, doctors reported. His death brought to 625 the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis in the uprising. Forty-three Israelis have died.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and four other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations that invaded <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968 to crush a reform movement condemned their action on Monday. For the first time, the leaders of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> said jointly that sending in troops constitituted `` interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and must be condemned,'' according to a statement read on TV and carried by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. In a separate statement, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> called the Soviet-led invasion `` unfounded'' and `` erroneous.'' It noted that <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> condemned it earlier. The invasion used tanks to crush the `` Prague Spring'' reforms of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who was ousted as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. In the past two weeks, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> has re-emerged in the pro-democracy movement sweeping <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviet and Czechoslovak governments will begin talks on possible reduction of Soviet troops still based in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The statements came at the end of a <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and its Western foe, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, will someday become political instead of military alliances. Monday's announcements came a day after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. For months, following momentous political change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, all the signers of Monday's announcement except the Soviets condemned the invasion of their ally. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, still run by hard-liner <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, was not included in Monday's statement, but <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> did not take part in the invasion The statement said, `` Interrupting the process of democratic renewal in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, these unjustified actions had long-term negative consequences. History proved that it is extremely important, even in the most complex international situations, to use political means for the settling of any problem, to strongly observe principles of sovereignty, independence and non-interference in internal affairs in relations between states, in line with the principles of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact.'' The Soviet announcement likened the situation in 1968 to the current political upheaval in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, where demonstrations and a general strike have forced leadership changes. The Soviet statement called this a natural process of self-reassessment. It said the Soviet leadership supported one side in the internal dispute of 1968 and `` the justification for such an unbalanced, inadequate approach, an interference in the affairs of a friendly country, was then viewed in an acute East-West confrontation.'' `` We share the view of the Presidium of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and the Czechoslovak government that the entrance of the armies of five socialist countries into Czechoslovak territory in 1968 was unfounded, and that that decision, in the light of all the presently known facts, was erroneous,'' the Soviet government announcement said. The invasion stamped out reforms and restored a Moscow-aligned government of hard-liners. The late <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, then the Soviet leader, cited the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s `` sacred duty'' to protect socialism wherever it was threatened. <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> quit the alliance to protest the invasion and has remained isolated. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also met separately with Czechoslovak Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, and `` the question of the terms on which Soviet troops stay in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> came up for discussion.'' The question was referred to the two nations' foreign ministries. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>' report implied Soviet readiness to remove some troops, saying, `` reduction of armed forces and armaments on condition of maintaining <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> balance ... is the indispensable guarantee of stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The Tass report on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders indicated he said the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> `` can contribute to the strengthening of <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> security as political alliances.'' The official summary pointedly avoided any reference to their status now as military alliances. In a time of momentous political change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, four of the seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations have replaced staunch Communists with more reform-minded leaders this year, including non-communist Polish Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. On Monday, more than 150,000 people rallied in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Monday to demand the resignation of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s government. Further meetings at the Kremlin Monday and Tuesday indicate more developments may be in the offing. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met Monday with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s Stalinist leader and the only East European leader to resist the wave of reform sweeping the Communist bloc. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said they had a frank exchange regarding socialist construction. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also met with East German Prime Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> on Monday and was expected to meet Tuesday with West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> to discuss Soviet resistance to calls for possible reunification of the two Germanys. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> the Soviets see <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as an important guarantor of peace and stability in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s longtime leader, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, was ousted Oct. 18 after thousands of citizens fled West and others staged mass protests for reforms. <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> but was forced on Sunday to resign as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, though he remains president. <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> replaced ousted Bulgarian party chief <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> on Nov. 10, and <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> replaced Czechoslovak leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> on Nov. 24 after pro-democracy demonstrations. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> met with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> Monday.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, ousted in disgrace as <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader after the Soviet-led invasion in 1968, praised his countrymen's struggle for democracy and said, `` You can not suppress an idea.'' <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> broadcast on Monday an interview with <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>. The 67-year-old leader of the `` Prague Spring'' reforms said, `` An idea is going to survive within people's conscience.'' He spoke of the 17 years he lived in forced obscurity after being removed from office in 1969 and stripped of party membership in 1970. `` They wanted to totally isolate me. I was followed everywhere,'' he said. `` I had to keep my circle of friends small to protect them. Maybe they thought I could n't take it psychologically but I could. It's been a hard life but we are still here.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was relegated to work as a minor forestry official in the Slovak capital of <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> and barred from travel. The restrictions were relaxed after Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in April 1987. Reforms instituted by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have surged like a tidal wave through the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and on Nov. 24 <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> government resigned under public pressure. Tens of thousands of people cheered <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s Wenceslas Square on his triumphant return to the capital. `` To speak in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> gave me a deep sense of satisfaction,'' he said Monday. `` Twenty years ago their parents cheered me. Now these children are doing the same and supporting the same ideas.'' He said many of the democratic reforms being demanded now were part of his 1968 plans. `` There was no internal power willing to stop the ` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring,' we were suppressed by external force,'' he said, speaking through an interpreter. `` The basic idea is the same now. You can not suppress an idea. An idea is going to survive within people's conscience.'' Thousands of Czechoslovaks demonstrated Monday, protesting the composition of the new Communist-dominated government. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was asked if he might become president and he said, `` For the presidency it's up to the people to decide.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> received virtually complete vindication Monday when a <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> condemned the 1968 invasion as `` interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign'' <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday it's too early to proclaim an end to the Cold War, but added that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s acceptance of sweeping reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` absolutely mandates new thinking'' by the West. Wrapping up his weekend summit journey with a stop at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told reporters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would maintain `` significant military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as long as our allies desire our presence.'' The president said he wants a treaty making initial cuts in superpowers conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` in the bank'' before seeking deeper reductions. He told <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders he hoped a multinational summit could be convened in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> next summer to sign such an accord. Conventional forces aside, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are negotiating a proposed 50 percent cut in long-range nuclear weapons, as well as a proposed ban of chemical weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in a buoyant mood as he neared the end of a journey that took him to last weekend's summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Asked if it had n't been risky to venture out in a small boat in the storm-tossed harbor in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> during the weekend, he replied, `` Hot dogging? ... No. You know these charismatic, macho, visionary guys. They'll do anything.'' He arrived at the White House in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by helicopter from <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base to be greeted on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> by his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, who got a kiss, and dog <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, who got a pat. The president waved to a small welcoming crowd and headed inside without speaking. The president spoke as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was convening a meeting of a radically reordered <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to review the weekend summit. The dramatic change in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> continued uninterrupted during the day, as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the four other <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> nations condemned their own invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, about 200,000 demonstrators broke into wild rounds of applause as speakers called for German reunification. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> leaders agreed at an unprecedented joint news conference before leaving <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> that their meeting heralded a new era of cooperation in East-West relations, including arms control and trade. They intend to meet again in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the second half of June. At his news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We stand at the threshold of a new era ...'' but declined to assert the Cold War has ended as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested. `` That day has n't arrived,'' the president said when asked about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statement declaring an end to the `` epoch of the Cold War.'' Barring a utopian development, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must stay involved'' by keeping troops massed against <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> forces. `` If you want to project out 100 years, or take some years off of that, you can look to a utopian day when there might be none -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' he said. `` But as I pointed out to them -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders -RRB-, that day has n't arrived _ and they agree with me.'' Dutch Prime Minister <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> said he was impressed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' `` extraordinarily positive attitude'' toward events in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` It has nothing to do with a ` we are pulling out' attitude,'' he told reporters. `` On the contrary, they are again promising a meaningful presence -LRB- in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech `` was so full of meat that we really should consider it very carefully before we reply to it.'' She has urged a more cautious attitude than some allies toward events unfolding in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The president began his news conference with a statement that said a `` peaceful revolution'' was taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where five hardline communist regimes have fallen in recent weeks. He said his goal was to see `` individual freedom everywhere replace coercion and tyranny.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, apparently referring to disagreements about <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said `` all was not sweetness and light'' at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit, but took pains to applaud <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s handling of the change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` As I watched the way in which Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has handled the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it deserves new thinking. It absolutely mandates new thinking,'' he said. Asked what had emerged at the summit, he said `` I think he took my measure and I took his and I think we both feel more comfortable about our common objectives.'' He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was `` determined and unemotional `` in their private talks. The Soviet leader `` seemed very much in control'' and `` very confident in discussing without notes a wide array of subjects with me.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said some allied nations seek deeper cuts in conventional forces than are being considered in the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks. But he said they viewed `` the rapidity of change differently than we do.'' And yet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> registered a renewed personal determination to realize completion of the treaty next year between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact that would cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops by 30,000 and the Soviets by 325,000, to an equal level of 275,000. The two alliances' armories of tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear weapons also are due to be cut back in a grand scheme to reduce tensions from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> across the vast expanse of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Let's get it done,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He told reporters, `` I, as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, will kick the bureaucracy to get it done.'' Negotiators working on the accord in the Austrian capital are making brisk progress but several issues are unresolved, most significantly a dispute over the kind of Soviet airplanes to be scrapped. In addition, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was hopeful the West could take steps to ease Soviet economic woes. `` We want to try to meet him on some of the areas where he needs help. I'm thinking of a few suggestions I had in the economic area,'' he said. `` But I also believe that the West must remain strong and together and try to be helpful where we can in a united way, but not be imprudent,'' he said. Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reported to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had accepted the multi-nation summit proposal for next year. `` The importance of this is that it indicates both -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- want to make an effort to reach such an agreement next year,'' the Dutch official told reporters. Also at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> session <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined his policy on German reunification. It rejected a timetable, even though <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> on Sunday had predicted a merger of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> within five years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he favored a step by step approach that also maintained West German membership in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and said, `` I am not trying to accelerate that process.'' Even so, officials announced that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was sending Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> next week for a symbolic visit to the Berlin Wall, a symbol of the Cold War that has been opened to free travel.

<HEAD>PLO Efforts to Upgrade its U.N. Status Collapse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign to win recognition in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> as the provisional government of Palestine broke down Monday and negotiations shifted to finding a face-saving retreat, diplomats said. They attributed the failure to upgrade the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to observer-nation status in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to shallow support, divisions within the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> threat to stop contributing to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. A vote on the resolution was postponed until Wednesday. `` The climate is not right now,'' said a senior <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> diplomat, speaking privately. He said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> might try to revive the idea next year. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> as an observer organization. It was seeking to gain recognition as a non-voting observer state, such as <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said it would cut off all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s status was upgraded. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is assessed $ 216 million annually, one-fourth of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget. One Western diplomat, speaking on the condition he not be identified, said a rift had developed between <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, at the organization's headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaddoumi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> foreign </ORGANIZATION> secretary who heads the group's <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> delegation. <PERSON> Khaddoumi </PERSON> was `` the guiding force'' behind the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> resolution to upgrade the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s status, while <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> believed the effort was counterproductive and last week ordered a halt, the diplomat said. European and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats worked with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and non-aligned movement officials through the weekend to avoid a showdown. Negotiations on a discrete way for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> group to postpone consideration of the resolution were not complete when the time arrived Monday afternoon for a vote and formal action was deferred until Wednesday. The diplomatic sources said the resolution will be suspended Wednesday. As a member of the 102-member non-aligned movement, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supposedly had enough support to prevail on a simple majority vote in the 159-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. But Western diplomats said the vote could have been very close because many non-aligned Nations did not feel the issue was worth losing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> in the Arab group did not support the resolution and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies also were opposed. The resolution draft states the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` has the powers and responsibilities of the Provisional Government of the State of Palestine'' and `` shall be construed, within the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, as the State of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>.'' Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declared the existence of a state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> without specifying exact borders in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and has said more than 80 nations formally recognized the state. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and many Western governments have not recognized the move, saying the declared state lacks the basic attributes of a state, such as a functioning government and defensible boundaries.

 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders met Monday amid rapid, bewildering political change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and uncertainty about the 34-year-old military alliance's role and unity. At Monday's session, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and Pact members <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> condemned their own action in invading <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968 to crush a reform movement. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> will begin talks on possible reduction of Soviet troops still based in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> indicated at the meeting that the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and its Western opponent, the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, will someday become political rather than military alliances. For leaders of four of the seven nations, it was their first meeting, underscoring how quickly old guard Communists have been swept from power. They heard <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> report on his <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Erstwhile diplomatic cover for the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s ideological policing of its allies, the seven-member pact faces unprecedented pluralism, from its first non-Communist head of government, Polish Premier <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s hard-line Communist leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. Somehow, those men must agree on <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s future and defense policy if the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact is to be an alliance in anything but name. Chastened by past interventions in their countries' lives, some reformers now in power also want guarantees that the pact's armed might will not be turned on them Having already ceased to make ideological demands on its allies, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact should `` stay out'' of member nations' politics altogether, said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where legal groundwork was laid this fall for democratic, multiparty elections. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>'s fears are not baseless: In mid-August, the Romanians reportedly requested joint <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact action against <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to preserve <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rule. In fact, under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Soviets appear ready to accept virtually any sort of political change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, provided allegiance is unshaken to the defense treaty written in 1955 at a time of tight, sometimes violent Kremlin domination. `` All the reforms which no one could have imagined a few years ago will be accepted in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, unless they lead to the questioning of membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>,'' the Polish newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Zycie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warszawy </ORGANIZATION> commented recently. Intriguingly, recent Soviet pronouncements indicate the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> envisons the pact's future in a blurring of functions with the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION>, the notoriously ineffective socialist trade bloc that includes all <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact members. In October, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would be interested in negotiating the abolition of both <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact by the year 2000, as part of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> campaign to create a `` common European home.'' But later, in an interview with the official Polish news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> noted: `` For the time being, the two alliances do exist and one should aim for their gradually being transformed into political-military organizations through developing civilian trends of their activity with a simultaneous reduction of all military elements.'' What East bloc military leaders, traditionally subservient to their parties, think of such notions is unknown, but <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers sounded an apparent note of discord at a meeting in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on Nov. 27-29 by highlighting the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> `` threat.'' `` The military budgets and long-term development programs of the armed forces of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries still aim to preserve military might as the chief tool of attaining their foreign policy objectives,'' the ministers said in a communique. According to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> figures, the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has 3 million full-time military personnel, compared with 2.2 million for the Western alliance. Pact statistics in contrast claim rough parity: 3.6 million for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and 3.5 million for the East bloc. The `` Agreement on Friendship, Coordination and Mutual Assistance'' was signed May 14, 1955, in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. The treaty was in effect a response to the admission of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> 10 days earlier. The pact provided the machinery by which the Soviets could control the Eastern European military, transmit foreign policy guidelines to their satellites and exercise political control throughout the `` cordon sanitaire'' to their west. The treaty was used as a legal screen for military interventions now condemned by <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s reform governments. In 1956, revolt broke out in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> when the government demanded the withdrawal of Soviet troops and stated its intention to leave the pact to become a neutral country. Soviets troops crushed the revolt and installed a new leadership. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s `` Prague Spring'' reforms in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> also were snuffed out when Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks invaded in 1968 to restore a Moscow-aligned government. Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> said the alliance had the `` sacred duty'' to protect socialism wherever it was threatened. That assertion, which became known as the <ORGANIZATION> Brezhnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION>, has been repudiated by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> jocularly noted the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> now practices `` the <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> <PERSON> Doctrine </PERSON>,'' named for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s trademark song `` My Way,'' by letting each of its allies do things `` its way.'' Some disagreement with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was allowed in the past. The Communist hermit state of <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> formally pulled out of the pact to protest the invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In 1958, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> withdrew from its agreement to permit stationing of Soviet troops on its soil, and ceased to take part in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military exercises. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s allies also balked when the Soviets, in 1956-7 and 1967-8, tried to form a standing <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact army. They feared their troops might be deployed to support purely Soviet adventures, for example on the Chinese border. Nevertheless, 34 years after its creation, the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s machinery remains dominated at all levels by Soviets In February, Gen. <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Lushev </PERSON>, a first deputy defense minister, replaced another Soviet, Marshal <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulikov </PERSON>, as alliance commander.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> disclosed Monday that he had ordered a preliminary inquiry to determine whether a special prosecutor should investigate alleged criminal wrongdoing by former <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> delivered earlier in the day informed lawmakers of the action <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> ordered the inquiry in response to a request by 19 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats that he appoint a special prosecutor, formally known as an independent counsel, to investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> when he ran the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the preliminary inquiry, which the department has 60 days to complete, started on Saturday. A lawyer for <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, dismissed the move as insignificant, saying he was confident it would not result in appointment of an independent counsel. `` Under the very low threshhold the statute requires, we are n't surprised that a preliminary inquiry has been undertaken,'' <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said `` We are confident that at the end of the 90-day period they will find there is no basis for appointing an independent counsel.'' Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., one of two members who led the call for an independent counsel, said he was `` pleased that we are finally moving in the right direction of exploring the criminal side of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandal. `` I hope that if a special prosecutor is ultimately ordered that the attorney general will ask for broad jurisdiction so that the prosecution, if any, at the highest levels of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> are all coordinated,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. `` There is enough here that justifies a careful look by an independent counsel.'' Lawmakers suggested there was evidence of a conspiracy by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and other top officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> to defraud federal urban aid programs by awarding grants on the basis of political favoritism. The congressmen, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had also suggested in their Nov. 2 letter that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had lied to the House Government Operations employment and housing subcommittee when he testified last spring. The lawmakers cited <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s testimony that he was did not have a `` hands on'' involvement in dispensing <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants to private developers. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who with <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> led the call for an independent counsel, said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s decision `` is a move that should be welcomed by everyone, including ex-Secretary <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>.. `` This investigation is a fair and thorough way to get answers to questions that are not going away,'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said He said he was convinced that an independent counsel `` is the best and perhaps only way that all answers about the scandal will come out.'' Under the independent counsel law, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was required to decide within 15 days of receiving the lawmakers' Nov. 2 letter whether to proceed with a preliminary inquiry. The law gave him another 15 days to report that decision to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Independent counsels are appointed by a special federal court that reviews applications submitted by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. After receiving their request last month, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> pointedly accused of of the lawmakers of trying to inject `` partisan politics into this matter, which has until now been handled on a non-partisan, professinal way by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and this department.'' `` Even more distressing is the assertion by the congressmen that criminal acts have been committed before criminal investigations have been completed,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s comments were directed at Schumer and <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. In a session with reporters last week, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> bristled at the suggestion that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was not aggressively pursuing an investigation of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> because the two men sat together in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet. `` Let me tell this, in this or any other case, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is going to go where the evidence leads,'' the attorney general said. `` If the evidence is there, we will take appropropriate action; if it's not, we wo n't.'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> would not have ordered with preliminary inquiry without the request from the lawmakers, saying, `` There is no indication that it would n't have happened without our initiative.''

 <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> hero who switched sides and fought with the Contras, said Monday that opposition groups in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> did not want him to return from exile. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>, also know as Commander Zero, is a former <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> vice minister of defense who fought with the Contras from 1983-86 and then retired to private life. He returned Sunday to support the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Repeating what he said at a rally immediately after his arrival, <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> called the Social Christians an alternative to the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>, in the Feb. 25 national elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its presidential candidate <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> persuaded <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and support them. Few believe <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> can add many more followers to the Social Christians. The controversy surrounding Commander Zero already has attracted the kind of news media attention the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION>, a minority party, had sought unsuccessfully. About 25 journalists crowded a small conference room Monday morning at party headquarters, but ignored <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, who sat next to <LOCATION> Pastora </LOCATION>. Many questions revolved around <LOCATION> Pastora </LOCATION>'s past. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> said that he had spoken with some <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> members. `` They left me with the impression that they did not want me to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' `` Sectors of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in alliance with the Contras'' were responsible for the bombing at his southern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> jungle hideout in 1984, where four journalists were killed, he said. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> alleged that the attempt was made `` because I never wanted to accept anti-popular postures'' adopted by the Contras. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> said he intends to settle in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if he can continue the fishing business he runs in neighboring <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Commander Zero, as he is still known, gained world attention Aug. 20, 1978, when he led 20 <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> rebels in a takeover of the National Palace. The rebels held dozens of legislators hostage and succeeded in freeing from prison 50 <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> leaders, among them <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON>, who are now president and interior minister. Eleven months later, the Sandinista came to power in a popular revolt that forced President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> to flee. After the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> victory in 1979, <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> became vice minister of defense and of interior but grew disillusioned with the Sandinistas and left the country in 1981. It is said he was embittered when he was denied the post of defense minister, which went to and is still held by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON>. In 1983 <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> joined the Contras, fighting in the southern front, but his outspoken criticism and independence soon led him into strong differences with the Contras. In 1986 he quit fighting and left for <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> emerged from a weekend meeting with no clearcut policy on abortion, an issue many <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members believe cost them the election for governor.

He said debating the resolution would provide `` a catalyst for the press,'' which he said has tried to portray the party as divided on the abortion issue. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> said the party's inaction at its three-day meeting in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> leaves the impression that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> remains captive to abortion opponents. He said he'd resubmit his resolution when the committee meets in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> Feb. 24.

 State Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> went on trial Monday on federal corruption charges that could result in a 220-year prison sentence and more than $ 3 million in fines. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, refused to answer reporters' questions as he entered the courthouse accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Pilar </PERSON>, and two of his daughters. As <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> questioned potential jurors, <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> sat between his two lawyers at the defense table and occasionally made notes on a pad. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, 50, a Democrat from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION>, has pleaded innocent to a dozen felony counts that accuse him of bribery, extortion, racketeering and money laundering. He faces a maximum penalty of more than $ 3 million in fines and 220 years in prison if convicted on all counts. He is the first person to be tried as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s 4-year-old investigation of alleged corruption at the state Capitol He is accused of obtaining or attempting to obtain money in exchange for votes. Among other things, the charges include allegations that <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> accepted a $ 3,000 `` honorarium'' from an undercover agent in exchange for help in getting a special-interest bill through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe came to light after about 30 federal agents raided the Capitol on the night of Aug. 24-25, 1988 and searched the offices of <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, three other lawmakers and their aides. In their investigation, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents set up dummy companies and claimed they were seeking legislation to help them set up a shrimp importing operation in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Charges also have been filed against an Assembly aide, a former <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> aide, a former <LOCATION> Yolo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff and a former undersheriff. The aide and the former undersheriff have agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, who is heading a three-member team that is prosecuting the case, filed a list of 63 potential prosecution witnesses, including <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Players </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>; actor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>; and several Capitol lobbyists.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> Monday night to express concern for the lives of Americans in hotels occupied by rebel soldiers and to pay tribute to her courage in seeking to quell the rebellion, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had just completed a 9-hour journey from <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, where he briefed the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies on his weekend summit with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, when he called the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> leader. `` The president tried to call Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> earlier in the day and was unable to get through. So when we got home tonight ... he went immediately up to the residence and re-placed the call,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The rebellion broke out Friday before dawn Philippine time, just before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> embarked on his journey to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> presided over an all-night meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later approved overflights by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter jets based in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to keep rebel aircraft on the ground. Despite claims by the Aquino government that it had quashed the rebellion, fighting continued in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> for a fifth day Tuesday, with 2,000 foreign tourists and business people trapped in the embattled <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> financial district. Some 215 Americans were holed up at three hotels in the district, according to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy. The Aquino government said Tuesday it had arranged bus transportation to evacuate the foreigners to the airport, and a rebel spokesman telephoned news agencies to say the foreigners would be released. At least 70 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded since mutineers seized several military installations and bombed the presidential palace Friday. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as telling Aquino: `` ` I understand some Americans are in the hotels. ... Can we get those people out? I'm very concerned about their lives and their safety.' `` She assured him they were doing everything possible to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Then the president ended the conversation by saying, ` I appreciate your concern for the civilians. We're proud of you for standing up with great courage. We want to see you succeed.''' Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was considering sending in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to rescue the Americans, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We do n't think that will be necessary.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> because `` he just wanted to register his concern for the lives of Americans who were trapped in these hotels. ... He just wanted to ask that she make every attempt to protect their lives.'' National security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, who had accompanied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Air Force One on the journey back from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, was with the president as he made the call from his personal quarters.

The letter and petition are being sent to every <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> household in the state, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who has held the seat 18 years, said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s entry into the race will make it more interesting. `` Oh, it ups the ante. There will be some national attention here, and it will make it more fun also,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said during a visit to <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> on Monday. The election will be Oct. 6, 1990. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said he thought his past as imperial wizard of the Knights of the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> would help his candidacy. `` I think it says to a lot of people that I will stand up for my principals and ideals. ... I wo n't compromise my ideals,'' he said. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said he has raised $ 60,000 in cash and $ 224,000 in pledges for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign. He said his platform would be the same as it was in his campaign for the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, when he called for eliminating affirmative action and busing to achieve school desegregation, among other things. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said his official announcement probably would be made in January.

<TEXT>
 The main defendant in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest political trial in decades accused <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s leadership Monday of staging the trial as part of its policy of repressing ethnic Albanians <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, told the court on the first day of his defense that `` the trial represents the worst possible violation of ... human rights.'' <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> and 14 other ethnic Albanians are accused of engaging in counterrevolutionary activities and of inciting unrest last winter in which at least 25 people died. At the time, ethnic Albanians, who make up almost 90 percent of the province's 1.9 million people, were angered by constitutional amendments that gave <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> greater control over the affairs of the province. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is a part of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the nation's largest republic, and had previously enjoyed a measure of autonomy. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> denied the charge that he was responsible for the deaths, which occurred during clashes between protesters and security forces. He said his trial was organized by <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, the republic's leader, and <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morina </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s current party chief. District public prosecutor <PERSON> Spasoje </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamfirovic </PERSON> demanded several times that <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> be prevented from giving what he said was a political speech, but judge <PERSON> Ismet </PERSON> <PERSON> Emra </PERSON> overruled the objections. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> denied he had visited a nearby mine, where workers staged an eight-day sit-in in February to `` incite the strikers,'' as claimed in the indictment. `` I went there exclusively for humane reasons,'' he said, adding that he had reported his activities to <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> and to <PERSON> Morina </PERSON>. `` A political trial has been staged on behalf of a policy which advocated repression in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> so that -LRB- the province -RRB- may be ruled through a state of emergency instead of democratic methods,'' <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> led the drive earlier this year for constitutional amendments he said were necessary to protect <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Slav minority from harassment by ethnic Albanians. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, 42, faces the death sentence if found guilty. He is being held in the <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION> prison during the trial, which began Oct. 30. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> said prison conditions were `` brutal'' but that he would not be broken. `` I can disappear physically but I will not submit,'' he said. The trial continues Tuesday and <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>'s defense presentation is expected to last five days. The federal leadership meanwhile said Monday that a clash between <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, two of its constituent republics, seriously threatens <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> unity. The statement from the nation's eight-member state presidency was carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> cut all political and business contacts with <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> last Wednesday after authorities there banned a rally by Serbs. The presidency said without elaborating it will take all steps necessary to solve the worst political crisis in <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s 46 years of existence. It said the federation's political situation `` has dangerously deteriorated'' because of the clash, `` which seriously threatens <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s integrity.'' The Yugoslav federation consists of six republics and two autonomous provinces, encompassing varied ethnic groups and religions. The latest row brought to a head a long series of bitter disputes between <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s liberal-oriented leadership advocates regional autonomy and has legalized opposition parties that are to contest the first-ever free multiparty elections in post-World War II <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, scheduled for next March. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s leadership favors a centralized federation and opposes Western-style political pluralism. Several Serbian firms said Monday they are severing all economic ties with Slovenian firms and closing down branch offices there. Economists say cutting business ties will backfire, since <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> is economically much weaker than <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s political, economic and social problems have mushroomed since the death in 1980 of President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, who founded the modern Yugoslav federation in 1943.

<TEXT>
 The armed forces eased a dusk-to-dawn curfew Monday, claiming it had 90 percent of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> under control after a three-week rebel offensive. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, hit hard for the first time in the 10-year-old civil war, began enjoying a sustained calm over the weekend. The armed forces press office said the curfew now will be from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. instead of 6 p.m to 6 a.m. Although an armed forces spokesman said reports of only `` small, routine'' combat emerged Monday, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> news crew said they saw heavy fighting 25 miles south of the capital in <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> source said the guerrillas used two more recently acquired anti-aircraft missiles. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said both missed their targets, O-2 observation planes. The guerrillas used the weapon for the first time last week, firing two missiles at A-37 jet fighters but missing their mark. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> suspended relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Nov. 26, saying planes from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> flew in the missiles. Meanwhile, the arraignment of a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> woman accused of hiding rebel arms was postponed. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, the judge of the military tribunal where <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> was to appear, said he expected strict new anti-terrorist measures would be applied retroactively, affecting her case. The measures have not yet been signed into law by rightist President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, 28, a native of <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and a former resident of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, worked for an ecumenical group that acted as liaison for visiting church groups and congressional aides. Authorities say they unearthed a huge munitions cache in her yard Nov. 26, including more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition for AK-47 assault rifles. Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, here to advise Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, said she does not want to leave, even it if means spending time in prison. He said she will plead innocent when charges are filed. The judge said her arraignment was postponed because of confusion about jurisdiction and procedure. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lay missionary from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was freed Monday after spending the weekend in a 10-by-16 foot cell with 15 other people. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a slender, soft-spoken <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> native, was picked up Thursday night in a parish house in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> slum along with a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> priest and three Salvadoran lay workers. He said he spent most of the first night and part of the first day blindfolded and handcuffed, standing against a wall. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who has spent three years working among the poor and those displaced by the war, said police administered a paraffin test to see if he had fired a gun and accused him of being involved with the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. He was freed on the condition he leave <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>; no charges were filed. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he leaves reluctantly. `` Through the years, I've come to know the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people, particularly the poor, and the Salvadoran Church quite well,'' he said. `` I know what they are living through, what they are suffering.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> launched an urban offensive Nov. 11 that paralyzed the capital for more than a week and led to imposition of the curfew. The <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government also imposed a state of siege that suspends many constitutional guarantees, including freedom of the press and the right of assembly. In another development, a summit of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and four other Central American presidents was scheduled for Dec. 10-12 in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, sources close to President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> said Monday. The meeting is to deal with relocation of Nicaraguan rebels from camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.

 A fugitive East German trade official wanted in his country for suspected illegal currency and weapons deals might be in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, government spokesman <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said Monday. But he said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has not sent a request for the apprehension of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> and even if it did it was uncertain if he could be sent back. The East German government said Sunday that <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON>, a state secretary in the foreign trade ministry, fled the country after an investigation was ordered into a secret operation to ship weapons to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It said a warrant was issued Sunday for his arrest and the government was enlisting its embassies in an international search for him. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> and other East German finance officials were in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> last Wednesday holding talks with West German authorities. `` We do n't know where he is now,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was asked if <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> might still be in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and he said, `` That's something we ca n't exclude. But we are not looking for him.'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said there were no indications <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> has committed any illegal acts in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> noted there is no extradition treaty between the two Germanys and said he did not know what could be done if <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> asked that the suspect be seized and returned. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s most prominent lawyer, said <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> had asked that he represent him.

 Retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdon </PERSON>, who commanded one of the ships that helped integrate blacks into the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s regular ranks, has died of prostate cancer at age 76. <PERSON> Purdon </PERSON> died at his home near <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> on Saturday. Blacks were usually restricted to being mess attendants before the experiments in desegregation during World War II on ships such as <PERSON> Purdon </PERSON>'s submarine chaser, the PC1264, said <PERSON> Purdon </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The PC1264 was commissioned to demonstrate whether blacks could be capable seamen. One of the crewmen on the ship was <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravely </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who became the first American black admiral. After World War II, <PERSON> Purdon </PERSON> was an intelligence analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the forerunner of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, until 1948, when he was recalled to active duty in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. After retiring in 1963, he was a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> and a special aide to the director of the Job Corps. His book, `` Black Company, The Story of Subchaser 1264,'' detailing the mission, was published in 1972. He was born in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and educated in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 An environmental coalition plans an international tribunal on the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chemical leak in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, that killed more than 3,500 people, the organizers said Monday. The tribunal, which will have no binding powers, will be held next fall by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, a group of concerned citizens and environmentalists in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON>. Sunday was the fifth anniversary of the world's worst industrial accident, in which thousands of people were killed when methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a Union Carbide pesticide plant in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, a central Indian city about 360 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. At least 3,598 people have died from effects of the gas, and relief workers say victims continue to die at a rate of at least one a day. Most of the 20,000 survivors suffer from eye and lung ailments and are unable to work. Ms. <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON> said the major purpose of the tribunal will be to devise an international framework to protect victims of such catastrophes. `` We want to present an outline of international legislation on fixing liability in such disasters,'' she said. Union Carbide gave $ 470 million to the Indian government in April in final compensation for the accident, which it claimed was the result of sabotage by a disgruntled employee. `` It's a ridiculous amount,'' Ms. <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON> said at a presentation of the environmental coalition's plans for the tribunal. The Indian government originally had sued the U.S.-based multinational company for $ 3 billion, alleging negligence. The tribunal is to convene in October and take testimony from victims in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>. The proceedings are to end in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in December, Ms. <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON> said. She said the composition of the tribunal had not been decided.

 Romanian gymnast <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, who fled her Communist homeland for freedom in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, arrived here Monday night and said she would be settling in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, 28, escaped from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Tuesday, reportedly enduring a muddy, 6-hour nighttime trek through rough terrain before reaching the Hungarian border. `` I came here a few years ago and I liked it,'' <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> after arriving on Pan Am Flight 2077 on the arm of <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Panit </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hallandale </LOCATION>, a fellow Romanian exile who helped her defect.

<TEXT>
 There is n't a messier musical in town than `` Up Against It,'' an apt title for this chaotic song and dance adaptation of an unproduced screenplay originally written by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Orton </PERSON> for the Beatles. The musical, which opened Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, defeats a lot of people _ particularly a slew of talented performers such as <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Casnoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Dibuono </PERSON>, director <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Orton </PERSON> himself. Only hints of <PERSON> Orton </PERSON>'s wicked humor show through in this flat-footed and tuneless version of his story adapted for the stage by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> with music and lyrics by rock star <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundgren </PERSON>. <PERSON> Orton </PERSON>, the iconoclastic English playwright who was murdered by his lover in 1967, apparently fashioned a satiric tale about the adventures of two British scamps and a subsequent war between the sexes. In the musical, the battle takes place after a group of radical men have assassinated the female prime minister. She is replaced by another, even tougher woman, played with relentless assurance by the booming <PERSON> Dibuono </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' scattershot book takes on religion, the rich, right-wing politicians, sexual stereotyping, the military and all points in between. The low point of the musical occurs when the men dress up as women to infiltrate a political rally held by the prime minister. The number is called _ what else _ `` Life Is a Drag'' and it is as hard to watch as it is to listen to. Most of <PERSON> Rundgren </PERSON>'s score is a disappointment. Except for a fine ballad entitled `` Parallel Lines,'' it is remarkably conventional, blandly at odds with the outrageousness of the story being told on stage. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> has directed the show at a furious pace, and <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>'s choreography is equally athletic. Nothing stops for very long, although the musical numbers have a way of numbing the story line rather than advancing the plot. What <PERSON> Orton </PERSON> and the Beatles would have done with `` Up Against It'' is a tantalizing question. There are hints of such Beatle movies as `` A Hard Day's Night'' and `` Help!'' in some of the musical's more frantic posturings. But you would be better off to rent videos of those classics than sit through `` Up Against It.''

 Rancher <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Raba </PERSON> figures the present calendar switches around too much on the number of days in a month, so he's drawn up a new plan where there'd be 28 days each month _ all 13 of them. `` I have n't had hardly anybody that did n't agree with me'' said <ORGANIZATION> Raba </ORGANIZATION>, 78. `` But I might not live long enough to see the change.'' His calendar would be easy to understand and remember, <ORGANIZATION> Raba </ORGANIZATION> says. Thirteen 28-day months equals 364 days. Making up for the 365th day is simple. Just create a 48-hour New Year's Day. Leap Year every four years also would have an extra 48-hour day, wiping out the current Feb. 29. The current calendar, adopted in 1582, has 12 months with either 28, 29, 30 or 31 days. The Raba calendar would mean fixed-date holidays would always be on the same day of the week. Every month would start on Monday, which is the first day of <ORGANIZATION> Raba </ORGANIZATION>'s weeks. The current names of months and days would remain, but the 13th month would need a name. <ORGANIZATION> Raba </ORGANIZATION> said he has suggested the calendar to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, former Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Janklow </PERSON>, current Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, Canadian officials and others. `` All the answers I got, they thought it made sense and was good,'' he said. `` But most did n't know if we was quite ready for it yet. ... They all agreed that we're due for a change somehow.''

 A bank robbery suspect holed up inside a house Monday wounded a policeman, then threatened suicide an automatic pointed at his chest before a sharpshooter shot it out of his hand, ending a nearly three-hour standoff, police said. A man and a woman also were arrested in the holdup, spokesman <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> said. The gunman kept police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents at bay with random shots fired from inside the house with a .45 - caliber automatic, <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> The man emerged from the house in this eastern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> city around 2:30 p.m. after police filled it with tear gas, <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> said. He then lay down on the porch, pointed his pistol at his chest and flashed a `` peace'' sign. A SWAT team member shot the gun out of the man's hand, and officers captured him, <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> said. The man was not seriously wounded. Shots fired from inside the house hit Officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Giammarino </PERSON> three times in the arm and once in the chest. He was in stable condition at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> said. `` His bulletproof vest probably saved his life,'' the spokesman said. The incident began around 9:50 a.m., when the gunman and the other two suspects were seen fleeing the robbery of a <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branch. An unidentified motorist followed their car, saw them switch vehicles, followed them to the house and called authorities, <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> said. The woman and the other man emerged from the house a short time later and surrendered, <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> said. All three suspects were being held at the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> police department. Their identities were withheld pending formal charges, <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> said. Authorities recovered an unspecified amount of money from the holdup.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> outmuscled <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> anti-nuclear protesters Monday, crippling their vessels and towing them out of an area where they tried unsuccessfully to halt the test launch of a Trident 2 missile. The high seas drama took place in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> 50 miles off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast just before the nuclear-powered submarine <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> unleashed the $ 26.5 million missile on a test that put the Trident 2 program back on track after two explosive failures in the first three undersea launches. `` We did a perfect launch, just beuatiful,'' Vice Adm. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Submarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said its ships had to `` shoulder'' aside a large ship carrying protesters, and capture and tow away two high-speed rafts called Zodiacs from the launch area. <LOCATION> Greenpeace </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> peace activists said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rammed their ship, aimed fire hoses down its smoke stacks to stop its engines and that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers had sliced the fuel lines and punctured the pontoons on the Zodiacs. <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> said hoses were used and that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sailors in rafts cut the fuel lines on one of the Zodiacs after the other broke down in heavy seas. Three <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopters made life even more miserable for the two men in each of the Zodiacs by hovering overhead, making already choppy seas even choppier. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the protesters, said a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship, the 254-foot submarine support ship USS Grasp, left two gashes in the hull of the <ORGANIZATION> MV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, a 190-foot ocean-going tug. She said the largest, about 3 feet long, was stuffed with mattresses to keep water out. Cmdr. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials at the scene reported only one hole about 1 foot in diameter in the Greenpeace hull. `` This is a terrible outrage,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahouth </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement. `` This is an unbridled act of aggression against a peaceful protest in international waters.'' <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> was considering legal action against the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> had successfully used the ship and Zodiacs to block a Trident 2 launch attempt July 28. But the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was ready for them this time. `` We were more prepared today because we looked at what they tried to do on July 28, and we used the minimum force necessary today to clear the area,'' <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> said. Once the protesters' vessels were muscled outside the 5,000-yard diameter safety circle, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> sent the 44-foot missile shooting out of a tube in the deck. It broke the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> surface, ignited and propelled a dummy warhead package to an ocean target several thousand miles away. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> announced the success about 20 minutes after the 10:40 a.m. launch. `` We issued repeated warnings to clear the area,'' <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON> said of the Greenpeace incident. `` The MV <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged our warnings and declared its intention to stay in the area. Two submarine support ships, Grasp and <PERSON> Kittiwake </PERSON>, shouldered it out of the safety arc.'' <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON> said the warning told the protesters that if the ship did not move, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> `` will exercise its rights under international law and will forcibly remove you.'' The MV <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> radioed back, `` You are doing your best but you have n't sunk us yet; we are staying.'' <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said the ship was `` dead in the water'' for a while after the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships poured water down the smoke stacks, but the crew got one of the two engines restarted and the ship headed for port in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, after non-essential people were taken off by helicopter. The incident began shortly after the nuclear submarine USS Tennessee submerged for the attempt to launch the Trident 2 missile on its fourth test flight. Two of the first three Trident 2 launches from the submarine ended in explosions just above the surface. The second in the series was declared a success by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The failures, blamed on an inadequately designed nozzle system, had set back the plan to send operational Trident 2s to sea late this year. But if the program continues to succeed over about half a dozen more undersea launches, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is scheduled to go on operational patrol next spring with 24 of the deadly missiles. Each is capable of hurling up to 12 nuclear warheads to different targets more than 4,600 miles away. Nineteen land-launch tests, 15 of them successful, preceded the sea trials.

<HEAD>Church Leaders Call for Non-Judgmental Care of AIDS Sufferers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN S. CARLSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Church leaders Monday called on religious individuals and organizations to provide non-judgmental and compassionate care and support to people suffering from AIDS. The leaders also called on churches to develop accurate and comprehensive AIDS education materials `` in a context that promotes individual self-esteem, teaches the fundamental goodness of human sexuality and supports the integrity of responsible and caring intimate relationships.'' The comments were included in a consensus statement on appropriate religious responses to the AIDS epidemic adopted Monday by about 130 clergy and lay leaders from Christian, Jewish, Unitarian and interfaith groups during a conference at the Carter Presidential Center. The religious community has a responsibility `` to assure that all whose lives are affected by the epidemic will have access to compassion, non-judgmental care, respect, support and assistance,'' the statement said. The Right Rev. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Theuner </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS and bishop of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, said church leaders must overcome a perception among AIDS sufferers that religious people view the disease as the `` wraith of God'' for an immoral lifestyle. `` Some think that the religious community believes AIDS is a judgment of God. But by and large the religious community does not and those of us in a position of leadership need to convey that more forcefully,'' he said. The consensus statement said churches have a responsibility to `` transform public attitudes and policies so that adequate care and appropriate preventative measures will be available for all people in need.'' The group called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` to demonstrate moral and political leadership'' by protecting people with AIDS from discrimination, by expanding drug-treatment programs to all who choose them, by expediting the experimental treatment approval process, by expanding home-care programs for AIDS sufferers and by encouraging strict confidentiality of AIDS tests. The statement said foreigners should be allowed to visit or become citizens of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if they are eligible to do so, regardless of whether they have AIDS. The group also advocated comprehensive programs for drug users `` including the distribution of AIDS prevention information and materials including bleach for the sterilization of hypodermic needles.'' AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ is a deadly disease which attacks the body's immune system, crippling its ability to ward off infections that are not a problem for most people, such as a rare pneumonia and a rare skin cancer. The latest federal public health figures indicate 112,241 people have been reported with AIDS since 1981 and 59 percent of them have die from it. No one is known to have recovered. Sixty percent of the total cases have involved homosexual or bisexual males, 20 percent were intravenous drug abusers and another 7 percent were both drug abusers who were also homosexual males. Forty-three percent of all cases involved minorities. In a reference to those statistics, the group said in its consensus statement that, `` Because barriers among us based on religion, race, class, gender and sexual orientation that continue to generate fear, persecution and violence are intensified by the -LRB- AIDS epidemic -RRB-, we call upon all sectors of our society, particularly our faith communities, to adopt as highest priority the elimination of racism, classism, sexism and homophobia.'' The conference was cosponsored by the AIDS <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and The Carter Center of <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Among the groups represented were the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the African <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synagogue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregations </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Unitarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the Baptist General Convention of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> called for curbs Monday on the pesticide EBDC, saying widespread use of the chemical on scores of crops from apples to tomatoes poses an unreasonable cancer risk. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> proposed eliminating the use of the EBDC family of fungicides on 45 crops, but said its continued use on another 10 food products, including grapes, onions and cranberries, `` do not present an unreasonable risk'' to consumers.

EBDCs, or ethylene bisdithiocarbamate, are a group of pesticides that have been used since the 1930s to control fungi and protect a wide variety of food crops against damage from mold, mildew and fungal diseases.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s latest veto will play better in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> than at home, so it probably wo n't stand up when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes. But it may serve an administration purpose in the meantime. The bill <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected would make it easier for Chinese exchange students to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for up to four years. In his veto statement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called that a laudable objective and said he will have the same thing done administratively, without changing the law, `` preserving my ability to manage foreign relations.'' While the administration said all along that the bill was n't necessary, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> insisted on it in response to Chinese repression of pro-democracy dissidents last spring Sponsors of the student visa bill said the bloody crackdown that began in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> last June 4 is n't over yet. There are about 40,000 Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and more than 30,000 of them hold visas under which they are required to return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for at least two years before seeking new or longer stays in this country. After the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> crackdown and killings, the administration imposed limited sanctions aimed primarily at halting military sales and cooperation. Exchange student visas were extended for a year, so that no Chinese student would be required to leave before June 1990. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he will have Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> extend that stay for up to four years, supporters of the bill argue that will mean case-by-case handling, exposing individual students to retribution if they ever do go home. Because of the visa bill, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government has threatened to prevent college students from coming to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to study, and also have said it may permanently end the suspended Fulbright scholarship program under which Americans study in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` I want to see these exchanges continue because it is in the national interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to promote the exchange of technical skills and ideas between Chinese and Americans,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in his veto message, issued last Thursday just before he left for his <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> conferences with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` It is my hope that by acting administratively we will foster the continuation of these programs,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. There is no guarantee that the veto will satisfy the Chinese since the president said he will do what the bill required anyhow. And the measure probably will be passed again early next year. Because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is in recess until Jan. 23, the bill was killed by pocket veto when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> failed to sign it by Saturday. The votes are there to enact it again, whatever <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does. The bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 403 to 0, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> without a dissenting voice vote. Seventy-one senators, more than enough to override a veto, signed a letter urging the president to sign it. While he did n't take their advice, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used the veto message to `` reemphasize my commitment ... to never allow any action that would force the return of Chinese students if their lives or liberty are at risk.'' Chinese officials and educators insist that returning exchange students face no danger or persecution, but advocates of the bill say many of them would be in jeopardy. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said some would be forced to go underground lest they face imprisonment or death like the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> demonstrators The veto fit the advice former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> brought back from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after a six-day visit that ended Nov. 2. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an 18-page written report and met privately with the president and his top foreign policy aides to recommend efforts to improve relations, despite the suppression of the democracy movement. He said continuing sanctions would only strengthen reactionaries in the Chinese government. Even so, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> did n't anticipate the veto, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> probably had no choice politically but to sign congressional sanctions. The reasoning in <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> memo suggests that even an unsuccessful veto might help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in future dealings with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The former president, who sent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative after ties between the two nations were reopened in 1972, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s personal standing with the Chinese is a positive factor. `` In our sometimes very tense discussions, not one of the Chinese leaders had a negative word to say about President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said. `` They would sometimes blame the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the media and the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, but never the president.''

 Talking with <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> is a grand adventure. She has fierce energy and a jumpy, bawdy sense of humor. Her sentences go every which way but loose, full of digressions, asides and hard sayings. Such as: `` Football is an absolute metaphor for life. If you want nice, clean, let's - pretend sports, watch Technically, that has nothing to do with her latest venture. But it's the thought that counts. Her latest venture, on cable TV Thursday, is an Arts & amp; Entertainment version of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` The Rope.'' She, her fellow Tony-award winners <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Cariou </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> co-star in it. One of four adaptations of one-act plays by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwrights, Thursday's one-hour drama is, in the <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> custom, a poetic, bitter tale _ in this case one about a family torn by despair. She has known that world of well-scrivened gloom before. But it proved a particularly good deal in 1974. Then, several years after a string of so-so TV movies and a busted marriage to actor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Peppard </PERSON>, whom she refers to only as `` the husband,'' she went back to theater. It was part of a process of starting all over again, says <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, who'd been hailed as an actress of great promise when she won Broadway's <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> award in 1962 as the bouncy, nubile daughter in `` Take Her, She's Mine.'' Twelve years later, she says, `` the American Shakesepeare Festival and <PERSON> Tennessee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> saved me from being a third-rate television actress today with ` Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''' In that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> revival, she was acclaimed for her interpretation of <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON>, the Southern beauty married to an alcoholic. Herself a Southern beauty to whom time has been tender, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, 50, was born in <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and raised in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. She is a veteran, she says, of one semester at <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. She came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at 18 to model and appear in commercials. Then she studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse, paying the way by waiting tables and playing guitar, `` plunking a few chords and singing your odd songs.'' Possessed of a husky, well-modulated voice, she is not thought of as a singer. Still, she once appeared in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> production of a short-lived musical by her friend <PERSON> Dory </PERSON> <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> C </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and the Hollywood Sign.'' Her own assessment: `` I'm not your best singer of show tunes. I'm a pretty good country singer, though, and I was a great rock' n' roll screamer.'' She said all this and more when interviewed in her favorite bistro, where she periodically lit a cigarette and cheerfully denounced both yuppies and no-smoking fiends who've ruined most bistros. Her life, which includes a son, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Peppard </PERSON>, now 21, has taken a goodly measure of ups and downs. Ten years ago, after she'd taken a few years off to go sailing and ponder the cosmos and such, it was down time She had all the goodies, she says _ a house in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, two lofts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a couple of costly foreign cars. But there was only $ 83 in the till. She rented out the house, sold the cars, and awaited developments. She got a call for a Broadway part. It was as the chain-smoking psychiatrist in what proved a hit, `` Agnes of God.'' `` That was God kissing me on the cheek,'' she says. `` The second time around.'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, who this year filmed an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie, `` Orleans,'' and starts off-Broadway rehearsals next month on `` When She Danced,'' about dancer <PERSON> Isadora </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, spent 14 months on Broadway in `` Agnes of God.'' Then, she says, she spent 40 more weeks on the road, touring in the play. More than a few actors hate touring. Not <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>. `` I like the road,'' she says. `` It's great to be in a Broadway hit and a long run. But they know where you are then, and people start calling you and asking you to do things like'' _ she laughed and winced _ `` lunch.''

<HEAD>Equity Rich, Cash Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As much as $ 750 billion of equity is held by homeowners who are 65 years or older, a category in which financial stress is rising because, among other things, of higher taxes and health care costs. In some instances, older couples meet expenses only by reducing their lives to the bare elements, or worse, while simultaneously sitting atop six figures of housing assets. They are well off _ but cash poor. The situation, always a cause of distress among social workers, government officials and others concerned with the elderly, is becoming even more so as large numbers of people enter the upper age categories. Simultaenously, the houses in which they live sometimes continue to rise in value, creating an even more pronounced contrast between cash flow and value tied up in real estate. Repeated attempts to resolve the dilemma have been made over the years, but no private-sector mortgage lender, insurer or other financial institution has marketed a popular solution. Two of the great fears are clearly revealed in surveys: 1. having enough money to live on, and 2. having to move from the Among the possible solutions now available: 1. Sell the house and with the proceeds move into a retirement community. For many people this is a practical solution, but it does n't help those who want to remain right where they are. 2. Sale-leaseback. The house is sold, but the former owners remain where they are. They obtain a guarantee of residency. Money from the sale is invested, and some of it may be used to pay the rent. Drawback: Insecurity resulting from unknowns, chief of which is the ability to make a sufficient return on investments to make monthly rental payments. 3. Home equity line of credit. This enables the owners to draw on home equity to meet unanticipated expenses. The drawback is fear of exhausting the credit line because of living expenses or longevity. 4. Reverse mortgage. Under this plan, monthly sums are withdrawn from the equity and, along with a charge, sent by the lending institution to the owner. In the best of them, the owner receives written assurance of lifetime tenure. Still, there are drawbacks. If the reverse mortgage is for a fixed term, rather than for life, the monthly income is higher, but the assurance of a roof over the head is gone. Lifetime tenure, in effect a reverse annuity mortgage, reduces insecurity but pays relatively little each month. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> estimates that for a 70-year-old borrower, a reverse mortgage on a $ 100,000 home at 10 percent produces $ 654 a month for five years or $ 411 for a 10-year period. However, if the reverse mortgage is for lifetime tenure, the monthly amount drops sharply to $ 278. Actuarial tables suggest strongly that, if possible, it might be wise to delay implementing a reverse mortgage. At age 75, for example, the 5-year note would pay $ 812, the 10-year mortgage $ 510, and the tenure mortgage $ 367. An encouraging development, but largely experimental, is offered through certain lenders by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which has agreed to insure 2,500 reverse mortgages through September 1991. The issue, however, is much larger than that, and it will become more so as the population ages, the equity piles up and the need to use it becomes pressing. What's needed is the proper product.

 The changes sweeping Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are reshaping the Continent. Suddenly the old bipolar equation _ <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ has been overturned by the rebirth of an older geographical entity called <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The script is having to be rewritten almost every week. Will <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> become Western democracies? Will the Germanys be united? And if united, will the German colossus once again threaten <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s stability? To try to answer some of these questions, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> asked five West European commentators to contribute their thoughts. The following overview, the first of five articles, was written by <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> G.V </PERSON>.

 Thursday, Nov. 9, the day the East German authorities allowed their citizens to travel freely to the West, marks the simultaneous end of the Cold War and the emergence of the `` German question'' as the decisive issue of European politics. The lifting of the Iron Curtain is cause for celebration and euphoria. At the same time the strategic and political ramifications are enormous, and therefore it is also cause for sober reflection and what the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> foreign minister has called `` constructive alertness.'' The bipolar structures of the Cold War effectively displaced deep-seated national and ethnic rivalries in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and replaced them with a security system which was, for all its many faults, relatively stable and predictable. One of the crucial features of this security order was the division of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which provided a degree of reassurance to many of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s traditional opponents. Today, however, the old certainties and assumptions of the postwar period are disintegrating under the combined impact of the changes _ associated above all with perestroika in the East, and the 1992 abolition of internal tariff barriers in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. This is nowhere more apparent than in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where, as the Cold War divisions fade away, older patterns of cooperation and conflict are re-emerging. Changes in this sensitive region, however, inevitably open the <PERSON> Pandora </PERSON>'s box of the `` German question,'' which is now the central issue of European politics. The `` German question'' predates the division of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and stems from the difficulty of integrating German power into the European interstate system. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has traditionally been the fulcrum of the European balance of power, and this is why the recent assertion of `` people power'' in the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> has led to so much discussion about the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The reform process in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will inevitably entail a qualitative change in inner-German relations, and therefore a substantial shift in the balance of power in continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The worries are twofold: First, there is the immediate concern about <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s growing economic, political and military weight in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> This has already been felt within the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, where the West Germans have shown themselves willing and able to assert their national interests, on economic and financial matters as well as over the issue of modernizing Short-range Nuclear Forces. In Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> economic and political influence has been expanding as the military and political dominance of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has declined. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is now well placed, geographically, economically and culturally, to benefit from the new markets and investment opportunities opened up by the reform movements in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. At the same time, the `` renewal'' movement in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will inevitably bring the two German states closer together, particularly in the economic sphere, thereby facilitating West German penetration of the rest of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> is thus set to become both an economic and a political giant in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> politics. Second, there is the fear that in the long term a reunified, centralized German nation-state -LRB- a `` Fourth Reich'' -RRB- could emerge. Its precondition would be the collapse of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as a viable political and economic entity. This gives rise to two possible scenarios. First, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> simply expanding to absorb <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, while remaining a member of both the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. This would be unacceptable to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and might unbalance economic and political relations within the Western alliance. The second possibility is that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, faced with a disintegrating East German state, might decide to make the best of a bad deal, and allow <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to unite and remain a member of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, provided it became fully denuclearized and all foreign troops withdrew from German soil. This might be acceptable to the Germans, but it would spell the end of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> as an effective military alliance. In order to assuage fears of a reunited and resurgent `` Fourth Reich,'' therefore, it is essential that the West collectively formulate a strategy for managing the changes in <LOCATION> East-Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and in inner-German relations. Above all, a broader European framework must be forged within which the `` German question'' can be successfully managed. This involves recognizing that the self-determination of the German people does not necessarily entail reunification, and that the central issue in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at the moment is the democratization of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Also, a unified or confederated <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would only be acceptable to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s neighbors in the context of a European Community that is both well advanced along the path toward economic and political union, and that is open to new forms of cooperation and association with other democracies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Within this broader European framework, German power could be diffused upward to the supranational institutions of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and downward to its own regional governments.

 Initial comment on the extraordinary events that culminated in the breach of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall tended to dwell on the damage these developments might inflict on the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The Federal Republic, it has been suggested, would now be much more interested in reunification than in Western European integration. Every mark spent in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> was one less mark available for <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. Encouraged perhaps by calculations of this kind, those who were opposed anyway to speeding up the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> integration process by, for example, the convening of an intergovernmental conference on economic and monetary union seized the occasion offered by the events in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and elsewhere to counsel caution. Now was not the time, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and her allies proclaimed, for the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> to dwell on its own internal problems when so much was happening beyond its frontiers. These early reactions are beginning to appear rather superficial. None of us, it should be stressed, has much idea of how events will develop in the East. They are beyond our control. They also seem to be beyond the control of either government or opposition leaders. The reunification issue is an example. Sober reflection a few days after the Wall came down suggested that speculation about prospects for German unity was largely a Western phenomenon. A few days later, banners in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> proclaiming unification as a highly desirable objective complicated the picture yet again. Where the East is going and how quickly remains uncertain. These uncertainties have not, however, prevented the emergence of a fairly widespread consensus among Western European leaders themselves that in the new circumstances the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>, far from being redundant, is the indispensable cornerstone of any new European system. This consensus, manifested at the highest levels at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> dinner party for the heads of government and state of the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> member countries in November rests on various assumptions: _ That the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is the surest framework within which the Germans themselves can pursue an active policy toward the East and eventually perhaps achieve reunification _ That in a period in which the emphasis in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations is bound to rest on economic and non-military matters, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is best placed to coordinate and channel Western aid and technical assistance _ That in a broader perspective, the Community can and should be seen not only as the most appropriate basis for the European pillar of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> alliance, but also as the indispensable Western pillar in a new European security system in which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will remain a military superpower regardless of what happens to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact Against this background, it is now possible to see the Eastern developments as a catalyst of Western integration. In the new circumstances, <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> leaders are almost sure to demonstrate their determination to continue with their own progress toward union: Economic and <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> is the obvious practical initiative, for which highly developed plans already exist. In any case, it is already obvious that the Community will be at the center of a number of high profile efforts to assist the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> directly. These economic and technical means will furthermore be backed up by even more conspicuous political initiatives involving, as President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> implied after the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> summit, visits to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the highest level. Finally, the acceleration of events and the obvious intention of <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> leaders to play an active role can only strengthen those elements in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration who already see the Community collectively as the ideal long-term partner with whom to discuss not only economic issues, but also political and security questions. For those committed to the further development of <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> union, these prospects can only be highly gratifying. There are, however, serious dangers that the West European themselves should be the first to recognize and deal with: _ A stronger <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> organized through the European Community can and should be a major asset to the Western Alliance It is not, however, as currently organized, in any practical sense linked to the alliance machinery. _ More important, a stronger <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that is a magnet to the East almost certainly will be seen in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a potential threat, ready in the worst case to gobble up dissident members of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact However unfounded these fears may be, the Community should take active steps to reassure the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and to cooperate with it.

 Last Nov. 9, 1989, East German authorities decided to open their borders with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. By now almost half the population in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has traveled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> or to the Federal Republic to see for themselves what this capitalist society really is like. More important, this mass migration westward turned into an emotional get-together of the Germans, not just for those who had not seen their relatives for many years, but for everybody. Undoubtedly, the opening of the border, symbolized spectacularly by the instantaneous scrapping of large sections of the hideous Wall, was a tactical move of the Communist authorities intended to open a safety valve and head off the constant stream of demonstrations in almost all major cities in the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. This strategy may perhaps still succeed in part, but all the same the situation has changed fundamentally. The peaceful mass demonstrations have above all achieved one thing: Suddenly the fear, instilled by an oppressive police state for so many years, has given way to a new self-confidence. The momentous events not only in the GDR, but in <LOCATION> East-Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> may perhaps be called the beginning of a Third Democratic Revolution -LRB- the first was the age from 1760 to 1800 highlighted by the American and French revolutions, and the second by the gradual, though not continuous advance of democratic government in the West since the beginning of the 20th century -RRB-. For one, Marxist-Leninist ideology is discredited. The highly bureaucratic and oppressive system of a centrally directed socialist economy, which had been established in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> perhaps more effectively than anywhere else, has failed disastrously. Just a few people on the top, so it emerges, were capable of making far-reaching decisions affecting the economic performance of a whole country without any effective control and almost wholly on ideological grounds. Now democratization has become unavoidable by any standards. Besides, the crumbling of the Wall will imply that the East German economy can no longer be run in isolation. Between the two German states, economic cooperation on the governmental and private levels as well as much economic help will be needed to forestall a complete breakdown of the economy and mass deprivation in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, something that would be in nobody's interest. This may require establishing special links between the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. It remains to be seen whether in the medium term these will devolve into a sort of German confederation, as seems likely, or whether they will be kept on an informal level that does not affect the statehood of either of the two Germanys. Right now the people from both Germanys are reluctant to go any further. The West Germans do not want to weaken the close political and economic ties they have established with the West. Neither are they prepared to abandon the alliances with the West, even though the danger of an aggression from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may become remote. Instead they hope that all steps regarding the intensification of the relations with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as well as with the other East-Central European countries, will be done in full cooperation with their Western partners. The time may be ripe for a second Marshall Plan, this time to be organized on an international level, with the active participation not only of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, but possibly also <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It all depends, however, on what happens in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> itself. West Germans are now perhaps more than ever interested in making things easier for <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in order to see his reform policies succeed. For they are fully aware that all depends upon whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will tolerate the process of democratization in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and in particular in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Come what may, the democratic revolution under way in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, and now <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, will change the course of history. A return to the old ways of a bureaucratic socialism seems unlikely. The national idea, long believed to be gradually supplanted by the European idea, seems to have a remarkable revival. However, it may no longer be quite the dangerous creature to which we have grown accustomed in the 1920s and 1930s. Rather it is a nationalism that believes in a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of free nations.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is in, but not of, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. She did not share the psychology of the original six who founded the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in 1958 _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Federal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, all of whom suffered from fascism and enemy occupation For them, World War II showed that the nation-state had to be overcome through the creation of supranational institutions. For <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the war meant the triumph of the nation-state _ her finest hour. Not feeling ashamed of her past, she felt assured of her future as a global superpower, the center of a worldwide empire rather than a middle-ranking European country. She has always known that sooner or later she will have to put aside her ambivalence and decide whether to join the Continent or stand aside. The cataclysmic changes in central and eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ought to bring this moment of truth closer. Although the late French president <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> did his best to keep <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> out of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, the British approach to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has always been Gaullist. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> favors a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of cooperating but sovereign independent nations, rather than any pooling of sovereignty. Entering the Community in 1973, she thought she was joining merely a customs union rather than a dynamic organization whose purpose was European union. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has given forceful expression to this conception of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Superficially, the changes in central and eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> make the British government's case for a loosely organized Community more plausible. For if Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is being unraveled, what is the sense in continuing with the creation of a closed Community in the West? Instead, so the British argument goes, new forms of association need to be created that can bridge the ever-narrowing ideological gap between West and East. It would be parochial to concentrate on the machinery of integration _ exchange rates, monetary union and the like _ when the solid scaffolding of the <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> we knew is disintegrating before our eyes This conception, in the view of most of the other governments in the Community, ignores the vastly increased danger of instability in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The withdrawal of Communism is likely to bring to the surface all kinds of national conflicts, submerged since the war through the might of the Soviet Empire. In particular, a reunited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which now looks a distinct possibility, could threaten the balance of power in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It especially frightens the Poles, whose frontiers, in the absence of a peace treaty, have still to be finally agreed; and the French, invaded three times by <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the past 120 years. The French, therefore, are in the vanguard of those arguing that German reunification can only be safely attempted if <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> becomes fully integrated into the European Community. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> does not share this fear of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Less traumatized by World War II, she was more willing to forgive and forget. Less scarred by history, she finds it difficult to imagine a reunited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as anything other than benign. Traditionally, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s role in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has been to stand apart, preserving the balance of power against the attempt of any single power to dominate the Continent That remains the instinct of many leading British Conservatives. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has recently taken a distinctly more pro-European stance. Yet this transformation of attitudes _ it was the Conservatives who took <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> into the Community, while as recently as 1983 Labor was promising withdrawal from it _ owes as much to hostility toward Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as to genuine European conviction. There are signs that attitudes are changing. Survey evidence earlier this year suggested that 55 percent of the British electorate regarded the Community as a `` good thing,'' the highest figure since <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> joined. The Euro-elections, which were catastrophic for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, showed that there is no longer a strong anti-European constituency in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. It remains to be seen whether the convulsions in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will finally convince the public that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is essentially a European power. Eventually, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will have to make a decision of principle _ whether she wishes to be part of the new political entity being created in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, or remain an offshore island devoid of both power and influence.

 Is communism dead? Everyone knows that communism is not confined geographically to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A billion Chinese and millions of Vietnamese, Laotians, Ethiopians, Romanians, Afghans and Cubans still live under communist regimes that have remained Stalinist or become born-again Stalinists. The Cambodian conflict is not between communism and democracy but rather between two types of communism. At the end of 1989, there were still 50,000 Cuban soldiers in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> protecting a non-elected communist power. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s economy has been destroyed in a disastrous experiment with Marxism and by the civil war that followed. Many quasi-Marxist regimes _ in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ continue to starve their populations and start wars, at home or with their neighbors or both. I firmly believe that communism is dying. But communism is far from having disappeared. There is no doubt communism is fading rapidly in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where it has never been accepted and where it has always been seen as an imported system, imposed and maintained artificially by a foreign power. When the threat of military repression became highly unlikely, thanks to the policies of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the desire for democracy could explode freely. So can we say the Cold War is over, as the current phrase has it? Not quite. For what is the Cold War? It was the direct result of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s annexation of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, freed from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and immediately re-occupied by that same <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> What does <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> say? That these countries can become political democracies with market economies provided they remain in the same geostrategic and diplomatic framework as the Cold War. In other words, if they regain their internal freedom, these countries remain satellites as far as foreign policy is concerned, for the time being anyway. This is the position <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been pushing hard and it has been accepted by the West. Generally known as `` Finlandization,'' it is much more than that for the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> is not directly included in Soviet military calculations and does not have Soviet troops stationed in its territory. One can foresee that the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> agreements _ never freely negotiated by the peoples concerned _ will have to be re-examined by their future democratic governments, eager to become sovereign states once again. As for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the major new element is the failure of perestroika. No one in the West seems to have clearly grasped this, but every Soviet citizen now takes it for granted _ even economists in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s entourage. For nearly five years, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader has tried to get the Soviet economy back on its feet by using a `` market socialism'' formula which injects a little pragmatism and profit motive in an overall structure that remains intact. Result: In 1985, the situation was bad; today it is catastrophic. Communism can be discarded; it can not be repaired. That is, if you begin to really repair it, you quickly realize that the only way out is dropping it altogether. That's what has happened in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. That's what <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> refused to do, resorting to mass terror. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has not made a clear choice between capitalism with private property or the return to Stalinist collectivism.

 Ill-led, ill-trained, plagued by corruption and desertion, the army of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> found itself relegated to backwater skirmishes and hamlet defenses in its own war. The Americans, with half a million soldiers, had taken over, shouldering aside the people they had been sent to `` advise.'' But back home, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people lost their stomach for a war that seemed endless, pointless, unwinnable, and a new president, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, cast about for a way to get out without losing. He toyed with getting tougher. His defense secretary, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>, formerly a hawkish congressman from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, had a different idea. <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> called it `` de-Americanization,'' then changed that to `` Vietnamization.'' It was supposed to mean retreat without defeat. It provided that if talks under way in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> failed to bring peace to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the Vietnamese would be left to fight the war alone. `` Vietnamization'' would train them and supply them to take over _ just as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> once said, so many lives before. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, both in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, resisted <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>'s plan. They read Vietnamization as a slow road to disaster. They felt the South Vietnamese, alone, could not, in the jargon of the day, `` hack it.'' And so was fought a war-within-the-war, a battle between <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, on one side, and the military command in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and at military headquarters in the field on the other. It was a battle over whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could extract itself honorably from a war without winning it _ or at least get out of the business of fighting it. <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>, now an executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Readers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>, says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had little choice but to find a route out. `` I knew we had to withdraw,'' he said in a recent telephone interview. `` We could not continue Americanizing the war. We had to de-Americanize it. I got that into the Republican platform in 1968. The term Vietnamization _ I invented that. I named it.'' The story of the tug of war behind the <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> strategy is the chief topic of a new volume in a series of books by <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> historians on the American experience in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The book, `` The Final Years,'' by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, a civilian historian on the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>, documents how a defense secretary forced a resisting military establishment to give the war back to the South Vietnamese, telling details never previously revealed. It is part of a `` comprehensive and objective'' account of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s experience in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> which, even before the war had ended, the center had decided to produce. `` <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> proves beyond a shadow of a doubt what I had suspected and seen traces of in fragmentary documentary evidence 10 years ago but could n't really prove,'' says <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herring </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> professor and one of the country's leading historians of the war. Herring calls the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s accounts `` first-rate and balanced.'' `` It is remarkable that they could come out of an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> agency,'' he says. `` It reflects well on the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> had access to still-classified war records. He uses 19 pages to list his sources of information _ records from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military headquarters in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, the files of <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the debriefing papers of senior American officers and memoirs written by former Vietnamese military leaders at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. His thesis: <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forced both the idea and the timetable of Vietnamization upon a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military that felt what <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> demanded _ a plan to make <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> quickly capable of prosecuting the war alone _ was simply beyond <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s capacity to achieve. `` Despite the divergent view of the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies involved in the war effort and despite the unanimous opinion of these same agencies that the South Vietnamese could never deal with a combined <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnamese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> threat, the new administration had instructed the American military command to develop plans for turning over almost the entire ground war effort to the forces of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>,'' he wrote. Gen. <PERSON> Creighton </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commander, and his generals insisted that tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> would be required to stay behind in a support and air combat role if Vietnamization were to have any hope of staving off a communist victory. But <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> thought the military was stalling. He demanded a plan to extricate American troops. <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>, of course, prevailed. The withdrawals started in mid-1969, continued while <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> sought to reach an accord with the North Vietnamese in both secret and public four-party talks in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and ended in December 1973, with the last American troops brought home. Sixteen months later, the <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> peace process having collapsed, communists rolled triumphantly into <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> and the war was over. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had been elected in 1968 after promising to end the war. Seeking the Republican nomination, he said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> in February that if the war had not ended by Election Day `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will be justified to elect new leadership, and I pledge to you the new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>.'' He said he did not mean `` withdrawal from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' but contended the war `` can be ended'' if `` we mobilize our economic and political and diplomatic leadership.'' But he refused to elaborate, brushed aside all effort to draw him out. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s idea became known as his `` secret plan'' to end the war. Eighteen years had passed since the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid had gone to aid the French fight communist insurgents in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Nine years had passed since the first two American soldiers had been killed in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people had grown war-weary. Casualties kept rising but victory was not in sight and the <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> government was seen as dictatorial and corrupt. All told, 30,000 Americans had been killed in action by the time <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was sworn in; another 16,000 battle deaths were to occur during the withdrawals. In addition, 10,000 Americans died off the battlefields, mostly in planes that were shot down.

 `` <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had suggested the existence of a ` secret plan' to end the war during his presidential campaign,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> writes, but after three months in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> he `` had yet to come up with any alternatives to the application of greater force, and the secretary -LRB- <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> -RRB- felt that he had a better idea.'' Says <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> now: `` The ` secret plan' was in my head. ... Withdrawal was the only alternative we had and we had to do it in an orderly fashion. You could have had public support for the first two years, probably, but not beyond that.'' So on March 5, 1969, six weeks after <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s inauguration, <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> to present his concept of scheduled, systematic withdrawals _ to take place regardless of what was happening on the battlefield _ to <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a tank commander who in 1968 had succeeded Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> -LRB- MACV -RRB-. According to <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>'s account, the general balked, insisting `` that all withdrawals depend on his assessment of the military situation in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> backed up <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, setting the stage for a long struggle between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and MACV. <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>'s recollection is somewhat different. He says <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> might have made his objections known, but always ultimately went along with <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>. `` General <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> pointed out certain reasons why he thought the program I laid out was too rapid a withdrawal ... but he was more supportive of my withdrawal figures than were the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That's why I promoted <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff over the objections of the White House. They were not great <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> fans there.'' In any event, it was a struggle. Here's the story, as laid out in <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>'s official history: _ In March 1969 <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> returns from his visit to <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> and reports to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> that the size of the American contingency is actually stiffling South Vietnamese initiative He says the `` orientation'' of American military leaders `` seems to be more on operations than on assisting the South Vietnamese to acquire the means to defend themselves.'' That, he says, explains <ORGANIZATION> MACV </ORGANIZATION>'s tolerance of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s high military desertion rate and marginal military leadership. He says MACV has no program to reduce the American military commitment and contends `` the development of such a program should receive our first priority.'' He recommends withdrawing 50,000 to 75,000 soldiers in 1969. _ <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> approves tentative planning for withdrawing 50,000 soldiers but repeats `` his personal opposition to unilateral <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop withdrawals and his insistence that all withdrawals depend on his assessment of the military situation in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. _ In April 1969, <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s approval, embraces <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>'s concept and signs a directive instructing the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary to prepare `` a specific timetable for Vietnamizing the war. His directive foresees `` the progressive transfer ... of the fighting effort'' to South Vietnamese forces without insisting on an expansion of the South Vietnamese army _ and even without awaiting a reduction in the number of North Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> withdrawals are to start July 1. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to return to a support and advisory mission in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. _ In May, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> questions the size and pace of the projected withdrawals Gen. <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>, assures him that <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s July 1 target was picked only for planning purposes. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> says American redeployments will take into consideration the military situation. `` But <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> knew better and his concern proved justified,'' the book says. `` Only a few days after <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>'s second communique, he received notice that withdrawals might come sooner than expected and to prepare alternate plans for the redeployment of 50,000 and 100,000 troops.'' _ MACV reluctantly draws up a Vietnamization plan but it is based on the `` major assumption'' that about 275,000 support troops will remain following the withdrawal of most combat forces That insistence on maintaining a huge support contingent, <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> says, was `` the principal response of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military leaders to what seemed to be an impossible order'' from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In its war assessment, <ORGANIZATION> MACV </ORGANIZATION> advises <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the South Vietnamese will not be capable before 1972 of handling even the <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> _ not to mention the heavily armed and better-trained North Vietnamese _ and even then <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisory and materiel support will be required `` indefinitely.'' <ORGANIZATION> MACV </ORGANIZATION> says that until then the <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> forces `` simply are not capable of attaining the level of self-sufficiency and overwhelming force superiority that would be required to counter combined <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> insurgency and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vienamese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> main force offenses.'' _ In June, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> announces the withdrawal of the first 25,000 Americans He meets with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Thieu </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to discuss Vietnamization. `` <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> accepted <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> withdrawals as a political necessity,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> writes. But <PERSON> Thieu </PERSON> points out that the Americans had been preparing <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> merely, as <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> put it, `` to deal with a residual insurgency,'' not to square off against the strength of the entire North Vietnamese army. The South Vietnamese president asks for an immense increase in military equipment if his army is to fight both the Viet Cong insurgents and the North Vietnamese army _ heavy main battle tanks and missile tanks, howitzers, artillery, radar, anti-aircraft missiles, C-130 air transports and 95 other aircraft _ as well as the wherewithal for a big expansion of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s air, armor and artillery units. Additionally, <PERSON> Thieu </PERSON> wants a big injection of financial aid to improve the living standards of South Vietnamese servicemen. _ <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> advises <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> that most of <PERSON> Thieu </PERSON>'s requests are unneeded and, <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> wrote, `` too expensive and too complex for the South Vietnamese to manage by themselves. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> still assumes American units will provide air defenses, even under Vietnamization. `` He further advised <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that no new weapons be added to <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s arsenal until the South Vietnamese became able to operate and maintain them.'' He opposes <PERSON> Thieu </PERSON>'s request for financial support for South Vietnamese forces, arguing MACV should not be in the business of raising living standards `` for one segment'' of the population. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, agreeing, says <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s equipment is adequate in terms of `` the limited Vietnamese technical capability.'' Moreover, the book says, the chiefs say the Vietnamese had not addressed at Midway `` what <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> advisers considered key <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> military weaknesses _ poor leadership and high desertion rates.''

 _ In August <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> approves <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' proposals for increasing <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s strength In the interest of economy, he makes it clear that whatever money and equipment is provided to <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> is to come out of the budgets of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. He asks the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> `` to put together a new program that would enable the South Vietnamese to deal successfully with a combined Viet Cong-North Vietnamese threat,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> says. MACV is also told to come up with a plan to improve <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s leadership abilities and reduce desertions. _ In September MACV replies: Even the increases in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s forces will not enable them to handle a combined Viet Cong-North Vietnamese threat without direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat `` According to MACV, <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s armed forces could not be expanded beyond the presently authorized manpower ceiling of 993,000, nor could they be improved qualitatively to the extent necessary to deal with a combined threat,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> writes. `` What the secretary wanted simply could not be done ... Neither <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> nor his staff was able to suggest any changes in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s military organization, strategy or tactics that would enable the South Vietnamese to deal with a combined enemy threat.'' Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> commander, stresses the danger of overtaxing <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s manpower and training capacity. He tells <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> that `` further acceleration could prove self-defeating.'' _ November `` <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> refused to take no for an answer,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> says. The secretary orders the services for the third time to come up with a suitable plan and puts them on notice `` that a large residual support force was not in the offing.'' <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> wants an `` imaginative'' plan that, he says, will address the `` critical problems of corruption, leadership, motivation and morale.'' _ December MACV complies, drafting a more optimistic plan. It is based on the assumption, however, that there will be success for <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>'s expansion programs, progress on the battlefield and a declining <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnamese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> threat and it ignores <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s forces massed just outside the borders of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> But even this new plan is tied to the existence of a large American residual support force, and <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> says, <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>'s staff `` suspected that the military was still trying to use its evaluations of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> military capabilities to stall the withdrawal process.'' _ February, 1970 <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> revisits <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, communicates his disappointment over the lack of any new or fresh concepts. The South Vietnamese ask for more arms, including 175mm artillery pieces that can fire over the demilitarized zone into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and for financial assistance to raise soldiers' living standards. <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and asks the military for an even stronger plan. _ April The Joint Chiefs of Staff gives <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> what he wants _ and much of what <PERSON> Thieu </PERSON> is after. The new withdrawal plan gives <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> two 175mm artillery battalions and other equipment and separate ration supplements and dependent housing support for <PERSON> Thieu </PERSON>'s troops. With that, the Abrams-Laird struggle over Vietnamization ended. The withdrawals continued throughout 1971 and 1972 without a break. On the diplomatic front, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> signed the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Peace Accords on Jan. 27, 1973, removing the one remaining obstacle to total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> withdrawal _ <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s agreement to return American prisoners of war. The accords called for a cease-fire and set up an international body to police it, but the agreement was almost immediately violated and the war resumed. By the end of 1973, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military contingent in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was down to 50 men; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was left to fight its war alone. On Jan. 8, 1975, the North Vietnamese politburo ordered a major offensive to `` liberate'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> by a cross-border invasion. In March, in the face of the onslaught, <PERSON> Thieu </PERSON> withdrew his army from the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION>, a move that touched off countrywide panic. The cities of Hue and <LOCATION> Danang </LOCATION> fell. On April 11-13 the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy staff was evacuated by helicopter; on April 29, <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> fell to the North Vietnamese and the war ended. `` Vietnamization was not a stragegy for fighting or winning the war, or even for achieving <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s limited objectives in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' concludes <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>. `` At best, it was a political strategy for continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for a domestically unpopular conflict and, at worst, a face-saving abandonment of a commitment that American leaders felt they could or should no longer honor.'' Says <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>: `` There was no other alternative. We had 570,000 men on the ground in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. We had 2 million <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel supporting them. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was fed up with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and so were the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. The lesson from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> should be that we should follow the advice that President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> gave when the French failed in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ never get involved in ground warfare in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.''

 Compeer. The word means `` equal, companion, friend, peer.'' It's also the name of an organization that uses friendship as therapy for the mentally disturbed. The group matches volunteers with clients for one-on-one get-togethers each week for a year. While there have been no scientific evaluations of the program, mental health experts say it does seem to help.

 In 1976, <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON> weighed 325 pounds. She was divorced, unemployable, estranged from her family and confined to a state hospital in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y. Her grim history included a feeling at age 9 that something was terribly wrong with her. At that age, she did n't know she was a victim of severe depression and its devastating consequences. But she was to learn soon enough. She attempted suicide half a dozen times, beginning at age 16. She was frequently hospitalized for her mental illness. She had her stomach stapled to lose weight and was admitted to a group home. But the demons of overwhelming depression won again. Her spirit was broken, her fragile self-esteem shattered. She was hospitalized yet again. Life in a state hospital seemed her destiny. Now 41, <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> today weighs 155 pounds. She has her own apartment with new furniture. She earned an associate degree in college, bought a new car she calls `` Baby,'' and has a new job. She is out of therapy and off all medication. Was it a miracle? No, it was nature's medicine _ friendship. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittmershaus </PERSON>, 33, a research physicist, was the friend. She befriended <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> until <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> was well enough to be her own friend. But <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON>'s paths probably would never have crossed were it not for an unusual non-profit organization called Compeer. `` Compeer is the best anti-depressant in the world,'' <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> says. Its premise is simply the power of friendship. Headquartered in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, Compeer began with 10 patients and 10 volunteers and was called `` Adopt-A-Patient.'' In 1976, <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Skirboll </PERSON> answered a help-wanted ad and took over. She found the name too patronizing and thumbed through her dictionary. She found `` compeer.'' The definition: `` equal, companion, friend, peer.'' In 1977, <PERSON> Skirboll </PERSON> registered the name with the federal government, began raising money and expanded it to an organization that has helped more than 10,000 mentally and emotionally handicapped people in 119 cities in 37 states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The friend, the compeer, contracts to spend one hour a week with the client for a year. The volunteers undergo brief training. They meet with a therapist if indicated and submit written monthly reports. Mrs. <PERSON> Skirboll </PERSON> says the backup support for each volunteer costs about $ 450 a year, about what it would cost to keep a patient in a hospital for three days. The program exists from <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, as well as in smaller cities like <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and Great Bend, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. Each has its own budget, some as high as $ 150,000, but the national norm is $ 25,000 <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> decided to go public with her story to try to eradicate the stigma the mentally ill suffer. Her story is that of a product of a broken home, a survivor of foster homes and a father she could never please. `` I could have become president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and it would not have been good enough for him,'' she says. `` I carried that attitude into my adult life.'' She has n't seen her father or spoken to him or any of her four sisters in the last 10 years, although they all live within 50 miles. Her mother is dead. `` The last time I spoke to him, he said the next thing he wanted to hear about me was that I was dead,'' <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> recalls. `` I told him I would abide by his wishes, but that I still loved him. His voice cracked a little and he said, ` OK. Goodbye.''' `` I got married at 20 for all the wrong reasons,'' she says. `` I did n't love him, but I was fat and ugly and I knew no one else would ever ask me.'' The marriage lasted eight years. By the time <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> met <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> in 1983, she was living in a halfway house, but she was thinking of returning to the state hospital, to the wards she knew all too well. <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> was in the state hospital when she was paired with her first compeer, a woman who stayed with her for six years, but then moved from <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> and they lost touch. <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> arranged for <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> to take over <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON>'s case. But after the second or third visit, <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> told <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> not to bother to come back.

 `` I did everything I could to sabotage the relationship,'' <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> says. `` I would n't talk to her sometimes when she came.'' Other times, she would just cry, but she could n't articulate what was wrong. But <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> was as tenacious as <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON>. She just kept coming back. Eventually, they started going out for coffee, they fed ducks on a pond, they went window-shopping, they went to the circus, to movies. `` I finally started talking a little bit,'' <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> recalls. `` I would ask her why she would want to come and see me. Why should anyone care about me? She showed me what a true friend is. Since <PERSON> Janice </PERSON>, I know what a relationship is.'' <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> wanted to return to the hospital. She felt she could n't make it on the outside <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> kept saying, `` Yes, you can,'' words that eventually <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> came to believe. When <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> started college, as <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> was studying for her master's degree, they would often study together. After <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> got her degree, she had about 35 interviews before she finally got a job. After she had been with <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> for three years, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON>'s husband left the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> for a job in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON>'s friendship, while no longer an official compeer match, has survived. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> calls <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> about twice a month and <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> writes to her. Last year for her birthday, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> and her husband sent <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> a round-trip ticket to spend two weeks with them in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> no longer has, or needs, an official compeer. She has made a few friends on her own, always with <PERSON> Janice </PERSON>'s encouragement. <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON>, blessed with a gift for public speaking, volunteers as a speaker for Compeer. She tells her audience she is going to talk about a mentally ill person. She then gives her own life story. Compeer has become more sophisticated than it was in the early days and tries to match people with something in common. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> really had nothing in common, but one example in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> reflects the extent to which Compeer now tries to make these friendship dates work. Both the volunteer and the client were originally from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and both very interested in music, especially reggae, the music of the island. And so <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bent </PERSON>, 39, a victim of schizophrenia, became the friend of <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, 22, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smalls </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Macedonia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the Compeer director at the <ORGANIZATION> Upper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> brought the two together about four months ago. Bent, whose disease dates back to his student days in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, has very few friends and is frightened to leave the house. The voices that bedevil him, despite medication, get louder, the hallucinations become three dimensional. If he is with someone, however, it is easier. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> brings records and videos to the four-story walk-up Bent shares with his wife and five children. Despite the age difference, both are students in their own way. On one of their recent visits, <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> asked if Bent knew anything about the Dutch philosopher <PERSON> Spinoza </PERSON>, the subject of one of his classes that afternoon. It turned out he did. So instead of listening to music as usual, the two chatted about philosophy. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, director of community support for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Compeer </PERSON> `` seems to be very effective.'' `` Everybody who has been involved with them has nothing to say but good about them,'' says <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. He adds, however, there has not been an objective and scientific evaluation of the program. The studies in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, where the program began, indicate Compeer significantly cuts the rate of a patient's re-entry to an institution. Sixty percent of previously hospitalized patients return at some point, according to mental health professionals. Among the Compeer clients, that number has dropped to 15 percent, <PERSON> Skirboll </PERSON> says. Although Compeer gets some government money, it also gets donations from such corporations as <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, says he has 80 Compeer volunteers working in the hospital, a facility with 500 patients and 200 outpatients. `` It's a wonderful way to transition a patient from the hospital to a halfway house or group home,'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> says.

 East will meet West on the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Keio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, an experimental academy that will teach the children of Japanese executives posted in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The school, on the grounds of <ORGANIZATION> Manhattanville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in this suburb of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is scheduled to open in September 1990. Construction of a classroom and administrative building, a gymnasium, cafeteria and dormitories began in the fall. <ORGANIZATION> Keio </ORGANIZATION> was conceived as a way to attract Japanese businesses to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. But it is now seen as an important educational effort in its own right _ an experiment in bilingual, bicultural education that could help expand the horizons of education in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The school is a bellwether for the state, if not the country,'' says <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, the regional representative on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION>, the state's educational policy board. `` It could become an instant model.'' The catalyst for the creation of the school was concern about the education of the children of the growing number of Japanese businessmen who work in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. An estimated 20,000 to 30,000 live in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> alone, the most in any area of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yasumitsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nihei </PERSON>, who will be principal of the new school, says the average stay of the Japanese businessman once was about five years. But now they're staying longer, and the needs of their college-bound children are more important. Most Japanese children want to attend a university in their homeland `` to be mainstream in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Nihei </PERSON>. In many cases, workers stay with a single company all their lives, and to get into that company they must get into the right school, he says. But to get into the university, students must pass an examination. All of their previous education from the second grade on is geared toward drilling them with the facts necessary to pass that test. They attend school eight hours a day, 5 -LCB- days a week, 240 days a year. By comparison, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students attend six hours a day, five days a week for about 180 days a year. And American schools concentrate less on the rote memorization that is commonplace at Japanese schools. There is an elementary school based on the Japanese system in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But until recently, high school students often were sent home to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Meiji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gakuin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> plans to open a traditional Japanese high school in <LOCATION> Sweetwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where 70 Japanese-owned companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON>, have operations. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynam </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> had seized on the establishment of a school to help Japanese businessmen already here and attract more. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Keio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was consulted. <PERSON> Matilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, the governor's wife, even visited the university during negotiations. They settled on <LOCATION> Manhattanville </LOCATION> as the site of the new school because it was close to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and because <LOCATION> Manhattanville </LOCATION> has a sister school in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the University of the Sacred Heart. Half the faculty in the new school will be <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and the curriculum will cull the best from the American school system, particularly an emphasis on writing, which is more American than Japanese. The curriculum will meet graduation requirements of both <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and an outstanding student at the school would be assured entry into <ORGANIZATION> Keio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> without the dreaded exam. While it is expected that Japanese students will make up most of the student body, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students will not be excluded. Entrance into the school will be based on an exam, grades, bilingual ability demonstrated in written essays, letters of recommendation and extracurricular activities. The school will operate on two semesters and will accommodate both the Japanese school year, which runs April to March, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> school year. Tuition is projected at $ 12,000 a year, room and board at $ 4,000. Manhattanville President <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said students from her school will student-teach at the school or work in labs there. Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON>, superintendent of <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> schools, is also looking forward to a partnership with his Asian neighbor. In his district, 6.7 percent of the district's 2,166 students are Asian, mostly Japanese, but only 24 students in the <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> high school system are <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> currently offers a bilingual program for Japanese students at its <ORGANIZATION> Parsons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's an opportunity for us to share programs, for both of us to learn,'' <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> says. `` Some of our Japanese students prefer the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> experience and want to go to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Keio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which is investing $ 40 million in the school, including $ 9.5 million to buy 27 acres of the <LOCATION> Manhattanville </LOCATION> campus, feels the experiment could pay dividends at home. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is in an age of internationalization,'' says <PERSON> Nihei </PERSON>, who hopes the school's success will lead to similar programs elsewhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 The <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> family of <PERSON> Shiner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is health conscious in a big way.

That's not to mention the female side of the family, which includes a nurse, a dietician and a respiratory therapist.

 There's Dr. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, as they are known around town. And do n't forget their brother, Dr. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, who just retired. Then there are those soon-to-be doctors, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s grown sons. And <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>'s youngest son, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, a pre-med student. `` It's kind of contagious,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> about what is, in every sense, a family practice. Since the early 1970s, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and his younger brothers, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, have been the only physicians in this town, best known for its beer brewery. Practicing medicine in a small town is not easy. But the <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> clan loves it. `` People say thank you,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> says. `` You get a lot of gifts. You get a lot of food. You get turkeys and chickens and pies and cakes. `` To me, somebody that's going to go out of their way to pay for a service and then ante up something ... That's very gratifying.'' The 2,000 townspeople in <LOCATION> Shiner </LOCATION> have depended on the <ORGANIZATION> Wagners </ORGANIZATION> for everything from surgery to treating the flu to delivering babies. The <ORGANIZATION> Wagners </ORGANIZATION> have delivered an estimated 4,500 to 5,000 babies, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, 54, retired last year for health reasons. Now <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>, 63, and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, 59, keep the medical practice going, attending to 40 patients a day and taking turns treating the sick and doing emergency room shifts at a nearby community hospital. Most patients visit the <ORGANIZATION> Wagners </ORGANIZATION>' clinic for appointments, but the doctors still do what most physicians gave up years ago. They make house calls. `` We stay very, very busy,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> says. Their bustling office in downtown <PERSON> Shiner </PERSON> is housed in an old school building. In the waiting room is a portrait of the man who started it all: <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, the father of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>. He was _ not surprisingly _ a doctor. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> recalls local residents contacted his father at all times of the day and night for medical care, and his father always responded. `` He went to Mass and Communion every day. When he lost a patient he would almost lose his mind,'' <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> recalls. `` I guess we just had a real good man to identify with.'' Even though he was deeply devoted to Roman Catholicism, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> was known to respect the beliefs of others. `` He would always prescribe wine for the Baptists and Methodists,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> says, with a smile. `` They went right along with it _ for medicinal purposes.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> was so special in town that the local hospital was named for him. His sons lament the hospital was forced to close last year after struggling to survive. Its beds did n't remain full, and it fell prey to today's Medicare reimbursement system that pays a set amount for a diagnosis, no matter the cost of the service. Now <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> travel to <ORGANIZATION> Yoakum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> about 10 miles from <LOCATION> Shiner </LOCATION> to care for patients. The brothers are trying to recruit a new doctor for their practice. Then <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> will consider retiring, he says. But trying to get a young physician to come to a small town is n't easy. `` The ones who like to hunt and fish and drive a tractor on their days off will come on down,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> says. But the three <ORGANIZATION> Wagners </ORGANIZATION> returned to their hometown, even after studying medicine at prestigious <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> medical schools. More Wagners are starting to follow in their footsteps. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> says he never encouraged his four sons to go to medical school. In fact, he says, `` I tried to discourage them from going into medicine, but to no avail.'' Now <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> is completing his residency in <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> are in medical school in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, is studying pre-med at Notre Dame. The <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> family's interest in health care does n't end there. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>'s wife is a dietician, a daughter is a nurse and another daughter is a respiratory therapist. A sister of the <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> brothers has eight children, and two of them are doctors.

 It's hard to imagine devoting one's life to penetrating the forbidding walls of a prison and trying to reach the hearts of convicts, but this <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> woman does it and her message is: `` I am me and I am good cuz God do n't make junk.''

 `` People think these boys are just throwaways, that they're getting what they deserve. I think the public needs to know that God is behind prison walls.'' That's the feeling of <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who with accordion and Bible in hand walks through prison doors each Sunday to try to inspire even the most hardened inmates. In a drafty room once used as a barracks for prisoners, the spry grandmother of two stands before about 100 uniformed inmates at Camp Sauble, the state's only boot-camp-style corrections facility. `` My heart is behind the prison doors with you,'' she says to the men, most of them repeat offenders under age 25. After having former drill instructors bark orders in their face all week, many of the young men crack a smile for the first time since the previous Sunday. `` When I first came here, I did n't want to go to church services,'' says inmate <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Dowagiac </LOCATION>, who was sent to Camp Sauble on a breaking and entering conviction. `` But when you see her, it brings your spirits up and makes you feel better for the rest of the week.'' `` I'm glad my Mom made me take accordion lessons, because it's opened quite a lot of prison doors,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> says with a chuckle One of her hymns she wrote herself, and it sums up her message: `` I am me and I am good cuz God do n't make junk.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> began her mostly musical church services at Camp Sauble in 1984, two years after she took early retirement from a 17-year career as a case worker with the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. When she's not at Camp Sauble on Sunday, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> can be found at other <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> prisons. She plays monthly at the minimum-security prison at <LOCATION> Cassidy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> near <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> and at the <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION> medium-security facility in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. She's also a regular visitor at several other prisons, including camps Cusino and Ojibway in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and camps <PERSON> Pellston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pugsley </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. Attendance at <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' services usually runs a remarkable 98 percent, compared with about 10 percent at most prisons across the state, officials say. Those who choose not to attend must stay in their cells for `` quiet time.'' Most weeks, the only inmates not in attendance are those who are banned as punishment, guards say. Prison officials say <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' services seem to touch many of the inmates. `` They really put their heart and soul in the services,'' says Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. `` That Sunday service gives them the drive to complete the week.'' Accompanied by her brother on the banjo, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' songs are upbeat, an inspiration to the offenders who have been given 90 days to change their ways. If they fail, they are sent to a conventional prison, usually with a much longer sentence. There are the traditional hymns, such as `` Amazing Grace,'' and within a few minutes, nearly every one of the men is clapping and singing along in thunderous voices as <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> belts out the tunes on her accordion. After every song they roar their approval. A brief Christian service follows. Inmates read along with their donated Bibles and bow their shaved heads in prayer. A guard patrols the room. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' musical prowess also includes the piano, organ and guitar. In her 20s, she sang in an all-girl dance band in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, where she grew up. Besides her commitment to people behind bars, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> deviates from the stereotypical grandmother image in other ways. She recently sold her motorcycle, which had earned her the nickname `` Motorcycle Mama'' among friends. `` I never had the time to ride it,'' she says. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' first prison performance came when a fellow male member at her Assembly of God church who had been playing guitar for inmates at Camp Sauble _ then a regular minimum-security prison _ asked her to fill in one Sunday. `` It became an addiction,'' she says. She also began teaching Bible class at the prison every Tuesday. It was at those Bible classes, which eventually grew to 40 students, that she cultivated friendships with about 20 prisoners. When they were transferred to other state prisons in early 1988 to make room for the boot camp, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> began corresponding and visiting them all over the state. `` They became like family,'' she says. `` Some of them have no visitors but me.'' Many have sent her paintings and small, prison-made artifacts. Only about five of the original 20 men remain behind bars, and many stopped corresponding upon their release, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> says. `` That does n't bother me. I had a part of their life while they were here, but they want to put their past behind them when they get out.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> does n't get any money for her prison work, but emphasizes that she does n't do it for recognition, monetary or otherwise. `` Money would never equal what I get back from these boys,'' she says.

 `` I rather specialize in old men.'' So confesses author <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>, whose fifth `` Rumpole of the Bailey'' series, starring <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McKern </PERSON>, is running on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Mystery,'' and who has a four-part play starring 86-year-old <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> running on British TV The six Rumpole episodes, each a separate story, began Dec. 7. `` Summer's Lease,'' starring <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>, will come to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the spring. <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> retired from practicing law six years ago and does n't miss it Now 66, he continues his other career as a writer. With six more Rumpole tales ready to be filmed next April, he has written more about Rumpole than any other character. `` I think my writing has got funnier,'' <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> says. `` The last three Rumpole series were written when I was n't a barrister any more. I can see the law as funnier when I'm not doing it all the time.'' Rumpole is a favorite of `` Mystery'' viewers. He calls himself an Old <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> hack. He takes cases that start fairly grungy and descend to fairly hopeless. He drinks Chateau Thames Embankment at <LOCATION> Pommeroy </LOCATION>'s Wine Bar, spouts literary quotations and witticisms, duels verbally with a wife he calls She Who Must Be Obeyed, and thinks. Everybody from the head of his law chambers to the clerk takes a dim view of Rumpole's chances in court. Though he usually makes a brilliant deduction that wins the day, <PERSON> Rumpole </PERSON> is perceived as muddling through. Rumpole is real to <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> but not necessarily the most real of his creations. `` The man in ` Summer's Lease,' Dodds, the old father, does have a life of his own. He comes bopping in and does his stuff. It's what good characters do,'' <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> says `` He's played by <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> in the TV version of it. It's going to come to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in April or May on ` Masterpiece Theater.' Its four episodes are a huge success in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` Dodds had to be played by a great big star. <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> immediately wanted to do it. He's bright as a bee. He has had the most marvelous notices with this part.'' In the Rumpole stories, <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> says, `` There are always three plots: the plot of the case, which is the least important one; his life at home; and his life in chambers. I've always found if you do an hour's TV, what makes it rich is having a lot of stories going on at the same time. And it's more interesting to do. `` Usually I write the TV scripts first. They do n't come out for nine months. During that time I write the book, so that the book can come out at the time of the TV show.'' The paperback `` Rumpole and the Age of Miracles'' contains <PERSON> Rumpole </PERSON>'s adventures in the present series. `` I do take a lot of trouble not to make the stories look as if they were novelizations of scripts,'' <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> says. `` I do n't just put ` he said' and ` she said' into it. I try to write it as though it's a work of prose fiction to begin with.'' <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> wrote `` Charade,'' his first novel, in 1946, putting in his experiences in a World War II film unit. `` I wrote six novels. ` The Narrowing Stream' was about 1954. Then I wrote ` Dock Brief,' which was a radio play. `` I gave up writing novels partly because I got into the theater and partly because I was married to a novelist, <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>, who wrote ` The Pumpkin Eater.' It did n't seem to be right to have two novelists in the family. I'm not married to her anymore.'' Three of those early novels have recently been reprinted. <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>'s `` Paradise Postponed'' was seen on TV in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1986. It's the result of his being asked to write a 13-part TV series about <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> since World War II. `` I thought I'd write the novel at the same time,'' he says. `` I was writing like it was a lot of TV scripts. I had to start again. I had n't written a novel in 30 years. In novels you have to write scenes.'' <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> has just finished a sequel called `` Titmuss Regained,'' which will be published as a book next spring. `` It's about the concreting over of the south of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, building a new town and destroying the countryside,'' he says. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s politics bemuses <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>. He says Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s great achievement is `` to have taken the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> away from the upper class and given it to the up-and-thrusting lower middle class. It's much more ruthless than the old upper-class conservatism. Old country gents were quite keen on looking after the people on the estate, bringing them blankets and boxes of tea. The new type of conservatism is just everybody for themselves.''

 <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> had doubts about acting in `` The Merchant of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>'' until she learned that her co-star was <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. `` When I knew who was playing Shylock, I became rather keen to do it, unsurprisingly,'' says the 39-year-old English actress, fresh from a sellout <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> run as <LOCATION> Portia </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s Jewish moneylender in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s dark comedy of caskets, the law and revenge. The production, directed by Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, marked <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s British and Shakespearean stage debut and packed <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> Theater for 18 weeks The play is now on view at Broadway's 46th St. Theater for a limited engagement through Feb. 24. It gives Americans the opportunity to see a two-time Oscar-winner tackle <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> in a performance which, <PERSON> James </PERSON> says, changed nightly in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` To do the trial scene, I used to walk on every day not knowing what was going to happen,'' she says, referring to <PERSON> Portia </PERSON>'s fourth-act encounter with Shylock, the beleaguered and vengeful moneylender who meets his match in the heiress, <LOCATION> Portia </LOCATION> `` When <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> was truthful, even if he took choices that were wrong, he was always brilliant _ so riveting and unexpected,'' she says. `` I felt very protective of him ... The whole company as a company was so proud to be working with him. He was so generous, spiritually and literally. He would n't have his name over the title, and insisted on me having the last curtain call.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> used a six-week break before <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> rehearsals to regather her artistic strength. `` We do n't ask opera singers to do <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> eight times a week, and honestly, I am exhausted,'' she says. `` <LOCATION> Portia </LOCATION> is a very big, quite tiring part.'' The blonde, big-boned actress is best-known to American audiences for her portrayal of <LOCATION> Mirabehn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mahatma </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s acolyte in the Oscar-winning movie about the Indian leader's life, and as <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Layton </PERSON>, the India-born daughter of a British colonel, in the 1984 TV miniseries `` The Jewel in the Crown.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON>' first experience in `` Merchant'' came while playing <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, Shylock's daughter, in a provincial production 10 years ago in the English midlands city of Coventry. Then, she recalls, <PERSON> Portia </PERSON> struck her as `` a bit of a know-all.'' Now, she finds her `` a miraculous character,'' and attributes her shift in perceptions to <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s direction. `` With <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, he is the master, he can tell you how to do it,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> says. `` If I was going to see <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> for the first time, I would choose a Peter Hall production. He may not go for innovation, but he does the play.'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> says he admired <PERSON> James </PERSON>'s `` natural musicality and sense of rhythm ... She ` sa very intelligent, feisty actress <PERSON> James </PERSON> says the director encouraged her to explore the contradictions of a character who can seem dismissive and even racist one minute, ripe with `` the quality of mercy'' _ in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s celebrated phrase _ the next. `` It's tempting to iron those contradictions out so that characters become one-dimensional in order to become recognizable,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> says. `` As actors we always want to be liked; it's much braver to dare to be disliked.'' She says <PERSON> Portia </PERSON>'s complexities `` are part of her interest.'' `` People say, ` How can someone be as nice and as nasty as <PERSON> Portia </PERSON>?' But we're very often like that,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> says. `` It's much too simple to say <PERSON> Portia </PERSON>'s any one thing, because she's all of them. `` It's important to win an audience around through convincing them of the truth of the character.'' `` Merchant'' reunited <PERSON> James </PERSON> with <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, who directed her as <PERSON> Imogen </PERSON> in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` Cymbeline'' last year at the National Theater. She replaced <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> just three weeks before the first preview of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s sprawling, rarely performed late romance. `` It was wonderful doing ` Cymbeline' knowing people did n't know it at all,'' she says. `` Those who came discovered the play.'' She also starred in <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s first film in 15 years, `` She's Been Away,'' as the self-destructive banker's wife. She and co-star <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> shared the best actress prize at the <ORGANIZATION> Venice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> in September. `` I had worked with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>; <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> had worked with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>; I had worked with <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> says. `` A lot of things about it made sense.'' She and the legendary <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, now 81, co-starred in `` The Jewel in the Crown,'' about the end of British rule in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. And the afterglow lingers on: `` I get letters still from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They have ` Jewel in the Crown' evenings, watching it on video, eating curries and wearing saris.'' Her training, typical of many English performers, was in the theater. She studied at the <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and did a stint as a dresser with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which was then presenting <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> in <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Albee </PERSON>'s `` A Delicate Balance.'' Years in regional repertory theaters led to the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> `` fringe'' and on to the commercial <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>, where she starred opposite <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> in `` When I Was a Girl, I Used To Scream and Shout.'' Her first major screen part was in `` Gandhi.'' Earlier this year, she appeared with <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldblum </PERSON> in a new film comedy, `` The Tall Guy.'' Neither that film nor `` She's Been Away'' has yet been released in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> will be seen later this year on-screen in `` The Wolves of <LOCATION> Willoughby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>,'' starring <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> from `` The Colbys'' and `` Dynasty.'' Next year, she and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>, her `` Gandhi'' co-star, re-team for a two-character play, <PERSON> Lanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s `` A Betrothal,'' which they first performed above a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> pub three years ago. <PERSON> James </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Berkshire </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one of three children and the daughter of a cardiologist. The product of `` a typical middle-class family,'' she says she became an actress more or less against the wishes of her parents. `` But if the spirits want you to be something, you be it,'' she says.

<HEAD>At the Movies: `She-Devil'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 `` She-Devil'' is a revenge movie without Sly, <PERSON> Clint </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON>. This time it's <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> who shows those vengeful gents the kind of hell that a scorned woman can administer. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> is the dull, slovenly, accident-prone wife of <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Begley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an ambitious <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> accountant with amazing tolerance for her many failings. They include running their suburban home like a city slum and mismanaging their two overbearing children. When the couple attends a gallery opening in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, he falls into the clutches of a man-hungry, self-adoring writer of romance novels, <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>. Weary of her live-in gigolo, she decides to give the accountant her business and her love. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> slowly realizes her husband has been led astray. She boils with Mephistophelean wrath, vowing to rob him of everything he holds dear: his family life, his career, his new love, his freedom. Her methods are as far-fetched as they are hilarious. Full-out farce such as `` She-Devil'' requires a feathery directorial touch and the most delicate of playing. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidelman </PERSON>'s direction is on target most of the way, maintaining a whirlwind pace that forestalls suspension of belief. The script by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strugatz </PERSON> is cleverly constructed, though some of the comedy is misdirected -LRB- example: the spoofing of senility in a retirement sanitarium -RRB-. The movie is based on the novel, `` The Life and Loves of a She-Devil,'' by <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>. Set in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the novel was made into a critically acclaimed TV miniseries telecast by PBS. The big news in `` She-Devil'' is <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>'s emergence as a world-class comedy actress. She attacks the role of the vain, foolish novelist with a skilled gusto that invites comparison to the great <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>. Streep is delicious in her cunning calculation and convulsively funny when her champagne world loses its fizz. Another revelation is <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Begley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, heretofore known for expert character roles in films -LRB- `` The Accidental Tourist'' and `` Scenes From the Class Struggle in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>'' -RRB- and as the self-centered doctor of television's `` St. Elsewhere.'' Tall and clunky with unruly straw-colored hair, he is the ideal foil for the marvelous Streep. `` She-Devil'' marks <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>'s film debut following her rapid rise as a standup comedian and television star. It would be nice to report that she scores another triumph. Alas, she seems uneasy and tentative in her role as the vindictive wife, as if wondering where the jokes are. With more expert handling, she can undoubtedly register on the big screen. Next time, <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON>. The Orion release is rated PG-13, for mild swearing and suggestive situations. Running time: 99 minutes.

 `` How I Got Into College'' -LRB- CBS-Fox Video. VHS-Beta, $ 89.98. Rated PG-13. -RRB- <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a rather dim high school student who bombs out on his SATs, nevertheless sets his sights on getting into selective <ORGANIZATION> Ramsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> to be near the girl he loves from afar, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Kailo </PERSON> _ scholar, cheerleader and class president.

Will he win the girl of his dreams? <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> -RRB- get into <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>? A high school guidance counselor might call `` How I Got Into College'' an underachiever. Consider the potential for a movie about getting into college _ the terror of taking the SATs, confusion over where to apply, the dreaded college interview, the agonizing wait for word of whether you've been admitted or rejected. `` How I Got Into College,'' a comedy, tries to take on all this, but does it with little humor, drama or insight. It has some clever spots _ a shady SAT coaching service; a mailman bringing a letter with a demonic grin; students phoning home frantically to find out whether they've received a fat letter -LRB- an acceptance -RRB- or a thin one -LRB- a rejection -RRB-. But the movie often substitutes offbeat camera angles for humor, and the odd-couple romance is n't particularly compelling. By the end, it's clear <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> has more to offer than we thought. But not much more. Send `` How I Got Into College'' a thin letter. _ By <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Badge of the Assassin'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Vidmark </ORGANIZATION>. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95. Rated R. -RRB- Why would anyone want to spend $ 90 for a made-for-television movie that has had its share of reruns since 1985? Video companies seem to think consumers are either dumb or so hungry for movies they'll buy anything. `` Badge of the Assassin'' is actually a fairly good cop and court room drama about the conviction of <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members who murdered two police officers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the early 1970s. It stars <PERSON> Yaphet </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotto </PERSON> as the investigating detective who must walk a thin line, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> as the young and crusading assistant district attorney who prosecutes the black radicals. But despite excellent acting, the pacing is slow and the overall feel of the movie is television tepid. The hard edge that could and should be there is missing. `` Under the Biltmore Clock,'' from <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> for $ 79.98, is another leftover from television. This time it's the jazz age as seen through <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. You can miss it. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` Deaf, Dumb, and Blonde'' -LRB- Sire -RRB- _ <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaf </PERSON>, Dumb and Blonde'' is <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s third solo effort since the breakup of the punk bastion <PERSON> Blondie </PERSON>. Unfortunately, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> has locked into today's pop format and the album lacks her snarling early 1980s cleverness. Two of the tracks, including the lead single, `` I Want That Man,'' were written by <PERSON> Allanah </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Thompson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twins </ORGANIZATION>, and their influence permeates most of the record in the form of snappy beats and almost mundane lyrics. On the few songs <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> wrote with ex-boyfriend <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, the dark, brooding punk attitudes return. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s self-confident lyrics and <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>'s menacing guitar combine on several notable tracks. `` Lovelight,'' a duet with <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Astbury </PERSON> of The Cult, mixes paradoxical imagery with Indian rhythms to tell of love in a cryptic, mystical setting. `` Calmarie,'' which <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> sings partly in Spanish, is a lovely showcase for the higher register of her voice. `` Brite Side'' produces a more tender side. She is confident, but not arrogant; loving, but not worshiping. You have to wait for most of the record for a real knockout. That comes with the last track, the gorgeously arranged `` End of the Run.'' It is a partly spoken song-poem that tells of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s beginnings: `` when a torn T-shirt made it all dangerous. In it, she says she `` does n't like flashbacks in movies ... I like the story to proceed.'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s story has proceeded, but into what's threatening to look like pop dribble. She's called her new music `` simpler and more aggressive.'' Simpler, yes. More agressive, no. By <PERSON> Kira </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billik </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Chase Takes Charge of His Career</HEAD>

 After a dozen years in movies, <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> can still take a tumble to get a laugh, but he is learning not to risk career falls because of bad advice. The lesson has n't come easily for the tall, preppie-looking comedian. After creating a falling-down sensation on `` Saturday Night Live,'' he made an impressive film debut in `` Foul Play'' and followed with big-money hits such as `` Caddyshack,'' `` National Lampoon's Vacation'' and `` Fletch.'' But along the way he encountered films that might have submerged a less durable performer: `` Under the Rainbow,'' `` Oh! Heavenly Dog,'' `` Modern Problems,'' `` The Deal of the Century.'' Despite such disasters, Chase has survived and reportedly draws $ 5 million per movie. His latest is `` National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,'' which reunites him with `` Vacation'' buddies <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Angelo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON>. Chase has finally reached a point where he decided he had to take charge of his own career. `` I do n't think there's a star around who does n't feel that way,'' he reflected. `` The problem with that is that it can become too egotistical, too warped by your own lack of introspection and perspective. `` The world is different -LRB- when you're a star -RRB-. It behaves differently towards you. You're no longer just like anybody else around you. You have to remember there's such a thing as compromise and collaboration. On top of that, of all the arts that I'm familiar with, film is the most collaborative `` I was reading an article about <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedkin </PERSON> -LRB- ` The Exorcist' -RRB- the other day. He said, ` I do n't consider myself any more or less important than a crew member.' We all know that's not true of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>. We know that he would like to think that and that he means it. The fact is that his ego takes over, and he gets crazy. He's also a brilliant director.'' <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> cited last year's `` Fletch Lives'' as evidence of why he needs to make his own decisions. `` Quite frankly, I had a lot of trepidation about the ` Fletch' sequel It was in the middle of the writers' strike. I was the only one who kept saying, ` No, it's not gon na work, it's not happening.' ... Everybody at Universal: ` It's going to be great, do n't worry.' Me: ` No, it's not working. `` I hate that. And yet I go along with it. It ends up with me putting on a lot of funny faces and trying to mug my way through a picture. It worked for what it was. But I did n't think it was a good picture. Then I have to go out on a junket and promote it, the whole time feeling bad about it.'' Chase does n't feel that way about `` Christmas Vacation.'' `` I think it can stand on its own as a picture,'' he said. `` It's got a lot of the richness of the first ` Vacation,' if you can call that stuff rich. It's written by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, as the first one was. ... It's directed by a very talented young director named <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Chechik </PERSON>, who's got a great eye and a lot of warmth. `` And it's very physical, more physical in the <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> tradition than I've ever done before. I love that stuff.'' <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said he participated in all the production decisions, from the first meeting with executives from <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> until the final print. If he is so gung-ho on control, why does n't he direct his own films, like <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>? `` Clint's children are grown up; <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> does n't have any,'' he pointed out. `` I'm not prepared to take myself away from my family for the amount of time -LRB- needed to direct a film -RRB-. I try to be as much a part of the directing process as I can, without being away from my family. `` It's hard enough to be the star and see your family during that three-month production period. If you direct a movie, you're looking at a year This is a very important, precious period in my kids' lives,'' he said. Chase has three children. `` They are from one to six years old, and a five-year-old. They need the accessibility of their dad, as well as their mom. The fact is, I need it, too.'' His resolve may stem from his own childhood: `` I came from a divorced family, and that was very tough. I think it has affected me all my life. I think it affects anyone whose parents are divorced. I do n't like it, I do n't like to see it happen. It's hard on the kids.'' He was born into a wealthy <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> family on Oct. 8, 1943, and named <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> -LRB- his grandmother provided the <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION>, perhaps after the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb -RRB-. An expensive education provided a bachelor of arts degree in English and a determination to perform. After writing for Mad magazine and the <ORGANIZATION> Smothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, he fell in with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lampoon </ORGANIZATION> people and ended up in the first cast of `` Saturday Night Live.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Through the Lens of Eudora Welty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 During the Great Depression, <PERSON> Eudora </PERSON> <PERSON> Welty </PERSON> captured the many guises of poverty through her camera's lens. And despite the despair, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author found a natural joy as Mississipians washed laundry by hand, tended a bootleg still or slaughtered hogs. Unlike other photographers who chronicled the era, such as <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> who intentionally illustrated the pain and bitterness of the period, <PERSON> Welty </PERSON>'s photographs are n't a misery index of any sort. The Southern writer found almost universally pleasant emotions in her unposed subjects. Her 1930s photographs _ taken as she traveled <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> as a publicity agent for President <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> _ provide solid evidence of the joy and pride she saw among even the most poverty-stricken residents of the nation's poorest state <PERSON> Welty </PERSON>, 80, says her favorite face is that of a middle-age woman standing with hands at her side in a tattered sweater. The portrait is the first to appear in both of <PERSON> Welty </PERSON>'s photography books. `` It shows such a marvelous character,'' she said. `` These were taken in the Depression when everybody had absolutely nothing. And she looked so valiant and courageous, dignified and completely self-possessed while she was so poor _ and in an old sweater full of holes.'' `` One Time, One Place,'' a book of 100 black-and-white photographs published in 1971 by <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, focused exclusively on <PERSON> Welty </PERSON>'s Depression era pictures. Her new book, `` <PERSON> Eudora </PERSON> <PERSON> Welty </PERSON> <PERSON> Photographs </PERSON>,'' recently published by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>, features 226 black-and-white images _ many included in the first book. They extend into the'50s and across the globe. However, the'30s photographs of poor Mississippians still dominate in both quantity and quality. Other photographs include architecture of the South and other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and foreign regions <PERSON> Welty </PERSON> has visited and portraits of such writers, painters, musicians and sculptors as <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, V.S. <PERSON> Pritchett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sackville-West </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Creekmore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Creeft </PERSON>. <PERSON> Welty </PERSON>, author of `` The Ponder Heart,'' `` Losing Battles'' and `` The Optimist's Daughter,'' for which she won the Pulitzer in 1972, said it was fiction that provided her with the most productive tool for dissecting every dimension of a human personality. But in her Depression-era photography, she hopes viewers concentrate on the faces of her subjects and not just the overwhelming poverty. `` I think they need to see the face in the midst of the poverty _ see the situation in reality and yet see the character, the human being,'' she said. `` Eudora Welty Photographs'' sells for $ 49.95. It includes a six-page foreward by novelist <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> and a 16-page question-and-answer interview with <PERSON> Welty </PERSON> on when, why and how she took the photographs. The interview was conducted by <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seetha </PERSON> <PERSON> Srinivasan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Welty </PERSON> insists she is n't a photographer and a review of the technical quality of her work will miss her point altogether. She calls her pictures `` snapshots,'' a kind of community `` family album.'' She used a simple <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> with bellows at first, and later a more sophisticated Rolleiflex. She tutored herself in the art of photography and never thought of publishing the `` snapshots'' at the time. She notes, for example, that many photographs inside buildings are underexposed because of her ignorance about light. Her picture-taking diminished after she lost the Rolleiflex on the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> sabway in 1951. `` They keep fussing at me at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> when I say I'm an amateur, but I am,'' she said `` I was interested in my subjects, not my expertise.'' There are considerably more black people in the book than had been shown in other collections and more than one would expect from white photographers traveling the South. <PERSON> Welty </PERSON> says that is something that could n't be duplicated today, because in the 1930s there was `` more trust'' between blacks and whites _ and the trust `` dates'' the photographs more than anything else. It was easy then for a moderately affluent white person to talk with an impoverished black stranger and ask to take his picture. Today, suspicion and overtones of exploitation would prevent such encounters, she said. `` I did n't ever approach anybody and say ` Stand still, I want to take your picture.' It was all done on a human basis, with common courtesy,'' <PERSON> Welty </PERSON> said. `` What I would usually say was ` Do you mind if I take your picture doing just what you're doing now.' ... I did n't pose anyone. I did n't say stand here and do this. That's why I think the pictures are so good. They are just doing what they're doing.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Canadian Band Makes Movie Debut</HEAD>

 Canadian rockers Blue Rodeo are used to stealing shows on their own, but in their recent movie debut they played backup band to country and western singer Meryl Streep. Meryl Streep? That's right. And, according to <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION> vocalist <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Keelor </PERSON>, the band has the Academy Award-winning actress' chauffeur to thank for the gig. Platinum-selling artists in their native <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the five members of Blue Rodeo hope their cameo with Streep in next year's release of `` Postcards From the Edge'' and their new album, `` Diamond Mine,'' will propel them to similar status in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` She's very good,'' group member <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuddy </PERSON> said of Streep's performance on `` Checking Out of the Heartbreak Hotel. `` She can sing very well. She's probably kind of a boundless entertainer.'' Filmmaker <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> wanted a group that sounded like an early version of The Band. Blue Rodeo, who performed with former Band members <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> on the Canadian Juno Awards show earlier this year, was one of five bands asked to submit tapes. Streep was listening to the tapes while being driven into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when her chauffeur raved about Blue Rodeo's 1987 debut, `` Outskirts,'' <PERSON> Keelor </PERSON> said. Soon after, <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION> auditioned and won the movie role. `` It was a very normal kind of experience,'' said <PERSON> Cuddy </PERSON>, whose band rehearsed <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> songs with Streep before shooting the scene. `` I'm sure that's not the typical Hollywood experience. This was one of the first times we've stayed in separate rooms.'' Blue Rodeo traces its roots to the late 1970s, when <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> natives <PERSON> Keelor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cuddy </PERSON> rather violently crossed paths for the first time. <PERSON> Cuddy </PERSON> was a football linebacker who slammed quarterback <PERSON> Keelor </PERSON> to the ground in a scrimmage. Nevertheless, they soon became friends and began writing songs together. Keelor and <PERSON> Cuddy </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the early'80s looking to succeed with Fly to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a rock band they admit now was unfocused. Fly to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> shared rehearsal space with <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> friends who formed the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junkies </ORGANIZATION>. Trying to make it in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> proved unsatisfying, typified by the disappointment the pair heard from musicians who responded to their newspaper ad and found they would n't be flown to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for auditions, <PERSON> Cuddy </PERSON> said. They moved back to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> in 1984 and ditched Fly to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. They formed Blue Rodeo, adding acoustic guitars to their collection and aiming for a country-rock hybrid inspired by the <ORGANIZATION> Everly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and the Beatles. `` It was the music to do,'' said the 33-year-old <PERSON> Cuddy </PERSON>. `` It gives an artist a certain longevity, a certain respectability that is not always evident in pop music. To just chase pop music and chase an audience that's half your age is a little ridiculous... It's especially embarrassing if you get rejected by 11-year-olds.'' Despite a twang in their sound, Blue Rodeo does n't feel comfortable in the world of country music. And, frankly, country music probably would n't feel comfortable with a band whose keyboard player occasionally solos by standing barefoot on his organ. `` I like the harmonies and I like the mournfulness of it,'' <PERSON> Cuddy </PERSON> said of country music. `` I've always liked the details in the lyrics, the focus on small details, but I've never wanted to be a full-fledged member of country music. It's just not something that appeals to me. I think we're rock musicians borrowing from country.'' Like a certain famed British songwriting duo they admired, <PERSON> Cuddy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keelor </PERSON>'s styles are often a contrast between the sinister and the sweet. <PERSON> Cuddy </PERSON>'s smooth voice highlights country ballads like `` Try,'' which won a Juno Award for Canadian song of the year in 1988, and new songs `` Now and Forever'' and `` House of Dreams.'' <PERSON> Keelor </PERSON>'s vocal phrasing is a dead ringer for early <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> on `` The Ballad of the Dime Store Greaser and the Blonde <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'' and, with keyboard player <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, he creates an eerie, Doors-like sound on the new album's title cut. The contrast can be jarring on record but makes more sense onstage when the pair harmonize, said <PERSON> Keelor </PERSON>, 35. `` It's certainly an advantage in that you can cover a lot of ground in songwriting,'' <PERSON> Cuddy </PERSON> said. `` We can approach things from a couple of different ways. And just from a physical standpoint, it's nice not to have to sing all night.'' Blue Rodeo's sound, for lack of a more appropriate word, has been described as quintessentially American. They're not afraid to sing about their southern neighbors; `` God and Country'' is about <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. `` There's also a sort of Canadian tradition in the band, like <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, of writing a lot about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Keelor </PERSON> said. `` But it's with a different perspective, it's like with a distance. `` The modern world has a fascination with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But for us, it's even more tangible. We speak the language. We can cross the borders and work down here as legal aliens. I did that for years.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION>'s own success points out differences between the two countries. In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, `` Outskirts'' was the country's equivalent of a double-platinum album -LRB- more than 200,000 sold -RRB- and the band plays in concert halls. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they're critical favorites but are largely unknown. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a double-platinum LP would mean that more than 2 million copies were sold. At a recent Blue Rodeo performance in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, dozens of Canadians packed the Lone Star Roadhouse. A cardboard cutout of a Canadian Mountie hung over the stage. Such questions as `` what province are you from?'' replaced typical <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> small talk. `` The success we have in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is pretty good for us,'' <PERSON> Keelor </PERSON> said. `` We'd like to do the same thing here. A large part of it is just to keep playing and have people see us. We're fairly confident that when people see us, they'll like it. It's a good show.''

 <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishiguro </PERSON> set his first novel in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, but changed his mind and moved much of its action to <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>. His second novel, a critic wrote, should be read by anyone wanting to understand the Japanese. With his third novel, `` The Remains of the Day,'' the 35-year-old novelist has turned his eye on his adopted country with an imaginative tour de force built around that most British of institutions, the butler. Like Jeeves, that other famous butler of fiction, Mr. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Darlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> is a proud perfectionist. But there any resemblance ends. This is no P.J. <PERSON> Wodehouse </PERSON> farce but a somber, disturbing tale that has harvested ecstatic reviews plus this year's Booker Prize, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most prestigious literary award. <PERSON> Ishiguro </PERSON>'s achievement is all the greater for the fact that he writes of a <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> he has not seen since he was 5 and of an <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> that died a generation before him. At 35, this Nagasaki-born scion of samurai lineage is a thoroughly modern Englishman, right down to the soft south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> accent. He writes in English, and says his Japanese is too poor for conversation with other Japanese. But he keeps a photo of himself as a 10-month-old baby pictured beside the family samurai swords, and his prose has the subtlety and understatement one associates with a Japanese watercolor. He can vaguely remember grown-ups mentioning genshibakudan, the atomic bomb, but only now is he paying a visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, his first since his oceanographer father brought the family to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1954 and settled in <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION>, a comfortably middle-class town southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. At school, <PERSON> Ishiguro </PERSON> recalls, `` I learned to use my conspicuousness to make myself very popular. They did n't know whether I should be hero-worshiped or stigmatized.'' He ended up `` kind of mascotized.'' He backpacked through <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and did odd jobs, including a season as a fieldhand on royal grouse hunts. He wanted to be a rock musician, but ended up at novelist <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradbury </PERSON>'s creative writing department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglia </ORGANIZATION> He published some short stories, then a novel, `` A Pale View of Hills.'' In 1986 came his dazzling second novel, `` An Artist of the Floating World,'' set in 1950s <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` We are seeing here the emergence of one of the masters of contemporary English writing. And if you want to start to understand the Japanese, begin here,'' wrote <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The novel told of a respected painter coming to terms with his less-than-glorious World War II years as a propaganda artist for Japanese militarists. `` The Remains of the Day'' is also about old men's regrets _ in this case the butler's recognition that <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Darlington </PERSON>, the gentleman he served with utter devotion, was a well-meaning but wholly misguided sympathizer with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and a pawn in the hands of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribbentrop </PERSON>. The story begins in 1956. <ORGANIZATION> Darlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> has passed with its butler to an American owner, Mr. <PERSON> Farraday </PERSON>, who kindly lends <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> his car and sends him off on a motoring holiday through western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. As he drives, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> reflects on his life as a butler in the 1930s, and gradually his shell of professional reserve peels away to reveal truth after shattering truth: Here is a man so duteous that he kept serving drinks even though aware that his father was dying upstairs; who was deeply loved by the housekeeper but never realized it, and anyway, believed marriage among servants disrupted household duties; who without demur fired two Jewish maids because his lordship thought it was a good idea; who was deluded enough to believe he was contributing to world peace by serving the correct wines to the British and German guests who would gather at <LOCATION> Darlington </LOCATION> Hall to plot the appeasement of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' shame is not that he was pro- or anti-Nazi, but that he never had an opinion either way, so blinded was he by duty. `` You see, I trusted,'' he tells a stranger when he finally faces up to the truth. `` I trusted in his lordship's wisdom. All those years I served him, I trusted I was doing something worthwhile.'' Thus <PERSON> Ishiguro </PERSON> neatly reverses the cliche of `` what the butler saw'' by building a novel around what the butler did n't see, and poses a crucial question for democracies everywhere: How are ordinary citizens to make up their own minds, when `` a group of people can shout for a long time, ` we know what we're doing, just trust us,' and most of us in this country are in a helpless position. We just do n't know enough to argue back.'' Another achievement of `` The Remains of the Day'' is that in telling his story entirely in <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>'s voice, <PERSON> Ishiguro </PERSON> displays a near-flawless ear for butler language. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is fussy, buttoned-up, comical, even exasperating. He reflects on the English countryside's calm beauty -LRB- so different to the `` unseemly demonstrativeness'' of American and African landscapes -RRB-; on the essence of butlering -LRB- `` Not -LRB- to -RRB- be shaken out by external events, however surprising'' -RRB-; or the importance of properly polishing the silver -LRB- `` the state of the silver had made a small, but significant contribution towards the easing of relations between <LOCATION> Lord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Herr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribbentrop </PERSON> that evening.'' -RRB- He has trouble with his American master's little jokes and teasings, and takes to studying a humorous radio program for tips, `` because the witticisms performed on it are always in the best of taste and, to my mind, of a tone not at all out of keeping with the sort of bantering Mr. <PERSON> Farraday </PERSON> might expect on my part.'' Japanese and English societies share rigid structures that invite comparison, but <PERSON> Ishiguro </PERSON> resists the temptation. He can see much that is `` strange, bizarre and exotic'' in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, but recognizes he must seem equally strange to the Japanese, who, he suspects, are `` slightly baffled, fascinated and probably slightly threatened'' by him because `` multiculturalism is something they're not used to. But `` culturally, people are increasingly becoming a mixture of things,'' he says. `` I'm an obvious example of that.''

 It's been a year of milestones for <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, `` the father of bluegrass music.'' In October, the stately 78-year-old celebrated his 50th anniversary on the Grand Ole Opry, the live country music show he helped transform into an American institution. In February, he won a Grammy Award in a newly added category: best bluegrass recording. And he ended the decade the way he began it: chatting with the president at the White House. In 1980, he played his beloved mandolin on the White House lawn for President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. This November, he was invited to 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> to meet President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. When the celebrations and awards and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> visits subside, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> can sit at his office desk and read a sticker pasted on the wall: `` Bluegrass: finger picking good.'' This music, developed by <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> in the 1930s, has been mighty good indeed to this legendary performer. Millions have heard him on the Grand Ole Opry or in live performances. He's entertained in every state and in several foreign countries. He's sold more than 50 million records. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopted a resolution honoring him for `` many contributions to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> culture and music.'' He says he's lasted so long because he took care of himself and enjoyed singing and playing. `` I've always liked work and I've been stout,'' he said in an interview. `` I've taken care of myself and never did smoke or drink. Work is something I've always liked to do. I like to do something every day. `` I love to play music and hear it. I love to put the sounds and notes in there that I want to hear. I want to do the best I can for my friends and fans sitting out there in the audience.'' <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, a descendant of the fifth president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is best known for his songs `` Blue Moon of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>,'' `` Uncle Pen'' and `` Mule Skinner Blues.'' `` Blue Moon of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>,'' which he wrote in 1946, was recorded some 10 years later by <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>. `` I knew he was coming with another style of music,'' <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> recalled. `` One Saturday night, they had him on the Grand Ole Opry. He came around to me and apologized for singing the way he did.'' `` I told him if it gave him a good start with his music and everything, I was for him 100 percent. So our friendship stood good all the way.'' Born near <LOCATION> Rosine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> was the youngest of eight children and was orphaned by age 11. He was raised by an uncle who was an excellent fiddler and mandolinist. By age 12, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> was playing music at dances with his uncle and perfecting his tenor voice that was to enthrall millions for years to come. Down through the years, he taught bluegrass music _ the string music of guitars, banjos, fiddles and mandolins _ to disciples such as <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Flatt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON>, who played in his band, the Bluegrass Boys. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> has recorded for <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Records for nearly 40 years, a rarity in the music industry where performers often change labels every few years. `` They've been a big help to me and we work together good,'' he said. His most recent album is `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> and the Bluegrass Boys Live at the Opry.'' He still performs 100 times a year at bluegrass festivals, country music shows and the like. In his office is a lined white sheet of paper with a place on each line for the date and the city he's booked in. Even after more than 50 years on the road, he still finds travel inspirational. `` I like to see the hills and mountains and valleys and how they take care of the land and everything,'' <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> said. He's been blessed with good health and a steely determination to keep his music alive. When he was diagnosed with colon cancer in the early 1980s, he fought it with the spirit he shows as his nimble fingers dance along the neck of his mandolin. `` The doctor said I whipped the cancer out,'' <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Keeping up with the changing times of frontiers falling, European winter resorts are reaching out across borders to create sprawling international and interconnected networks of runs where you can cruise for days without skiing in the same tracks. In <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, you can board a cog railway up to traffic-free <LOCATION> Zermatt </LOCATION>, buckle up your skis before taking a long-distance lift and never remove them until lunchtime spaghetti at the Italian resort of <LOCATION> Cervinia </LOCATION>. Or you can ski through 250 miles of runs on the Franco-Italian `` Milky Way,'' starting in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s oldest resort, at <LOCATION> Sestriere </LOCATION>, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> auto conglomerate. Keep on your skis through three series of peaks and valleys and finally reach the French area of <LOCATION> Montgenevre </LOCATION>, before gliding back to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, using more than 100 different lifts. At <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chamonix </LOCATION>, the foot of <PERSON> Mont </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON>, highest summit of the Alps, you can board three cable cars over glaciers and wind your way down to <LOCATION> Courmayeur </LOCATION>, on the Italian side. Or you can pole across the French side of the famous St. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON>, and schuss down to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to a waiting minibus which will take you back to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> through a tunnel under the mountain. Crossing borders _ sometimes even without a passport _ has become a routine way of life for skiing Europeans, whose middle class has made the winter vacation and the `` snow weekend'' a normal occurrence. Parents think nothing of suiting up their children with designer clothes, and new skis for more than $ 1,000 so they can enjoy a week with their classmates at the mountain. Most city dwellers _ even hundreds of miles away from a nearby mountain _ avidly tune in to the snow reports and take a few days off from work as fast as the ski rack can be fastened atop their car. For those who are bored with the lift lines up and the whizzing down for the next queue, resorts are dreaming up a few new wrinkles imported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Freestyle skiing, monoski and snowboard are big in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, with special instruction classes. Daring mountaineers offer deltaplaning in every Alpine resort, while even sleddogging is taught by a veteran of the famous <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> race in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Pontedilegno-Tonale. Costume parties _ even outside the Carnival period _ or torchlit descents in the starlit nights with instructors take place weekly throughout <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Finally, cross-country skiing has caught on not just for the over-60s, but for young children, encouraged by low equipment rental fees. Most Europeans however, dream of the great runs of the big-name resorts: <LOCATION> Cortina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> d'Ampezzo </LOCATION>, site of the 1956 Winter Olympics, snuggles deep in the Italian Dolomites, offering an array of 11 valleys and 660 miles of tracks, with a large part kept skiable by artifical snow machines. <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Isere </PERSON> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Tignes </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Super </PERSON> <PERSON> Tignes </PERSON>, now bristles with high-rises and hi-tech lifts allowing glacier skiing late into the spring. Nearby <LOCATION> Albertville </LOCATION> will host the 1992 Winter Olympics, which former world champion <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Killy </PERSON> has been promoting around the world. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, celebrating its 700th anniversary as a confederation in 1991, appeals to the posh set with <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moritz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Crans-Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Verbier </LOCATION>, only a couple of hours from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> airport And Austrians beckon from the start of November thanks to snow machines in their <LOCATION> Tyrol </LOCATION> resorts of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kitsbuhel </LOCATION>, which hosts World Cup downhill and slalom races for both men and women next January. But skiers should look east and south for the best bargains and the most challenging runs. Runaway currency devaluation and a strong tourist industry has made <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, for example, one of the most economical destinations. Last year, while many European resorts wept over lack of snow due to a freak warm winter, spanking new <ORGANIZATION> Kopaonik </ORGANIZATION>, in central <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, frolicked in snow banks and 26 miles of broad pistes. Further north, in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, just over the Italian border, <LOCATION> Kranjska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gora </LOCATION>, site of many World Cup races, also began attracting cost-conscious mountaineers. One of the greatest draws is the power of hard currency which can buy top-of-the line skis for less than $ 150 and beautifully hand-knit sweaters for less than $ 50. Let alone hotel rooms for less than $ 40 a night. The other new bargain areas are found mainly above the plains in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baqueira </PERSON> <PERSON> Beret </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION> in the Spanish Pyrenees, is a favorite of sportsman King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> and his family and for skiers who like to pile in the paella rice, Sangria wine and late night flamenco high in the Pyrenees. Nestled in the snowy peaks between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the tiny republic of <LOCATION> Andorra </LOCATION> offers half a dozen sites where the snow is still virgin and where the valleys echo with Catalonian songs of its hardy shepherds. <LOCATION> Andorra </LOCATION>'s duty-free status also allows for some of the best ski equipment and clothes bargains in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decade ago, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> completed a first-rate international airport which it confidently believed would serve as the gateway for a great influx of visitors. The tourist boom it expected has not taken place, largely because the airport is a long way out of town, and many prospective visitors are turned away by chilling tales of the high cost of everything. Enroute to other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> cities, they opt to stay over in one of the airport hotels and resume their journeys the next day. If they are out for adventure and excitement, they have made the wrong decision, for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> is one of the liveliest, most vibrant and culturally rich cities on earth. `` Ca vaut le detour,'' as the French say. `` It is worth going out of one's way to see.'' The city is immense. Twelve million people. But to the visitor strolling around its 23 wards it seems more like a string of self-contained villages, each with its own markets, department stores, cinemas, theaters, bathhouses and places of entertainment. It is a city in a hurry, yet its business gets done each day smoothly, efficiently, politely. The streets are clean, and it is one of the safest cities anywhere. The city may be expensive _ actually it is not much more so than <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> _ but the human spectacle and much else is free. Trains, buses, subways and taxis get you to your destination quickly and with little fuss. And, mercifully, English signs pointing the way proliferate. What astonishes the first-time visitor is the discovery that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, while giving ample evidence of its oriental roots, also is a great center of Western culture. Kabuki and <PERSON> Noh </PERSON>, the classical theater, dazzle the newcomer along with bunraku, the centuries-old art of the puppet. Thanks to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s prosperity, they flourish as never before. But their appeal to Japanese is miniscule compared to the powerful attraction of Western music _ both popular and classical _ dance and opera. No city has so many symphony orchestras, ballet companies or fulltime opera troupes. There are five or six of each playing to full houses most of the time. Yet this hardly slakes the cultural thirst. To accomodate it, Japanese impresarios spend millions each year to bring the best they can offer to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. And the prices are indeed daunting. The equivalent of three hundred dollars for a ticket is not unusual. Despite this, most performances are sold out months in advance. Devotees of jazz, rock, punk, heavy metal, country and western and just plain pop music pay less to hear their heroes and heroines because there are more of them. The home-grown product, with the exception of popular singing, is inferior, but the ravenous <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> appetite for the loudest, funkiest and best the West can offer is regularly satisfied by famous bands and singers. Art lovers can walk their feet off in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s more than fifty galleries and museums, many of which contain masterpieces of Asian, American and European painting and sculpture. There is something for nearly every taste, from <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON> to <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>. If there were any doubts about <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s standing in the world of culture, they were dispelled when the great <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> museum, the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>, twice consented to part temporarily with two of its treasures, <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON>'s enigmatic <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, and the celebrated Greek sculpture, the <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Milo </PERSON>. Displayed in the National Museum, they were seen by admiring millions. And when the widely admired <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> painter, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON>, decided to hold his first exhibition abroad, it took place in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Some of the galleries occupy space in big department stores. The first posthumous exhibition of the erotic art of the Spanish master, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, took place in a department store, reached through the kimono and lingerie displays. Because they get no tax breaks, big corporations do not contribute to art and culture on the American scale. But several of them own and run galleries of their own. One of these is the <ORGANIZATION> Idemitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> company, which has one of the best collections of Chinese porcelain in existence. Another, the <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, boasts a handful of Rembrandts as well as other Western masters. The Museum of Western Art, in the Ueno cultural complex, houses the important <PERSON> Matsukata </PERSON> collection of French impressionist art. It also contains the second best collection of <LOCATION> Rodin </LOCATION> sculptures anywhere. A half dozen of the most celebrated of the Matsukata paintings remain in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, confiscated by the French government at the beginning of World War II as enemy property and not since returned. Prestige was the reason a big <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> insurance company forked out forty million dollars to buy <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Sunflowers'' recently. It reasoned that it not only was a masterpiece but a gilt-edged investment. It hangs in a special room of the company's headquarters where thousands of Japanese have admired it Prestige also was the motive of the owner of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Otani </LOCATION> hotel in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in persuading the celebrated <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> restaurant, the Tour d'Argent, to open its only branch overseas on its first floor. Perhaps the most expensive restaurant in the world, the Tour d'Argent is one of several hundred <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> restaurants which, along with those of other countries, make eating out in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> high adventure. They are managed either by French chefs or Japanese trained in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. So next time you go through <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, throw caution and checkbook to the winds. What could be more exciting than an afternoon visit to a museum, a concert or ballet in the evening, the kabuki next day, then superb French, Chinese or Japanese cuisine to top it off? After all, you only live once.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> is inviting one and all to take a step into its rollicking, rowdy past during the state's year-long centennial celebration in 1990. Settled by rugged mountain men who revered the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>' beaver pelts as highly as gold and later by cowboys tending cattle herds that once made <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> the richest town per capita in the world, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s heritage is woven of the stuff that made the West wild Justice once was dispensed with a short rope and a long drop, and outlaws like <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, the Sundance Kid and the rest of `` the Wild Bunch'' often high-tailed it to the `` Hole in the Wall'' west of <LOCATION> Kaycee </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> to avoid the gallows between bank heists and train holdups. The outlaws, the range wars between cattlemen and sheep ranchers, and the lonely lives of cowboys riding the desolate plains in search of strays all combined to give <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> an image as a wild place for the rough-and-ready. During 1990 travelers will be able to sample this life, be it by viewing the state's open expanses from atop a Conestoga wagon, by taking in the world's largest rodeo at the 94th annual <ORGANIZATION> Cheyenne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> Days in late July, or by walking through the barracks at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>, where the cavalry once protected emigrants passing along the Overland Trail. `` There will be plenty of western-oriented activities for people to participate in,'' says <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, community service consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. And the activities will be found in just about every corner of the state as communities from <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, Spotted Horse to <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Mule </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junction </ORGANIZATION> to Moose celebrate the centennial. While the state that boasts of being `` What America Once Was'' wo n't actually turn 100 until July 10, the partying begins on Jan. 1 and runs through the end of the year. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s centennial party this year gained nationwide attention with a massive, and dusty, cattle drive reminiscent of those run from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> in the late 1800s, but in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> there's really no single eye-grabbing, headline-catching event. Instead the <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is urging the state's communities to mark the birthday in ways fitting to their particular heritage With that in mind, for those tourists who want to step into the past there will be wagon trains and trail rides, shootouts and rodeos, ice cream socials and elaborate balls. Those who prefer to mix the present with the past will be able to take in an international centennial celebration in <LOCATION> Worland </LOCATION> featuring Chinese ice sculptures, cheer on cyclists in the Casper Classic International Bike Race in Casper, or take in the Grand Teton Music Festival with 13,766-foot-tall Grand Teton serving as a backdrop. A look at the mountain men who wandered the state's rocky ranges in search of furs will be possible in <LOCATION> Pinedale </LOCATION> in early July, when the 54th reenactment of the 1840 mountain man rendezvous on the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is staged. The biggest individual birthday party will be held in early July in <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, the state capital tucked away in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s southeastern corner The celebration July 7-10 will include a reenactment of the arrival of the original telegram declaring <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s statehood, an ethnic festival recognizing the diverse cultures that call the state home, and a fireworks extravaganza. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said 10,000-15 ,000 people a day are expected to join the revelry in <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, which in the late 1800s was known as `` Hell on Wheels'' because of the hard-drinking, gun-toting men who passed through the frontier town <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s geography is just as diverse as the centennial celebrations. Although the eastern half of the state is mostly high, desolate plains cut here and there by long, narrow strips of mountain ranges, the western half is internationally renowned for its grandeur. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> brought <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hole </PERSON> in September to conduct ministerial meetings in the shadows of the craggy, snow-capped Tetons. Just to the north of the valley is the world's first national park, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, and its vast bison and elk herds and thousands of thermal features. `` There's plenty for people to participate in 1990,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> says. `` All they have to is contact us and we'll let them know.''

 Visitors who visit <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> during its 1990 Centennial have a unique opportunity to experience the theme that runs through the state's history like a vein of gold _ man's love affair with the land. The Gem State's 100th birthday party will feature a gamut of `` Wild West'' celebrations in virtually every town and county. And there is the added reward of traveling through eye-catching <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> became the 43rd state on July 3, 1890. Settlers traveled to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> for its resources: gold and silver, endless stands of timber, the rich volcanic soil. `` People who came here were looking for something to exploit, but not in the bad sense,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> who spent 17 years as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. One of the most involved projects in the celebration is the creation of a Centennial Park. State officials insisted that monument reflect industry's role in opening up the wild territory to civilization. Mining attracted the first major influx of settlers, so it was natural to locate the park around the old gold rush towns of <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION> and Bonanza in central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Those rustic ghost towns are a short jaunt off <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> 75, nestled in the pines along the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fork </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Ore wagons rattled along the Motorway toll road to the ranching community of <PERSON> Challis </PERSON>, where the park's interpretive center will be built. `` We had two Oregon Trail parks, but we did n't have any park for mining, which brought them here in the first place,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` The Oregon Trail people passed through <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, but did n't think they could farm here.'' Within two hour's drive from the Centennial Park are the granite crags of the <LOCATION> Sawtooth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, the champagne whitewater of the Middle and Main forks of the Salmon, or the world-class ski slopes of <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The resort retains the 1940s aura that attracted the world's elite: <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>, to name a few. The Silver Valley in the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> historically has ranked as one of the top 10 mining districts in the world. Travelers intending to put in a busy day can visit the <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wallace </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s oldest standing building in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cataldo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> built in 1853, or the lakeside resort community of <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cataldo </PERSON> was built by Jesuit priests and local Indians using wooden pegs instead of nails. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s longest gondola will soon stretch from the town of <LOCATION> Kellogg </LOCATION> to the Silverhorn ski area in the <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> remains a thick carpet of timber and once featured the largest stand of white pine in the world. <ORGANIZATION> Lumberjacks </ORGANIZATION> used to transport logs on the <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the sawmills of <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION> in gigantic wooden flotillas complete with tents for cooking and sleeping. <ORGANIZATION> Lumberjacks </ORGANIZATION> will chop, saw and climb trees as <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION> showcases its logging heritage with the grand finals of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> in May, 1990. People from all races came to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to work the mines, farm or build the railroads. The centennial honors them all with celebrations or interpretive studies. In the midst of World War II in 1942, 9,400 Japanese-Americans were relocated to the wind-swept <ORGANIZATION> Minidoka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relocation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Twin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> in south-central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The Japanese <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> plans to build an interpretive center at the camp. Basques from the Spanish Pyrenees migrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from the 1800s on to tend sheep bands. <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> is the largest enclave of Basques in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They plan their second Jaialdi cultural festival in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> in June, 1990, drawing Basques from the West and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. When American explorers <PERSON> Meriwether </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> passed into <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Lolo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> in 1805, they met friendly Shoshone and <PERSON> Nez </PERSON> <PERSON> Perce </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> tribes who had roamed through northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> on spotted appaloosa horses for centuries. They are two of the state's six tribes that will meet for the first time in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> on July 9-15 for an `` All Idaho Indian Expo'' to present their histories, dreams and social issues. The Idaho Centennial calendar lists more than 500 events next year, from an <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cowboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poetry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gathering </ORGANIZATION> to a whistle stop tour of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>'s steam engine No. 8444. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s Statehood Day celebration will run 43 hours from July 2 to Independence Day with a dizzying schedule of fireworks and parades `` Former Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said ` I want a celebration of one million,'' meaning he wanted every man, woman and child involved,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` We're coming as close to that as we can.''

 It's <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s newest beach and one of its largest, but it attracts no swimmers and few sunbathers. Except for naturalists or small groups of tourists who come for a quick look and snapshots, it's usually deserted. `` Kamoamoa is now the largest of the black sand beaches,'' said <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Okamura </PERSON>, assistant scientist in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>'s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. The new beach was formed after lava from the eruption of <LOCATION> Kilauea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Volcano </LOCATION> began flowing into the ocean three years ago. More than a half-mile long and about 25 yards wide, it is bigger than <PERSON> Kaimu </PERSON>, the famed <LOCATION> Kalapana </LOCATION> black sand beach nearby, <PERSON> Okamura </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Kamoamoa </LOCATION> was formed the same way all other black sand beaches are formed,'' he said. ` ` When the molten lava pours into the ocean, the cooling effect of the water shatters the rock,'' he said Ocean currents then push the minute particles to shore, he explained. The 23-mile coastline of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Volcanoes National Park is now pocked with small black-sand beaches, he said. A 25-foot cliff previously formed the shoreline boundary of the <LOCATION> Kamoamoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campground </LOCATION>, located six miles west of <LOCATION> Kalapana </LOCATION>, a village on <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>'s southeast coast. Now, the wide beach with its steep slope to the water adjoins the campground. `` The sand was pushed up against the cliff.'' <PERSON> Okamura </PERSON> said. `` The cliff is now buried under the sand. `` I think the beach enhanced the campground,'' he said. `` It's a beautiful place to camp.'' `` The campground is the nicest on the island, but is not heavily used,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>, chief naturalist at the national park. `` Before the lava flow, it was little used; we get a few more campers now, mostly island people who come to see the lava,'' he said. From the grassy, palm tree-lined campground and the adjoining beach, visitors can see the huge smoke and steam plumes which waft out to sea from the points where the 2,200-degree lava pours into the 60-70-degree water. However, the beach is not very inviting to sunbathers. The sand formed by the lava particles is coarse, with sharp edges on the larger particles. `` It takes a lot of wave action to round out the particles,'' <PERSON> Okamura </PERSON> said. `` Right now, it's not very comfortable to walk on the sand barefoot.'' `` We tell people going to see the flow to stop in at the beach,'' <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> said. `` On a normal day, several thousand people visit the flow area but only 20-25 percent visit the beach.'' Signs posted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> prohibit swimming because of high surf and dangerous currents. Beaches began forming almost immediately after lava began flowing into the ocean in November, 1986, according to <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kamoamoa </PERSON> began appearing in mid-January 1988. Most of the sand is from the original entry point into the ocean about two miles east <LOCATION> Kamoamoa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Okamura </PERSON> said. Lava recently was entering the ocean at four points, the closest just one mile from the big beach, he said. <LOCATION> Kamoamoa </LOCATION> is 1 -LCB- miles west of the <ORGANIZATION> Wahaula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which was destroyed by lava on June 22, 1989. The new beach could disappear if and when the volcano, the source of the sand, ends its nearly seven-year-old eruption, <PERSON> Okamura </PERSON> said. `` Once the eruption stops, who knows how long the sand will last,'' he said. `` The beach is steep. Erosion or wave action probably will take it away,'' he said. However, no one knows when the eruption will end. `` Right now, the activity is as vigorous as ever,'' said <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Kilauea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Volcano </LOCATION>'s east rift zone eruption began on Jan. 3, 1983. Lava from the Pu ` u O ` o and <LOCATION> Kupaianaha </LOCATION> vents has flowed into residential areas on numerous occasions, destroying 74 homes.

 The first tune the children of <LOCATION> Spruga </LOCATION> seem to learn is that of the klaxons of the yellow Postbuses that wind their way through the mountains above <LOCATION> Locarno </LOCATION>, at the northern end of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maggiore </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ticino </LOCATION>. A child on his tricycle pedals fast toward a stranger and stops just short of a collision. He sings out like a klaxon and pedals off. Another child, restless on her mother's lap, echoes the klaxon warning of the bus as it rounds a series of tight curves. Spruga, <PERSON> Indemini </PERSON> and their fellow communities wrapped high into the Alps above <LOCATION> Locarno </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lugano </LOCATION> or tucked into the river valleys are groupings of gray stone houses with heavy-looking, gray slate roofs. The gray, cobbled streets are often stairs. All look as if they had been, and would be, there forever. Geraniums and other flowers add a blast of color. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> and pastures are all around and much of the year, a sound heard even more frequently than that of the klaxon is that of cowbells. At the foot of the mountains lie <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maggiore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Locarno </LOCATION>, with palm and fig trees, oleanders and flowers and accessible lakefront. There are restaurants galore, an <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Lido </LOCATION>. On market day, booths along its main street sell everything from kitchen utensils to raincoats to jewelry made in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The long arcade along the street is a sort of permanent market: sneakers and scarves, toys and teddy bears, and food of all kinds, including almonds that a smiling old lady dips in hot caramel. The arcade is a splendid shelter on a rainy day -LRB- <LOCATION> Locarno </LOCATION>, famous for its sunshine, does have rain, too -RRB-. Another indoor spot demanding a visit is the museum in the Castello Visconteo, a centuries-old restored castle whose exhibits range from <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Arp </PERSON>'s paintings to Roman glass, bronzes and other artifacts from the first century As one dines at the Trattoria da <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON>, takes the funicular to the shrine of the <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, or the lake boats to <LOCATION> Muralto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Luino </PERSON> and the like, one sinks into the feeling of being in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The names, the flowers, the sun, the blue water, the stuccoed buildings in pink and cream suggest the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. But it is <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, though the Swiss did n't get hold of it for keeps until the 16th century. <LOCATION> Locarno </LOCATION> was a commercial crossroads and military base under the Romans, who called the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Celtic </ORGANIZATION> people they found there the <LOCATION> Helvetii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> defeated them in the Gallic Wars and then made allies of them. <LOCATION> Locarno </LOCATION> also was the scene in 1925 of an international conference including <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and a number of other nations that drew up a series of mutual guarantees known as the <LOCATION> Locarno </LOCATION> Pact, supposed to create a spirit of peace and goodwill. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s foreign secretary at the time, <PERSON> Austen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, was a key figure at the meeting. <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> denounced the pact in 1936 and remilitarized the Rhineland. -LRB- <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>'s half-brother, <LOCATION> Neville </LOCATION>, later <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister, signed another, more notorious peace pact with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> in 1938 at <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> with similar results, with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> as the pawn. -RRB- But the average visitor to <LOCATION> Locarno </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Maggiore </PERSON> and its sister lake, <LOCATION> Lugano </LOCATION>, will probably save historical research for another time, concentrating instead on the lake boats and the mountains. Heading south from <LOCATION> Locarno </LOCATION>, he soon will truly be in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. On the way, he can stop at <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Brissago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isles </LOCATION>, where a botanical garden has plants from subtropical regions all over the world _ <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. This is just a foretaste of what's waiting at the south end of the lake, on <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Borromeo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, owned since the early 16th century by the <PERSON> Borromeo </PERSON> family _ prominent, rich and devout. -LRB- <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Borromeo </PERSON>, who died in 1584, was canonized. -RRB- The garden at <LOCATION> Isola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madre </LOCATION> with its bitter orange, mimosa, Egyptian papyrus and banana trees has five terraces and a palace _ relatively modest by 18th century palatial standards. White and blue-green peacocks stroll the lawns and pheasants are almost under foot. On <PERSON> Isola </PERSON> <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>, the gardens are more elaborate: ten terraces, surmounted by a multistoried sculpture with niches containing figures and sculpted scallop shells. Statues are silhouetted against the sky. Atop the whole thing is the sculpted family symbol, a unicorn. It's baroque, beautiful _ and blatant. The enormous palace -LRB- one guidebook quotes French author <PERSON> Gustave </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaubert </PERSON> as saying it could have accommodated 2,000 people -RRB- is on a par with the gardens. There are a weapons and armor room, a tapestry gallery, a room where <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> and his family stayed as guests, and three theaters, including a Hell Theater, with marionettes symbolizing the environment and a two-pipe organ to produce lugubrious sounds. Lying between <PERSON> Isola </PERSON> <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Isola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madre </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Isola </PERSON> <PERSON> dei </PERSON> <PERSON> Pescatori </PERSON>, a longtime fishing village which has narrow streets and stone houses, but also a heavy overlay of tourists and vendors.

 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, virtually on the eve of losing its status as a British crown colony, will become a part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> again in 1997. The Chinese have promised not to tamper with their new possession for 50 years after that, but confidence in that promise has been severely shaken by the bloody suppression of the democratic movement on the mainland last spring. In the meantime, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> remains a tourist's delight. The colony consists of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a host of smaller, satellite islands, <LOCATION> Kowloon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> on the mainland, and the New Territories, which extend all the way up to the border with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. One of the more pleasant surprises awaiting a first-time visitor to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is the ease with which one can get from place to place. The subways are swift, virtually noiseless, clean, and free of graffiti. Instructions -LRB- in both English and Chinese -RRB- are conspicuous and easy to read. Uniformed agents stand outside turnstiles to answer questions. Buses and trolleys _ big, lumbering, multicolor double-deckers _ also can take you anywhere. The top deck offers the better view of the passing scene. And do n't overlook the Star Ferry _ a small fleet that runs between <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kowloon </LOCATION>. First class is only 9 cents. But the best way to get from here to there is by cab. Taxis are clean, comfortable and air-conditioned. The drivers are polite, friendly and informative. Best of all, cabs are cheap, a third what you pay in the larger stateside cities. Tipping is not expected but it is customary to leave some portion of your change. Equally pleasant will be the shopping bargains you'll encounter, such as jade in msny colors, ivory both old and new, batik and beautifully delicate cloissone. Cameras or electronics are not a good buy in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>; never mind that they are made there. You can do better back in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. There is a multiplicity of places to shop. Check out <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION>, the Chinese Arts and <ORGANIZATION> Crafts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Yue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> on the far side of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Look for the decal in the shop window that identifies the merchant as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a pledge of value for money. And do n't overlook the night markets _ garishly lit outdoor areas that open when the commercial establishments close. You can shop, eat and shop some more. When you tear yourself from your shopping spree, you will want to eat. You'll find chicken, duck, pork and denizens of the deep in varieties you may never have heard of. Service, decor and preparation of dishes are impeccable. Your hotel will help you find good restaurants and will make reservations for you. Some good examples: the Man Wah Restaurant in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barbecue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the Royal Thai and, near the Chinese border in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territories </LOCATION>, the Yucca de Lac. Like most major cities, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is full of things to see and do, but if you are pressed for time there is one absolute must: <ORGANIZATION> Victoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peak </ORGANIZATION>. The peak is the highest point on <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and is the vantage point for one of the most dazzling views in the world. It is reachable by bus or taxi, but the most enjoyable way to get there is `` the tram to the peak.'' The view is spectacular at night, when the jeweled city and harbor are spread out at your feet. But it is equally spellbinding in the daytime, when a clear blue sky forms a canopy over the noonday splendor of the city.

 If you're looking for a ride on the wild side, look North. Not only do the <LOCATION> Adirondack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> offer the largest wilderness area in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Adirondack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> encompasses some 6 million acres _ they are home to three of the wildest rides imaginable. There is only one place in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where you can pay a fee and take a ride down an Olympic bobsled run: <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Placid </LOCATION>. Officials at the Olympic complex here call the bobrun the `` Champagne of Thrills,'' and it's easy to see why. The only drawback is that the ride is short-lived _ it only takes a minute or so to make the half-mile run. But even though Olympians travel at speeds approaching 90 mph, at 55 it's sometimes hard to imagine you'll arrive alive. Especially on the final turn, where it seems as though the sled will slam right into the solid wall of ice bordering the left side of track. The rides at the Olympic Bobrun, which have been offered at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hoevenberg </LOCATION> since the 1930s, this year have taken on a new dimension with the addition of six new sleds capable of carrying three or four passengers along with the driver and brakeman. They replace the old sleds, which were built in the 1940s. `` We needed to replace our existing sleds because eventually things wear out,'' says <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamy </PERSON>, who designed the new sleds and also manages the Bobrun. The rides cost $ 15 and are offered Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to noon and from 1-3 p.m. And even though they do n't begin where the Olympians do, they do n't leave out the two most famous turns in the sport _ everybody Zigs and everybody <ORGANIZATION> Zags </ORGANIZATION>. Just a few feet away from the bobrun sits one of the most amazing sights in all of sports _ the luge run. Watching lugers navigate the twisting turns of the ice-covered course at speeds approaching 80 miles per hour on television does n't do this sport justice. It must be seen in person to be believed, and even then it seems unbelievable. But there's a cure for disbelievers. Yep, you can take a ride on one of those tiny little things the Europeans have the audacity to call a sled. The only catch is nobody will share your fear once you start sliding _ you're on your own after a minute-long `` crash course'' on luging. Pay strict attention to your coach if you want, but you'll probably forget what he said on the first turn. The first 10 feet are n't bad, but when you get to a horseshoe-shaped turn called Omega, you'll no doubt wonder why they did n't name the course that instead. Traveling feet-first at 35 miles an hour and unable to see exactly where you're going is somewhat unsettling, but chances are you'll be alternately saying to yourself _ `` I wish this ride was over! I hope this lasts forever! Am I out of my mind, or what!'' Nevertheless, one ride is all it takes to see how easy it is to get hooked on the sport. For $ 10 you can get hooked on Saturdays and Sundays, from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Both luge rides are subject to weather and track conditions, so call first -LRB- 518-523-4436 -RRB-. Not far to the west of the Olympic complex sits <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marcy </ORGANIZATION>, the state's highest peak, and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tear </LOCATION> of the Clouds _ the source of the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the source of perhaps the most thrilling of the three rides. The <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorge </LOCATION>, virtually inaccessible even today, is located about 20 miles to the southwest. In the first half of this century, logging was big business in the North Country. The timber companies pulled out in the 1950s, and since the late 1970s, rafts have replaced the logs. Each April and May thousands of thrill-seekers show up to raft the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, which each year becomes a raging torrent by melting snow and releases from the Abanakee Dam in the village of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. Adventurers can choose from 11 outfitters. Overnight trips are offered, but the four-hour, 16-mile ones are the most popular. All are made in 160-pound rubber and fabric rafts that, at first glance, look too flimsy to withstand collisions with rocks and jolts of the rapids. Instructions for this ride are short and sweet, but vastly more important because your life may be at stake if you make a mistake. You'll hear the following before you get on the river: `` If you fall in _ and someone usually does _ roll on your back and get your feet pointed downstream. If you get separated from the boat, work your way to shore, and we'll come and get you.'' With the water temperature usually at around 40 degrees in early spring, you'll pray they wo n't have to come for you.

 Tour operators, recognizing the growing popularity of snowmobiling, are introducing winter vacationers to the adventure of going where only a snowmobile can go, from <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to the north woods of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, from interior <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. There are more than 100,000 miles of groomed snowmobile trails in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Bombardier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, manufacturers of Ski-Doo snowmobiles. The company says snowmobilers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> spend more than $ 3.2 billion on the sport each year, including equipment, clothing, accessories and vacations, with nearly 130,000 snowmobiles sold in the two nations last year.

 What you might call `` low-impact tourism,'' ecologically sensitive travel or adventure cruising, is inspiring the travel industry to offer tour packages reflecting interest in the environment. As one travel firm, <ORGANIZATION> Sobek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expeditions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, put it in announcing environmental adventures for 1990 in such places as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> India-Nepal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>: `` -LRB- We -RRB- hope to translate enthusiasm for wild places into energy directed toward their preservation.'' Another organization, Overseas Adventure Travel of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, offers birding in remote rain forests of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, gorilla trekking in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, hiking in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, safaris in <LOCATION> Serengeti </LOCATION> and treks in Machu Picchu National Park in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. `` On an adventure cruise, passengers take an active role in every aspect of the expedition,'' says <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passengers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Naturalists and lecturers are aboard each ship to provide background information and regional observations about wildlife.'' Because of the briefings, lectures and a laboratory at sea, there is a cultural and intellectual element not found on other cruise ships, explains <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, author of the <ORGANIZATION> Berlitz </ORGANIZATION> `` Complete Handbook to Cruising.'' The adventure cruise vessel, he adds, provides elegant and comfortable surroundings for up to 200 passengers, a highly trained and knowledgeable staff and first-class food. `` Without traditional cruise ports to stop at, the ship must be self-sufficient and capable of long-range cruising,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> says. Many of the cruises use small inflatable rubber boats known as Zodiacs to get closer to their wildlife destinations because the mother ships are too large to navigate some shallow rivers and tributaries. Developed by famed explorer <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON>, the boats hold up to 15 people and can penetrate deep into otherwise inaccessible areas. As <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> explains, `` the adventure cruise ship is seldom ` alongside' a dock and is more likely to be found at anchor in a small inlet or bay. For use as a diving base in warm waters, such as around <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s Great Barrier Reef, the Zodiac is ideal and is safe and unsinkable.'' Many conservation-oriented travel organizations play an active role in supporting environmental preservation programs. The Overseas Adventure group, for example, donates $ 40 per person participating in their <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> safaris to the Rhina Ark Fund, which helps finance the building of a fence to prevent poaching of rhinos. On Himalayan treks it uses no wood for cooking, which helps prevent further deforestation, and all trash is carried out of the mountains. In addition, a percentage of each trekker's fees goes to help maintain the trails and conservation programs. And Chicago-based Classic Tours International, which offers packages including cruises down <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, donates a portion of each tour program to organizations dedicated to the preservation of historic sites and the conservation of wildlife.

 Along with your shrink, your barkeep and perhaps your mother, the people you turn to for solace include travel agents. A survey commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agent </ORGANIZATION> magazine indicates that 88 percent of travelers interviewed prefer the reassurance and approval of a real person _ the travel agent _ when planning vacations. `` The customer is seeking verification from a respected source that travel plans are sound and that the trip is going to go well,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, the magazine's publisher. The survey, conducted by <PERSON> Oxtoby-Smith </PERSON>, a consumer research firm, also found that only half of the travel agent's clients have a firm idea of where they want to go when they seek the agent's services, and of those, two-thirds were willing to change their minds if the agent suggests a good alternative destination. _ About one in 10 travelers to foreign countries have at one time or other canceled or changed their travel plans because of fears of terrorism like airplane bombings and hijackings of cruise ships and planes, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> survey commissioned by Travel and Leisure magazine. The survey showed that most foreign travelers rank good airport security and a stable government in the destination country as most important factors in their travel choices. Both factors were cited by 79 percent of those surveyed. Also of importance are hospitality in the host country, good transportation, low crime rates and favorable exchange rates. _ A <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> hotel _ the <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> _ has risen fast in the estimation of senior financiers surveyed for their rankings of the world's 50 best hotels by <ORGANIZATION> Institional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> magazine.

The hotel did n't make the list at all in any previous year. More than 100 financiers, each averaging about 65 nights a year in hotels, served as panelists. Top ranked for the ninth consecutive year was the Oriental in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The Vier Jahreszeiten in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> was second, the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> third, the <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> fourth, and the Mandarin Oriental of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> fifth. _

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> families plan to spend an estimated $ 39 billion on Christmas gifts this year, up 4 percent to 5 percent from last year, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Defense Reductions Will Do Little for 1991 Budget
Woes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Battle lines in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are already being drawn over whether and how to spend the money the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plans to slice off next year's <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget. On one side are lawmakers who say liberalization in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> means the defense cuts should be large, and who want to use the money to beef up education, child care and other domestic programs that have been pinched in recent years. `` If the tearing down of the Berlin Wall means nothing more than we put the USS Missouri in <LOCATION> mothballs </LOCATION>, we will not have accomplished much,'' says liberal Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. Arrayed against them are others who want to use the savings to reduce the 1991 deficit to $ 64 billion, a goal universally seen as difficult yet one that is required by the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law `` There seems hardly any room for discussion that the ... defense savings go to anything but deficit reduction,'' says Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Dangling somewhere in between are senators and representatives who will be wary of defense cuts that affect military bases or contractors in their home districts. `` The light bulb in their heads says jobs,'' says <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissenbaum </PERSON>, a lobbyist for programs for low-income people. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> just finished its 1990 budget work on Nov. 22, the administration is already sketching out its spending blueprint for fiscal 1991, which begins next Oct. 1. That document will be presented to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 22. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is reportedly preparing budget plans that will pare up to $ 180 billion from planned <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending through 1994. Even if carried to the maximum, such cuts would reap little savings next year because of the nature of defense spending. In any given year, much of it is carried over from previous commitments _ such as an aircraft carrier on which construction began two years ago _ or is contained in difficult-to-break, long-term contracts stretching into the future. Even laying off troops brings with it offsetting expenses such as retirement payments, unemployment benefits and other costs. Because of that, the consensus among lawmakers and lobbyists is the reductions are likely to rein military spending by no more than $ 3 billion to $ 8 billion next year out of a nearly $ 300 billion Pentagon budget. The entire federal budget will be about $ 1.2 trillion. Such savings are but a tiny fraction of the $ 40 billion that many on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> expect will be needed to shave the 1991 deficit to the Gramm-Rudman target of $ 64 billion. `` The peace dividend is n't large, and there are a lot of claimants,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Although the defense buildup of the early <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration years left a lasting public impression of an ever-growing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the military budget has shrunk over the last five years when the effects of inflation are considered. The trend was considered likely to continue in 1991 even before <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> began considering reductions and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European countries began asserting more political independence from the Soviet bloc. House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., predicted `` a feeding frenzy'' last week by lawmakers eager to cut defense spending if the administration asks for a budget reduction But there's little question that the nation's defense system _ its bases and the companies that supply the weapons, food and other goods for them _ has a large base of support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Even so, the need for deficit-reduction is likely to lead lawmakers to take a bite out of the military budget. The fight over reaching the Gramm-Rudman deficit target is likely to also focus on elements that have been contested in recent budget years: higher taxes, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes, and domestic cuts, which Democrats reject. `` A responsible budget approach has to be balanced,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, who has issued similar calls in the past with limited success

 To <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Trojniar </PERSON> the pension dispute with his ex-employer turns on principles of justice and loyalty, but the opposing lawyers in the case of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Can </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> are trading charges of racketeering, terrorizing and coercion. Trojniar, now 49, is among some 2,500 former <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> employees who are suing the company in a class action arguing that they were laid off to prevent them from becoming eligible to collect pensions. `` In other words, they were n't loyal to us,'' said <PERSON> Trojniar </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` I would like to get what I got coming.'' Last May, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> sided with them. But the workers have n't seen a dime as the company appeals the ruling and a fight has broken out over how much should be paid to whom. In the meantime, Trojniar, who was laid off in 1978 just two years short of pension eligibility, is earning $ 5.50 an hour as a maintenance man at a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> chemical company. That's half of what he made feeding an aerosol can press for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. `` I gave them the good years, so to speak,'' he said. In its appeal <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> improperly extended his ruling from one plant to 46, allowed workers to join the class indiscriminately and ignored previous case law. The ex-workers' attorneys say the cost to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> could run to $ 1 billion. The other side expects a settlement in the $ 50 million range, said a source familiar with court proceedings who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Attorneys said there was little progress on a settlement. The dispute, involving dozens of attorneys at prominent firms nationwide, took a rancorous turn in October. The workers filed papers accusing <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s owner, <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kiewit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of siphoning off more than $ 1 billion from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to avoid having to pay a potentially huge judgment. Last month, <PERSON> Kiewit </PERSON> agreed to submit certain asset transfers or dividend payments to the judge's review. The company denies seeking to transfer funds to avoid paying a judgment. The workers' amended lawsuit also adds individual executives and <PERSON> Kiewit </PERSON> parent companies as defendants on a claim of racketeering. An attorney for the workers, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said that action was intended to hold the Kiewit companies accountable for their subsidiaries' responsibilities. But <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said that accusing the <PERSON> Kiewit </PERSON> companies and individuals of racketeering is a `` coercive, terrorizing event'' designed to inflate the amount of money the workers would receive in a settlement. Under the racketeering law, the defendants could be found liable for triple damages if they lose. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> also accused the lawyers of making the funds transfer allegation as a way to attack the company under cover of court papers, `` without facing any slander or defamation charges.'' The workers' court papers said that from the end of 1984, the year of its purchase, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s net worth dropped from $ 1.5 billion to $ 311 million by last March. Assets were sold to pay off loans for <PERSON> Kiewit </PERSON>'s leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, the court papers said. In addition, the workers contended, huge dividends were paid to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s parent _ amounting to $ 634 million in 1986 alone, when net earnings were $ 93 million. But <ORGANIZATION> Kiewit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermas </PERSON> said assets were sold to pay off debt as in any other leveraged buyout, and many of them were non-can related, such as insurance, oil and gas and timberland interests. `` Whatever transfer of funds from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Can that occurred were fully explainable by other good, legitimate business reasons that had no relation whatsoever to this lawsuit,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Award Accounting Firm Ordered to Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today left intact a $ 1.24 million award a leading accounting firm was ordered to pay to a water heater manufacturer. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION>, the accounting firm sued successfuly by <ORGANIZATION> Bradford-White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes water heaters at a <LOCATION> Middleville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, plant. Bradford-White, a <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> corporation, in 1981 bought out another water heater manufacturer, W.L. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tenn </PERSON>. In connection with that deal, <PERSON> Bradford-White </PERSON> accused <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whinney </LOCATION>, the accountants for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, of falsely reporting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s financial condition. The accounting firm had reported <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was in financial trouble. But <PERSON> Bradford-White </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION> concealed just how bad matters were, and contended that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was on the verge of bankruptcy. The lawsuit alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whinney </PERSON> violated federal and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> securities laws. Bradford-White was awarded $ 1.24 million by a federal jury in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Bradford-White has offices in that city. A federal judge later overturned the award, ruling that the verdict was inconsisent with some of the jury's own finding. But the 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated the award last April. The appeals court said there might have been some inconsistencies, but there is no doubt the jury believed <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION> misstated <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s net worth. The appeals court also rejected the accounting firm's claim that <PERSON> Bradford-White </PERSON> waited too long to sue. <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION> waived any such claim at the trial and can not rely on it on appeal, the 3rd Circuit court said. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Bradford-White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 89-604.

 Details of a new employee-led buyout plan for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> are expected to be presented this week to at least one of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' three major unions, union officials said. The move would follow ongoing negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> and unions for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants, pilots and machinists aimed at refashioning a bid for the parent company. Expectations that a revised bid would be forthcoming sent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock sharply higher this morning. It surged $ 5 to $ 179 a share by noon on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, adding to Friday's jump of $ 12.50. Negotiations have taken place with all three unions since the New York-based investment group <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> last month began proceedings to oust 13 of the company's 15 directors, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said Sunday. In a recorded message to employees, the flight attendants on Friday said that negotiations between their union and company negotiators would resume Wednesday. At the meeting, `` top <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> management is expected to present us with details of a new employee ownership plan,'' with similar presentations expected in meetings with the pilots and machinists, the recording said. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Friend </PERSON>, outgoing president of the flight attendants' union, said today she did not know when those meetings are scheduled, and spokesmen for the other two unions could not be reached early today to comment Ms. Friend said that while a revised buyout plan may be presented at Wednesday's meeting, `` We're a long way away from an agreement that would require a vote.'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> declined to comment on whether an offer would be presented to the flight attendants or other employees this week. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the `` odds are pretty good'' that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> is working quickly to wrap up a new deal with employees. A previous buyout attempt led by pilots, senior management and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> failed in October when bank financing fell through for the $ 300-a-share, $ 6.75 billion offer. The resignations this weekend of two officers of the flight attendants union _ Friend and Vice President <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> _ could also mean a deal is near, <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said. `` The flight attendants have not been as cooperative under -LRB- Friend and <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said Sunday in a telephone interview. `` This may be a sign that perhaps they are easing their stance.'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said Sunday in a telephone interview that `` discussions have been taking place since the <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> announced they are going ahead on the consent solicitation bid.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> has boosted its <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stake to 11.8 percent from 9.7 percent, general partner <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Gollust </PERSON> said today, but he declined comment on the buyout situation. The group has said only that it intends to pursue an `` extraordinary transaction'' to benefit <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> investors if it wins control of the company's board with the permission of shareholders. Friend and <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> announced their resignations to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 14,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, saying the time has come for new leadership to step in to deal with a new <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> and stalled contract talks <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> warned, however, that consent from the nearly 25,000-member machinists union will be key to any revised buyout offer. Opposition from the machinists to the previous buyout offer led in part to the banks' decision to withdraw financing. `` They still need outside financing, even if they do strike a deal with the unions,'' <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said. `` It's got to come from the banks in the form of loans and equity contributions or from individual groups, such as the pilots.''

 Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as a lack of news over the weekend reduced interest in the market. `` There was not a lot of news over the weekend,'' to stimulate buying interest, said analyst <ORGANIZATION> Steve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> A lack of export demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans and favorable weather in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> crop areas put pressure on soybean futures, Freed said. Corn prices were lower, despite Friday's announcement of a purchase by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Analysts say that news had been factored into the market. Also, word that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bid for 400,000 metric tons of wheat under the export bonus program failed to lift wheat prices today. Analysts said investors were awaiting the outcome of this week's U.S.-Soviet grain talks to determine the level of Soviet buying interest In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.06 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 \ cents lower with December at $ 2.32 \ a bushel; oats were a \ cent to 1 cent lower with December at $ 1.43 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with January at $ 5.72 \ Livestock and pork futures were generally lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Pork prices were pressured by lower hog cash prices due to light packer demand and profit taking by investors in frozen pork bellies. Live cattle futures were pushed lower by expectations of lower cash prices for fed cattle this week, a traditional period of low weak retail beef demand. Live cattle were .02 cent to .20 cent lower with December at 75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .03 cent higher with January at 82.77 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower to .10 cent higher with December at 50.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .22 cent lower to unchanged with February at 57.50 cents a pound. Livestock futures settled higher and pork prices lower in Friday's trading.

The latest session came the week after the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, representing flight attendants, called off their sympathy strikes. They had joined the 8,500 mechanics and other Eastern ground workers represented by the Machinists in walking out March 4 when 1 -LCB- years of federally mediated talks. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said management met Monday with the flight attendants union, will meet again Friday, and plans four days of negotiations beginning Dec. 18. The company is waiting to hear from a federal mediator on the next round of talks with the pilots, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. The pilots and flight attendants are in negotiations on new contracts and also on the return to work of their members. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said the other unions' actions did n't affect his union's strike He noted that Eastern told the returning strikers they had no jobs for them and they would have to go on a waiting list. `` I think it certainly was predictable that they are playing the hardest of hardball, in the most arrogant way. -LRB- Eastern has been -RRB- very condescending, saying: ` We do n't have any jobs but we might do them a favor and take some of them back.''' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, who contends that Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has been out to break <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions and cannibalize the carrier since his <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bought it nearly four years ago, has portrayed the unions' struggle in terms of good versus evil. He now draws comparisons to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> denied that his union's talk of going underground implied illegal activity. Eastern last week gained a preliminary injunction ordering the Machinists to refrain from harassment, threats and trespassing. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said the union plans a range of activities that includes an organized effort to urge anyone associated with the travel industry to boycott <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The company says it has 2,800 mechanics, including about 300 Machinists who have crossed picket lines, and rejects suggestions of maintenance difficulties. There were some 4,500 Machinists mechanics who struck. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> was interviewed here Sunday after attending the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s conference. He chatted with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who urged him to keep up his fight because `` it's important for this country.''

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as commission house selling dominated trading activity. Continued concern over the lack of export sales weighed on the market, said analyst <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Biedermann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Allendale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Indications from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that soybean crops will have adequate soil moisture to get off to a good growing start was a major drag on prices, <PERSON> Biedermann </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> resigned today as the government's chief regulator of savings and loans, saying he was made a `` scapegoat to shoulder the blame for the entire thrift crisis'' and the record bailout of the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. As he has done before, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> insisted at a packed news conference and in his resignation letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he did nothing wrong and leaves with `` personal integrity that will stand up to any scrutiny.'' But he said the fact that he was the `` primary target'' of a congressional investigation would create a hardship at the Office of Thrift Supervision, which he directed. Wall complained about a `` steady stream of one-sided information emanating from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearings concerning my handling of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan.'' He specifically cited Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, whom he accused of resorting to `` corruption of the truth and abandonment of our historical devotion to fair play and due process in his effort to remove me from office,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> had `` done the best thing for himself and the federal regulatory system ... The savings and loan disaster has been extremely costly in terms of dollars and public confidence. It was essential that there be new leadership.'' For nearly two months, Wall has been the chief target of hearings by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> into why federal regulators allowed <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> to remain open until last April even though examiners had recommended in May 1987 that it be closed. The bailout of the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, institution is expected to cost taxpayers up to $ 2.5 billion. Wall has maintained there was not enough evidence to seize <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and has dismissed allegations that he declined to act because of political pressure from five senators who intervened on behalf of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` As I testified under oath, neither political influence nor <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> affected my decision on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said in his resignation letter `` Nor for that matter have I ever made decisions for political reasons during my tenure as chairman and director.'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> faces a federal grand jury investigation in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and he is the target of a $ 1.1 billion fraud and racketeering suit brought by federal regulators. Wall said, `` The simplistic efforts to find a scapegoat to shoulder the blame for the entire thrift crisis led various critics to join in the hue and cry raised by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman for my departure from office.'' Wall testified for 10 hours before <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s committee in late November. Following Wall's appearance, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said of his testimony, `` somehow it rings very hollow to say the huge regulatory bureaucracy could do nothing, did nothing, as the institution -LRB- <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> -RRB- went down.'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said he did not like running from a fight, but he was unwilling to continue battling his critics at the risk of harming the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` The recent hearings consumed a great deal of our energies as we prepared our response and the prospect of continued hearings with me as the primary target would cause disruption at <ORGANIZATION> OTS </ORGANIZATION> at a time when the agency staff needs to devote its attention to revitalizing the thrift industry,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. Wall was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> from July 1987 until last August, when its function as the federal regulator of the savings and loan industry was transferred to the new Office of Thrift Supervision. Wall's resignation came amid a flood of calls for his resignation or ouster, among them <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>; several public interest groups and major newspapers. `` Time will indeed be kind to us,'' Wall predicted in a television interview Nov. 26, saying that two congressional investigations of the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> collapse would prove his decisions justified. In the same interview he conceded making mistakes in handling the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> case but said he had no plan `` at this point'' to resign. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing the conduct of the five senators: <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commitee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> is a Republican, the others Democrats. Under the S & amp; L bailout legislation passed in August, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s term extends until July 1, 1991. He was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and as part of the legislative package was named director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, which replaced the bank board as the regulator of thrifts. The office is an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market was higher in afternoon trading today. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 6.83 points at 2,754.48 at 3 pm EST, the same level as one hour earlier.

 Pharmaceuticals giant <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, reporting its first results since a merger earlier this year, said Monday that its nine-month pre-tax profit rose 12 percent. The company did not provide net profit and earnings per share. It also did not specify third-quarter results. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> said the statement was a `` progress report'' rather than a full earnings announcement. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> merged in July through an exchange of shares, creating the world's second-largest pharmaceuticals company after <LOCATION> Rahway </LOCATION>, N.J.-based <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> said its pre-tax profit for the nine months ended Sept. 30 came to 587.3 million pounds, or the equivalent $ 920 million, compared with 524.3 million pounds, or $ 822 million, in the same period a year ago Nine-month trading profit rose 15.9 percent to 626.5 million pounds from 540.6 million pounds, the company said. Sales from continuing operations rose 18 percent to 3.2 billion pounds from 2.7 billion pounds. Sales were boosted by a 19 percent increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of the anti-ulcer drug Tagamet, the company said. The company used a rate of exchange of $ 1.5672 per British pound, the rate at the start of trading in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Monday.

 A revised employee buyout proposal being readied by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executives could value the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> at between $ 4.75 billion and $ 5.42 billion, sharply lower than an earlier, aborted proposal, analysts said Monday. Analysts said a new bid, the successor to the failed $ 6.75 billion buyout led by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots union and management, might be unveiled in time for consideration at a scheduled Dec. 13 meeting of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> representatives are expected to present details of a new buyout plan to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants' union on Wednesday. The company has met recently with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese bankers, representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots' union and <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, an investor group that is pushing for a sale or restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 5.50 a share to $ 179.50 in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, adding to Friday's $ 12.50 a share gain. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Friend </PERSON>, outgoing president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> chapter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that a revised buyout plan may be presented at this week's meeting. But she added: `` We're a long way away from an agreement that would require a vote.'' Nevertheless, airline industry analysts and stock-market investors speculated that the pieces of a new bid were falling rapidly into place. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> told its employees on Friday that executives were working on a revised proposal for employee purchase of the airline company. `` It looks like they're really trying to put together a takeover deal here,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 300 a share offer from the pilots, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> senior management and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> fell through after the group failed to get the necessary financing. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock has traded sharply lower. <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> figured the new deal would be for $ 210 to $ 240 a share. Another analyst said he had spoken with a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilot who `` threw out a $ 220 number.'' Analyst <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buttrick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said lenders who balked at and doomed the $ 300-a-share offer probably would agree to finance a deal at $ 225. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management is believed to be seeking strong commitments from lenders and the company's three major unions before announcing a revised buyout effort. The earlier pilot-management bid failed in October when lenders refused to finance it, citing the strong opposition of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. The Machinists represent about 25,000 of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s 70,000 employees <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots long have sought ownership of the carrier, the nation's second-largest, and are believed to be working with management on the new proposal. Spokesman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, declined comment Monday. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, an adviser to the Machinists union, said no meetings between representatives of his union and <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> had been held recently and he knew of none scheduled. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> did not return telephone calls. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said the company's financial advisers already had met with the pilots and were planning to meet with the flight attendants, who also had not joined the earlier pilots-management buyout group.

 The stock market rose Monday, but its advance failed to pack the punch of Friday's impressive rally. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials advanced 5.98 points to 2,753.63, its ninth-highest close ever. Advancing issues edged out declining ones by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of stocks listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 810 issues up, 708 down and 469 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 150.36 million shares, down from 199.20 million in Friday's session. Analysts said the market was buoyed mainly by takeover speculation involving several stocks and strength in technology issues. Investors' hopes for lower interest rates, which had catapulted Wall Street higher last Friday and lifted the Dow Jones average 41.38 points, appeared less solid on Monday. `` A lot of focus is on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, N.Y. The market will have to see Friday's scheduled government report on unemployment in November before regaining confidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will ease credit by nudging interest rates lower, he said. Wall Street also seemed a bit disappointed with the results of the U.S.-Soviet summit this past weekend, analysts said. Hopes for the summit had helped spark Friday's rally. The market shrugged off Monday's report by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods fell 0.2 percent in October to their lowest level since July. `` The market is an even-keel affair,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Nothing positive nor negative.'' The factory orders report was the latest indicator showing the economy slowing as the year draws to an end. The manufacturing sector has been particularly weak, prompting concern of possible layoffs and a rise in the unemployment rate. Traders also were unperturbed by news that <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, under fire for his handling of the costliest savings and loan failure in history, resigned as the government's chief <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulator.

 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories dropped 0.2 percent in October, the second straight monthly decline, the government said Monday in its latest report on the sluggishness gripping the industrial sector of the economy. `` It really corresponds with what is happening in the economy,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON>, chief economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for both durable and non-durable manufactured goods fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 233.9 billion following a revised 1 percent decline in September. September originally was reported to be unchanged following a 2.8 percent increase in August. The level of orders was the lowest since $ 230.4 billion were written last July. Durable goods _ `` big-ticket'' items that are expected to last more than three years _ fell 1.3 percent to $ 123.6 billion. Since they often are financed through loans, they have born the brunt of high interest rates resulting from <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> efforts to slow the economy and contain inflation. `` In manufacturing, the durable part is really hurting badly, primarily because autos are doing so poorly now,'' <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> said. `` The non-durable portion of the economy is not doing terribly because consumption spending on non-durables really is pretty strong.'' Non-durable orders were up 1.1 percent to $ 110.3 billion, led by gains in foods, chemicals and tobacco products. Automobile sales have fallen steadily since car makers began the new model year in October by dropping incentives and posting higher sticker prices. But despite the decline in auto sales, transportation orders rose 1.7 percent because of increases in orders for commercial aircraft and defense shipbuilding. Excluding transportation, however, orders would have fallen 0.5 percent. Without the defense category, orders would have been up 0.3 percent. Orders in the volatile defense category declined 12.1 percent in October. Shipments of manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent to $ 232.2 billion, while inventories rose 0.3 percent to $ 371.9 billion. If inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new orders, it could signal production cutbacks in the future as factories attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots. Machine industries led the decline in durable goods orders. Non-electrical machinery dropped 6.7 percent, with office and computing equipment accounting for nearly 40 percent of the drop. Electrical machinery orders were off 4.1 percent, much of the decline concentrated in communications equipment. Primary metals orders were down 3.2 percent. In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of business investment plans, orders rose 1.2 percent _ the first increase since a 5.9 percent gain last July.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar finished mixed against major foreign currencies Monday as traders renewed their interest in the West German mark. Gold prices tumbled more than $ 12 an ounce, retreating after a strong advance recently. Traders said last week that bullion was getting overvalued and that such a drop was possible. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery dropped $ 12.50 a troy ounce to $ 401.10. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at $ 401.20 as of 4 p.m. EST, $ 12.30 lower than Friday's late bid. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Money </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said currency dealers directed attention mainly to the West German mark and bought on speculation that the country will have to raise interest rates to stem a possible surge in economic growth. The Swiss franc was weighed down by heavy selling pressure related to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s lower interest rates compared with its European neighbors, particularly <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. Trading in dollars is expected to be light this week ahead of Friday's potentially market-moving report on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment. A government report that said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factory orders fell 0.2 percent in October evoked little reaction among dollar traders although it reinforced the notion that economic growth is sluggish. Currency dealers overseas, meanwhile, were said to be closing out positions before the year end. Market volume tends to dry up toward the end of the year, when dealers are hesitant to risk profits or add to losses. Dealers also were expected to remain reluctant to trade heavily while they assess the outcome of the weekend's superpower summit and what it will mean for the future of the dollar and the world economy. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to a closing 143.48 Japanese yen from 143.08 yen at Friday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it rose further to 143.57 yen and, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 143.65 from 143.40 late Friday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.5638 from $ 1.5665 late Friday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fell to $ 1.56225 from $ 1.5625 late Friday. Other dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Friday's late quotes included: 1.78425 West German marks, down from 1.7865; 1.6065 Swiss francs, up from 1.5995; 6.0915 French francs, down from 6.1020; 1,314.50 Italian lire, down from 1,316.50; and 1.16365 Canadian dollars, down from 1.6505. Selected late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Friday were: 1.7808 West German marks, down from 1.7825; 1.5995 Swiss francs, up from 1.5925; 6.0800 French francs, down from 6.0875; 2.0095 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0150; 1,312.00 Italian lire, down from 1,313.25; and 1.1640 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1662. Precious metals prices declined in what dealers described as a technically motivated correction to a powerful runup. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 406.25 a troy ounce from $ 414 bid late Friday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the metal fell to a closing bid of $ 408 from $ 415 bid late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 2.79 to close at $ 409.31. Silver for current delivery slid to $ 5.509 a troy ounce from $ 5.663 on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex. Silver bullion fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 5.60 a troy ounce from $ 5.70 bid late Friday.

 Some 40,000 <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers returned to work Monday, 116 days after they began a bitter strike, and began tackling a tremendous backlog on phone installations. `` Everybody's now back to work. We are delighted to see them all. The priority is attacking this backlog,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonomo </PERSON>. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> and 20,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Telephone struck the regional telephone company on Aug. 6. The strike affected 10 million customers. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> had predicted widespread animosity when their members returned, but that apparently was not the case Monday. `` People are reporting back to work with a few minor incidents that have not led to anything serious,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> area director for downstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. That week other strikes began in 20 states and all were resolved by September except for the one at <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> returned to work Nov. 20 after its members and the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> reached agreement with <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> on regional issues. Local issues continued to hang up the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> negotiations until Nov. 23. A ratification vote ended Friday with 85 percent of the members approving the contract. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> said it was trying to fill more than 100,000 service orders and a potential backlog of another 150,000 installations with customers who withheld orders during the work stoppage. Filling those orders will take until May, the company said. Repair work, it said, is up to date. To clear the backlog, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> initiated a five-point program that includes increasing its installation workforce by nearly 50 percent.

 Cold weather in parts of the nation helped boost heating oil futures prices Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Prices of other energy futures, including crude oil and unleaded gasoline, closed mixed. No. 2 home heating oil for January delivery advanced 0.88 cent to 63.79 cents a gallon. Contracts for delivery through June posted gains of between 0.09 cent and 0.65 cent. Energy analysts said strength in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s gasoil market spilled over into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets as low water levels on the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> continued to disrupt shipments. Gasoil is the British equivalent of heating oil. `` It creates logistical problems and gives our market a higher call,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Unger </PERSON>, energy broker with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. Icy temperatures in some parts of the country also gave the heating oil market a lift, he said. Profit-taking, meanwhile, erased the gains in the crude oil pits. The January contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, slipped 5 cents to $ 20.25 a barrel after trading as high as $ 20.62 during the session.

Wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery closed 0.41 cent higher at 52.52 cents a gallon, while later contracts posted slightly smaller gains.

 <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, under fire for his handling of what may become the costliest savings and loan failure in history, resigned Monday as the government's chief <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulator. In his letter of resignation to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> complained he was being made `` a scapegoat'' for the problems of the entire industry and denounced a `` steady stream of one-sided information'' from congressional hearings concerning the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has blamed Wall for allowing <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> to remain open until last April even though government examiners had recommended in May 1987 that it be closed The bailout of the institution is expected to cost taxpayers up to $ 2.5 billion. In turn, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> on Monday, saying he `` resorted to corruption of the truth'' in trying to force the regulator out. Wall's departure brought expressions of relief from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said in a statement, `` I know this was a difficult decision, but I commend him for taking the action so that the air may be cleared and we may move forward in dealing with the savings and loan crisis.'' He made no mention of Wall's accusations. Another committee member, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> `` deserves to go'' but added that he `` should not be held as the scepagoat for the thrift mess.'' Wall's mentor, Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, who brought him to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1975 as his chief aide, said <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> was `` a man of unquestionably solid character and integrity'' but was `` a convenient target for the critics who sought a scapegoat for the serious problems in the thrift industry.'' Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, whose department oversees <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, commended the regulator's decision to step down as `` public spirited. He added, `` We are beginning the search for a new <ORGANIZATION> OTS </ORGANIZATION> director and are committed to a smooth transition and the uninterrupted continuation of the agency's important work.'' According to an industry source, three candidates favored by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Syron </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roelle </PERSON>, who is in charge of S & amp; L rescue deals at the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a senior regulatory official at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> now serving as an adviser to the administration board that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>. Wall set no firm date for his departure, saying he would stay on for a transition period. He said he was looking forward to a job out of government but had no specific position in mind. For nearly two months, Wall has been the chief target of hearings by <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s panel. At first, only <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> called for his resignation, but in recent weeks the committee chairman was joined by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, private groups and several major newspapers. Neither <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> nor President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended Wall in public and, according to government sources, White House Counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was pushing for his ouster. Wall, however, declared to a packed news conference, `` This has been completely at my initiative.'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said he had offered to leave office last January, but the administration, which at that time was drafting proposed S & amp; L bailout legislation, wanted him to serve out his term through June 30, 1991. The investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has also stirred up trouble for five senators who intervened with regulators on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s behalf before <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> took office July 1, 1987. `` As I testified under oath, neither political influence nor <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> affected my decision on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said in his resignation letter. `` Nor for that matter have I ever made decisions for political reasons during my tenure as chairman and director.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee is investigating whether the senators _ <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, _ violated conflict-of-interest rules in their dealings with <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, millionaire who was instrumental in obtaining thousands of dollars in political contributions <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> faces a federal grand jury investigation in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and he is the target of a $ 1.1 billion fraud and racketeering suit brought by federal regulators. None of the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> suggested Wall personally profited from his Lincoln decisions, but Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that Wall `` put politics first and good public policy second'' and used `` excessively bad judgment. Wall said, `` The simplistic efforts to find a scapegoat to shoulder the blame for the entire thrift crisis led various critics to join in the hue and cry raised by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman for my departure from office.'' He said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> `` resorted to corruption of the truth and abandonment of our historical devotion to fair play and due process in his effort to remove me from office.'' Wall testified for 10 hours before <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s committee in late November after the committee had already conducted five all-day sessions to hear from <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s critics. The regulator attacked what he called the `` deliberately lopsided presentation'' during the hearings.

 <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s resignation Monday as the nation's chief thrift regulator came as no surprise in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where much of the industry's problems have been centered Politicians and industry officials said they believed Wall had become a symbol of the industry's failings and, as such, had to be replaced as head of the Office of Thrift Supervision. Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican who also serves on the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> was part of the solution, not part of the problem.'' But <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> added, `` I think -LRB- the resignation -RRB- was inevitable. That's not to say it was fair.'' Although it was Wall's slowness in closing down <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that was the catalyst for the current wave of criticism, <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said, `` I think <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> would have been, even without <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, a controversial person because he was solving problems. `` He left the savings and loan industry stronger than when he came in,'' <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said. Wall was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> from July 1987 until last August, when its function as the federal regulator of the savings and loan industry was transferred to the new Office of Thrift Supervision. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift landscape is much changed from Wall's <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plan </LOCATION>, devised last year to bring new capital into the industry. The mergers, designed to take advantage of tax laws before they expired on Dec. 31, 1988, have been criticized by some who complain the deals were too expensive. Under the plan, steel companies, home builders, investors and other non-traditional thrift owners bought up groups of insolvent institutions and packaged them into new entities. Four of the five largest <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts were created under the Southwest Plan. `` In the final accounting, which wo n't be done for several years, these <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plan </LOCATION> deals might look better than they do today, based on the cost of resolutions that the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is experiencing,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, an industry consultant in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` I guess he had just taken about all the flak he could take,'' said H.R. `` Bum'' Bright, whose <ORGANIZATION> Bright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> was seized by regulators earlier this year. `` We thought he had fundamentally a reasonable program on his original <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION>, one that would work out that would be less cost to the taxpayers than the subsequent plans appear to be from our standpoint.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pledger </PERSON>, commissioner of the Savings and <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> had the toughest job in government because of the magnitude of the problems.'' He praised <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s attempts to focus public attention on the healthy portion of the industry. `` He has been able to ... maintain a approach that recognizes that a large portion of the thrift industry is profitable and is doing well.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust division Monday recommended approval of a partial merger of the two daily newspapers in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> under a joint operating agreement. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rill </PERSON> recommended that the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> dailies be allowed to combine commercial and production facilities but continue to publish separate editions. <PERSON> Rill </PERSON> found that because of circulation and advertising losses, the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> was `` in probable danger of financial failure'' and therefore qualified for the antitrust exemption granted by the Newspaper Preservation Act. Under the law, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> must make the final decision whether to allow the proposed joint operating agreement to proceed. If the agreement becomes effective, <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> would be the 21st city where daily newspapers operate under such an arrangement. <PERSON> Rill </PERSON>'s report said that financial records show that the morning <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> has lost $ 13 million since 1981 as a result of a substantial decline in circulation and advertising in recent years. Circulation of the Sun has shrunk from 58,000 in 1982 to 52,000 last year while advertising linage has dropped from 2 million column inches in 1984 to 1.3 million in 1988, the division's report said. During the same period, the circulation of the all-day <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> Review-Journal has increased from 93,000 in 1982 to more than 130,000 last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Review-Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s advertising linage has gone up from 2.9 million column inches in 1984 to nearly 3.1 million inches in 1988, the report said. The Review-Journal, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Donrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, `` holds a commanding lead in the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> daily newspaper advertising market'' over the Sun, which is owned by the family of its founder, the late <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspun </PERSON>.

 Economic reforms under way in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> should help speed the integration of the two economies into the international trading system, senior officials of the two nations said Monday. <PERSON> Zdenek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON>, deputy director at the Czechoslovak <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, said the process of decentralization and elimination of state central planning was not a short-term measure but a `` serious process of reshaping our economy and society.'' Speaking on the opening day of the annual meeting of the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> said existing and planned reforms were designed to create the political, legal and economic basis for <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s increased involvement in the world economy. <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> called on other countries to help economic liberalization in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> by easing trade restrictions, citing the example of European Community limits on certain Czech exports. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s deputy minister for foreign economic relations, Dr. <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaczurba </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> planned to renegotiate its terms of membership of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> as part of the Solidarity-led government's efforts to `` build a liberal, efficient and open economy. He said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> wanted to normalize its status in the international body and adopt the `` normal commitments based on tariff concessions,'' and other trade liberalizing agreements. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> became a member of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1960s after giving a promise to increase its imports from other member countries by 7 percent per year. But it did not commit itself to other <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules, such as those on import duties, quotas and subsidies. <PERSON> Kaczurba </PERSON> told the meeting that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had a new tariff schedule to conform with <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules, and was in the final stages of talks with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> on convertibility of foreign exchange, liberalization of imports and the dismantling of domestic subsidies. The meeting also heard thinly-veiled criticism of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for its threats to use a new section of its trade act to retaliate against countries accused of unfair restrictions against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports if its grievances were not settled in bilateral talks. <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbot </PERSON> said the tendency toward bilateralism and unilateral solutions to trade difficulties were a `` danger'' to <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>'s multilateral system. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Balkrishan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zutshin </PERSON>, appealed against `` this approach of contention and confrontation,'' although he did not refer to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> directly. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was one of three countries singled out for potential retaliation under Section 301 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade act because of its restrictions on foreign investment. Texts of speeches to the closed meeting were made available to reporters. In addition to hearing general observations on the world trading system, the meeting adopted by consensus a report by a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> arbitration panel that ruled against Canadian restrictions on certain dairy imports, a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> official said on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Weekes </PERSON>, said he would not block adoption of the report, though <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would continue restricting imports of yogurt and ice cream pending new rules on agriculture drawn up as part of the ambitious <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of Trade liberalizing negotiations. The four-year round is scheduled to end next December. In the Canadian case, raised by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> argued its restrictions were a necessary part of its program to manage the domestic supply of dairy products. The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> official also said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had agreed to the establishment of a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> panel to look into a complaint by Candada against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> duties on Canadian pork exports. Members of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, which draws up world trade agreements and acts as a mediator in trade disputes, account for more than four-fifths of the world's international trade.

 <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been fined $ 50,000 for allegedly failing to make sure safety equipment was up to standards at its <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear plant, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The alleged violations involved water pumps and valves that were of commercial quality and did n't meet federal specifications for nuclear safety equipment, said <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. In one case, the impeller of a backup pump used to bring in sea water for cooling had only five vanes instead of the required seven. `` For seven weeks, that pump was not capable of fulfilling its safety function,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. The St. Petersburg-based utility, which has 30 days to either pay the fine or appeal it, has corrected all of the violations listed in the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> fine, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. He said the alleged violations came as the utility was in the process of trying to upgrade its safety equipment to meet new, more stringent guidelines imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> last March. `` We were making an honest effort to meet federal guidelines within the window of direction we had from the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. The utility was fined $ 100,000 by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> in September for the alleged inability of some safety equipment to operate under post-accident conditions, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said.

 The No. 1 gaming device maker in the world filed a federal lawsuit Monday against a Japanese company, claiming the foreign firm is using three of the larger company's patents to make slot machines. International Game Technology filed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Sparks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, subsidiary that makes the slot machines. `` We believe that most if not all of Sigma's slot machines on the market infringe on our patents,'' said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, representing Reno-based <ORGANIZATION> IGT </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefanik </PERSON>, director of operations for Sigma Game, said the company was unaware of the suit, which claims its slot machines are copies of patented <ORGANIZATION> IGT </ORGANIZATION> slot machines. `` Everybody uses these types of slot machines,'' <PERSON> Stefanik </PERSON> said. `` So their reasoning behind the lawsuit is beyond me.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> IGT </ORGANIZATION> wants to force Sigma to change its slot machines so they do n't use patented IGT slot devices. <ORGANIZATION> IGT </ORGANIZATION> also seeks unspecified damages to compensate for any business the company might have lost because of the alleged patent infringement, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` These devices were patented for a reason _ because they have unique elements,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> IGT </ORGANIZATION>, which had revenue of $ 140 million last year, has a similar lawsuit pending against a different Japanese company, <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, and its Nevada-based subsidiary company, Universal Distributing of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> In that lawsuit, patent infringement is n't claimed, but <ORGANIZATION> IGT </ORGANIZATION> alleges Universal used <ORGANIZATION> IGT </ORGANIZATION>'s trade secrets in manufacturing a video poker game named `` Player's Edge.''

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Upholds Judgment Against DeLorean</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court ruled Monday that a British court's award of a $ 54 million default judgment against former automaker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON> can be enforced against him. A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld a lower court's ruling against <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON>, who tried to prevent enforcement of the British court's award. Last month in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, however, <ORGANIZATION> English </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> overturned a lower court order that allowed legal documents in the case to be served on <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON> at his home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, outside the jurisdiction of the English courts. `` It follows that all subsequent orders made against Mr. <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON> will fall away,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said in his Nov. 24 ruling. In October 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> division in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> awarded the default judgment against <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> DSQ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd.. DSQ Property, formerly <ORGANIZATION> DeLorean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, then sued in January 1989 in federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to enforce the British court's judgment against <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON>, who had produced cars through <ORGANIZATION> DeLorean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cars </ORGANIZATION> The cars were distributed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> DeLorean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owned 75 percent of <ORGANIZATION> DeLorean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> federal court transferred the case to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, where Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Suhrheinrich </PERSON> ruled that the British court's judgment could be enforced against <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON>. <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON> appealed, but the 6th Circuit appeals court ruled against him Monday. In last month's ruling in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said that in DSQ's application to serve documents on DeLorean outside <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> jurisdiction, there had been `` serious non-disclosures'' of matters, including the existence of proceedings against <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unrelated to DSQ <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Morganroth </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON>, said Monday night that the <ORGANIZATION> 6th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling was moot since the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had set aside the judgment against <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON>. DSQ Property Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> was created as the corporate successor to <ORGANIZATION> DeLorean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which went into financial receivership The British court's judgment and DeLorean's settlement with the bankruptcy trustee of <ORGANIZATION> DeLorean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which filed for bankruptcy in October 1982, resulted from claims involving the design of the DeLorean automobile. The 6th Circuit appellate court rejected <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON>'s arguments that his settlement with the bankruptcy trustee prevented recognition or enforcement of the British court's award in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The court also rejected <PERSON> DeLorean </PERSON>'s arguments that he had not been properly served with documents to inform him of the British court's award. <PERSON> Morganroth </PERSON> said he expects DSQ Property to appeal the British court's ruling.

 <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a 37-year <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> veteran, was named president and chief operating officer of the company Monday and said he was confident <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' diversification away from military work will go well `` We're not abandoning the defense sector. We regard that as our duty to the nation. But we feel that in the future most of the growth and opportunity are outside defense,'' said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> replaces <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who retired Dec. 1. Like all military contractors, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> was looking at cuts in real defense spending even before the recent avalanche of change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The satellites and defense electronics company responded by moving into such areas as telecommunications and simulation and training systems for commercial airlines. It recently won a $ 325 million contract to modernize <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s air-traffic control system, and is bidding on a $ 210 million contract to modernize data processing for the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm an upbeat, positive sort of fellow and I think the company's future is very good,'' said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 58, joined the company in 1952 as a design engineer. He worked on fighter weapons systems, the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> missile program and the F-A-18 radar program. He most recently served as executive vice president for operations after vice presidencies in the radar systems and missiles groups. He becomes president as <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> unit, finishes a six-month streamlining that includes layoffs of 8 percent, or 6,000, of its 75,000 workers, another response to tighter defense budgets. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said the downsizing had met its objective of reducing the company to the proper size for the next two or three years. He said it was impossible to tell whether more layoffs would be needed later given current uncertainties. If the government decides to cut the number of military personnel while upgrading technology, `` We obviously are well-poised,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. `` We're usually, though not always in the forefront in defense electronics,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. `` And many of the technologies we developed for defense are easily adaptable to non-government sectors.''
